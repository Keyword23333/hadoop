7690033 after such blindness that would be a dismal thing to do
7690034 it was so blind of you to come and you are very nice but when you start to carp and whine its better to think twice we have our dayglo jumpsuits we wont always play nice
7690035 to play them such a trick when they have lapped up all our bilge and rallied round so quick

7690038 but weve got a leader and i think hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances
7690039 hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances and the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7690040 we are led by a very talented person in brendan nelson who has my full support who i believe is doing a great job and will lead us to the next federal election
7690041 i took him at his word at that and my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics
7690042 but he will make his position clear i suspect in the next two or three weeks
7690043 theres no leadership hassle going on in the party at all
7690044 brendan nelson is doing a fantastic job and i dont think its necessary at this stage we have a lot of talent in the liberal party federally
7690045 i am a big supporter of brendans and i want him to stay there
7690046 peter said after the last election that he was going to go and start another life i took him at his word
7690047 i think brendan nelsons leadership is fantastic brendan nelson is man who is continuing to take the fight up to the labor party

7690052 masalah kemiskinan di perkotaan tidak boleh diselesaikan dengan cara tunggal pemkot seharusnya terlebih dahulu mencari tahu mengapa mereka sampai datang ke jakarta inilah akar masalah yang harus dijawab
7690053 setelah pemda menemukan akar permasalahan mereka dapat berkoordinasi dengan pemda di daerah daerah bahwa ternyata lahan lahan di desa sudah sangat terbatas pemda harus memfasilitasi mereka alih profesi ke home industry misalnya tentunya hal ini juga harus diikuti dengan bantuan modal dan pemasaran

7690061 kenaikan tarif itu harus disertai dengan kebijakan lain yakni mengalokasikan minimal 10 persen dari total penerimaan pajak kendaraan bermotor untuk pembangunan jalan dan infrastruktur
7690062 bila ada usulan terhadap regulasi retribusi daerah menyangkut kendaraan sudah pasti akan ditolak departemen perindustrian dan pengusaha industri otomotif sebab tidak mendukung peningkatan produksi mobil nasional
7690063 mereka pasti akan menilai kenapa pemerintah menerapkan kebijakan yang tidak probisnis di tengah bergairahnya industri otomotif nasional seharusnya pemerintah menerapkan kebijakan yang terbaik agar terbangun iklim bisnis yang kondusif misalnya memberikan berbagai kemudahan dan menyiapkan infrastruktur yang memadai
7690064 apakah kenaikan itu bukan disebabkan kerusakan jalan munculnya terminal bayangan di pusat keramaian lalu lintas usia kendaraan yang sudah tua atau munculnya pasar tumpah

7690075 we could take every plastic bag and polystyrene product available in toronto none of this material has to go to landfill
7690076 the new blue bin system was introduced to recycle these materials so why is toronto giving up on the program now

7690140 the popularity of electronic marketing has too often left a gap in the more human aspect of the promotional mix for many small to medium sized companies
7690141 a professional voice on the other end of a telephone connection remains a viable means for lead generation prospecting and other functions associated with sales and business cycles however given the perceived low tech nature of telephone based cold calling marketing it can easily be overlooked to the detriment of a balanced well rounded marketing plan

7690153 russ and tari i know the alternate meanings of what was written but considering the sneering against rafa in a certain regard i thought the words were chosen for a purpose
7690154 and phau has been very impressive so far didnt think a 1st round match involving nadal would be this tight
7690155 now that rafas number one hes taken to wasting break point opportunities just like federer did
7690156 you could never out angst the fed fans during a match
7690157 it seems to take a lot longer to wait for rafa to serve when youre following the scoreboard and not watching the match
7690158 but thats not really how a us open contender should play
7690159 alas im a selfish little person and i like watching good tennis
7690160 jenn i made up arb it stands for the anti rafa brigade they are numerous

7690163 and rafa especially seems so mentally strong out there that its enjoyable to be reminded that hes not 100 mentally strong 100 of the time these days
7690164 i thought carrie just had the lettering backwards for anybody but rafa i am not anti rafa
7690165 i am personally a member of the asb anti soderling brigade

7690170 but with laver and spanish golf star sergio garcia in attendance at arthur ashe stadium phau continually pushed the worlds top ranked player in a match that lasted 2 hours 59 minutes

7690233 the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally and this is one of the most difficult teams to coach
7690234 theyre attacking off everything and theyre going lateral not through defences you have to go through sides like australia and new zealand first
7690235 but he has to change his philosophy because it doesnt fit these players its not credible
7690236 peters big test now is to learn if he learns he can turn it around but if he continues to be stubborn he wont last long because his tactics wont work
7690237 if a company is doing badly then you blame the managing director so it is right and fair that the coach be held responsible
7690238 we should have won the opportunities were there but we just let them slip
7690239 im not going to panic because having watched the video again i saw how great we played
7690240 decision making in split seconds is new to the guys and it has been a bit worrying the onus is now on the player but they want to be in a confined group where they are comfortable

7690244 the people who were living there were asking themselves what does he think weve been doing all these thousands of years
7690245 wonderful opportunity for canada to build on our sovereign claims
7690246 a complete lack of seriousness on the part of the harper government in dealing with the crisis of climate change which is having such a devastating impact across canadas arctic
7690247 if you dont deal with climate change if youre not serious about becoming a world leader on climate change you are directly failing the people of the north

7690266 prime minister nouri al maliki said monday there would be no security agreement between the united states and iraq without an unconditional timetable for withdrawal a direct challenge to the bush administration which insists that the timing for troop departure would be based on conditions on the ground
7690267 no pact or an agreement should be set without being based on full sovereignty national common interests and no foreign soldier should remain on iraqi land and there should be a specific deadline and it should not be open
7690268 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7690269 any decisions on troops will be based on conditions on the ground in iraq
7690270 that has always been our position it continues to be our position

7690278 i hate that michelle obama i hate her so much
7690279 because shes just a loud mouthed ignorant woman i cant stand her
7690280 and how is she different from you what shes black and on tv is that it you cant stand that oooo a black woman on tv run her out of fucking town what did she ever say that has made you sit here and say you hate her
7690281 she needs to just keep her mouth shut i just cant stand her thats all i dont have to like her so i dont
7690282 but but that makes no sense do you still hold to the she said she wasnt proud of her country rhetoric is that what it is do you think people should be judged on a sound bite for their entire lives shit i havent been proud of my country since bush pissed away everything after 9 11 but i damn sure am now im very proud of it because were getting rid of that motherfucker or do you not respect a woman who is well educated who has had her own career but chosen to raise two children while her husband works do you hate her for that do you hate that she asked barbara walters for a fist bump on the view what she makes speeches she has opinions so do you so do i you are one of the most outspoken women i know and you hate someone who speaks out for her husband who is campaigning for him what in the fuck

7690288 the 335i could have been a supercar a decade ago but the new m3 puts it in the shade weve made this point before but its an
7690289 like i told the offense for about a minute and a half out there they looked like a million dollars the shortest run they made was probably 25 yards today we ran better than we threw but after that drive the offense simply could not get anything together
7690290 the quarterback would miss people that were open then wed drop one
7690291 i dont think we were ready to play from the get go those two days off that we had really kind of put us behind offense is about getting into a rhythm thats no excuse we have got to step up to the plate and get our minds right no matter what the conditions are and be ready to play
7690292 let me be clear our government will not reopen the debate on abortion

7690315 in the second set i told myself to just play your game and dont give up
7690316 i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes

7690318 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world

7690392 far too politic to refer to the commander in chiefs may 1 2003 declaration of mission accomplished but petraeus acknowledged that this policy of modesty in the face of success is very much informed by our premature victory ejaculations of previous years before he took charge of course

7690400 why have recent republican presidents turned again and again to catholic jurists when making appointments to the supreme court it may be partly an effort to woo catholic voters but mostly its because so many of the brightest stars in the conservative legal firmament are catholics several scholars said
7690401 i do think that there is an important truth in saying that catholics are the intellectual pillars of social conservatism compared to their political allies in that movement catholics are heirs to a richer intellectual tradition and are more inclined to believe that reason supplies good grounds for the moral and political positions characteristic of social conservatism call it the natural law thing
7690402 music in the liturgy we should start by saying that gregorian music is the churchs precious heritage
7690403 it should stay it should not be banished if therefore in a particular diocese or country no one hears gregorian music anymore then somebody has made a mistake somewhere
7690404 the local church should be conscious that church worship is not really the same as what we sing in a bar or what we sing in a convention for youth therefore it should influence the type of instrument used the type of music used
7690405 i will not now pronounce and say never guitar that would be rather severe
7690406 but much of guitar music may not be suitable at all for the mass yet it is possible to think of some guitar music that would be suitable not as the ordinary one we get every time but with the visit of a special group etc
7690407 vatican ii brought many good things but everything has not been positive and the synod recognized that there have been shadows
7690408 there has been a bit of neglect of the holy eucharist outside mass
7690409 a lot of ignorance a lot of temptations to showmanship for the priest who celebrates facing the people
7690410 if he is not very disciplined he will soon become a performer
7690411 even when there was the tridentine mass there were abuses many catholics did not know because they did not know latin so when the priest garbled the words they were not aware of this
7690412 therefore the most important area is faith and fidelity to that faith and a faithful reading of the original texts and their faithful translations so that people celebrate knowing that the liturgy is the public prayer of the church

7690433 we used ray last year on the practice squad to run routes for the defense as an offensive receiver and he really did a good job
7690434 i think he can play both receiver and defensive back at a competent level
7690435 he is a tough kid he runs hard he catches the ball well and he showed up in the kicking game his versatility is his number one strength at this point but when he does play he has been productive in defense special teams and offense he is a unique guy

7690451 if they convey that sense of passion and focus and they bring their own stories into it the issues will take care of themselves
7690452 but too often democrats think its an intellectual debate about policy nuances that aint it and thats why weve lost in the past sometimes weve got to make sure people understand who these people are
7690453 our number of confirmed cases will include anyone that had this strain in their body at the time of death whether its the actual cause of death or not
7690454 did we find it absolutely not we did not find that listeria

7690456 were inspected regularly by the canadian food inspection agency all of our plants are federally registered the highest level of food safety in canada and they have full time inspectors on site
7690457 i am constantly troubled by the lack of surveillance information on food borne and water borne illnesses in canada
7690458 could not ignore the lethal success of suicide squads and their fearsome impact on the psyche of the indian state and security forces
7690459 pursue deeper political reform or whether the success of the games and the muted western response to repression will convince leaders that their current model is working and lastly
7690460 theyre all really lucky to get out of there i think there was somebody on their side
7690461 they could smell the fuel so they didnt waste any time getting out
7690462 but weve got a leader and i think hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances
7690463 hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances and the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7690464 we are led by a very talented person in brendan nelson who has my full support who i believe is doing a great job and will lead us to the next federal election
7690465 i took him at his word at that and my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics
7690466 but he will make his position clear i suspect in the next two or three weeks
7690467 theres no leadership hassle going on in the party at all
7690468 brendan nelson is doing a fantastic job and i dont think its necessary at this stage we have a lot of talent in the liberal party federally
7690469 i am a big supporter of brendans and i want him to stay there
7690470 peter said after the last election that he was going to go and start another life i took him at his word
7690471 i think brendan nelsons leadership is fantastic brendan nelson is man who is continuing to take the fight up to the labor party
7690472 what is very clear is that there isnt any economic leadership
7690473 is the best thing youll ever do in your life
7690474 im john mccain and did i mention i was a p o w
7690475 are you disappointed with canadas medal totals at the beijing olympics
7690476 they expected them to get 16 and they have 18 so im very proud of them
7690477 we sent 320 people to the olympics and maybe five would be qualified to compete
7690478 from now on if they are not able or qualified to compete they should not be allowed to go to the olympics
7690479 if youre 12th or 15th this doesnt work we cant afford to keep sending you there
7690480 but im also very sad because our athletes are good but they are not treated fairly by the judges and we just sit back and let them get away with this
7690481 there is serious underhanded stuff going on in the background
7690482 will parliament function normally this fall where the government is the government and the opposition is the opposition anarchy or where the opposition is the bartolucci weighs in on legacy

7690487 saya yakin pak marwan tahu betul prosedur memanggil kepala daerah itu harus izin presiden pernyataan itu mungkin bukan ditujukan pada awang
7690488 ngak ada yang dikecualikan apa cuti atau tidak tetap harus izin presiden
7690489 saya nggak banyak tahu soalnya waktu jadi wakil bupati saya kurang dilibatkan masalah pencairan pinjaman tanya bpd saja deh
7690490 sebagai warga negara yang baik saya siap untuk memberikan keterangan
7690491 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7690492 i imagine nothing would keep him away from a democratic convention
7690493 theres been some studies apparently by previous governments of this i havent seen them which has said it may not work
7690494 but we want to have another look at it because its a positive constructive idea lets see if it works
7690495 when it comes to sports funding its not either or either community sport or elite sport well be doing both
7690496 the kids who are engaging in community sport a lot of them want to have the hope in their eyes that they can rise to elite representational levels as well
7690497 the government is funding a large slab of investment in community level sport school sports indigenous sports but also were not going to be back tracking when it comes to funding for olympic level sports either
7690498 for the average joe blow out there in the community if you actually provide false testimony deliberately then that is perjury why should parliament be any different

7690503 the springboks will get worse if they continue in this way
7690504 mate no one in world rugby is playing the way their coach is talking about not successfully anyway
7690505 everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game
7690506 this is still a very good squad of players most are even at their peak or approaching it so there is plenty of talent but what they need is the organisation and discipline
7690507 the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally and this is one of the most difficult teams to coach
7690508 theyre attacking off everything and theyre going lateral not through defences you have to go through sides like australia and new zealand first
7690509 but he has to change his philosophy because it doesnt fit these players its not credible
7690510 peters big test now is to learn if he learns he can turn it around but if he continues to be stubborn he wont last long because his tactics wont work
7690511 if a company is doing badly then you blame the managing director so it is right and fair that the coach be held responsible
7690512 we should have won the opportunities were there but we just let them slip
7690513 im not going to panic because having watched the video again i saw how great we played
7690514 decision making in split seconds is new to the guys and it has been a bit worrying the onus is now on the player but they want to be in a confined group where they are comfortable
7690515 if you cant take care of your own house you cant take care of the white house

7690522 its very upsetting and frustrating because we get requests for milk every day
7690523 we need a milk bank for babies who cant get their nutritional needs met by their mothers donated milk can prevent serious infection in babies save lives and greatly improve health outcomes
7690524 we wanted to let these guys know that were in awe of what they do every day
7690525 fans cheered people like me and tom and called us celebrities or stars
7690526 people throw around the word hero a little too loosely im no hero these guys are heroes those 19 guys on the wall were true heroes
7690527 these firemen are the people you should really look up to kid theyre real heroes they respond to fires every day to save lives sometimes they even respond to terrorist attacks were here to say we dont forget their sacrifice
7690528 weve yelled and screamed over a thousand ball games in here
7690529 theres only about three or four of us left in the squad from that day
7690530 its really nice that the mets always remember us sometimes it feels like most of america forgets sometimes you forget yourself but then you look at that wall downstairs and you remember the guys who arent here
7690531 well a lot of those girls got pregnant back in those days they had to quit school

7690536 we dont get a lot of people come here to arco because its so small
7690537 idaho still enjoys a citizen legislature where we have the farmer rancher insurance salesmen representing the citizens i want it to stay that way
7690538 they were talking about raising minimum wage and im not really for it because it would make it harder for the entrepreneur run a successful small business
7690539 its such a family friendly community and it may attract some more people
7690540 its not the little small community like i grew up in
7690541 we want to make sure that everything we do is well planned out and well thought out
7690542 we need to make sure were protecting our neighborhoods protecting the residents making sure that were using good land use policy
7690543 with madisons new high school coming and our new hospital now i cant imagine that it wont double in the lifetime of our children
7690544 possession of a stolen firearm possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of a controlled substance
7690545 circumstances of the note placement and where it was written appeared to be legitimate
7690546 it appeared to have been written by a female if that person was forced from the area the note wouldnt have been easily found but some one did find it and called it into law enforcement
7690547 but when you look at the cash perspective there is no surplus were going to have to take another month to look at this amublance service and decide if you want to continue to supply this service or not its extremely expensive and we cannot maintain it

7690551 we have more political legal grounds than kosovo to have our independence recognized
7690552 when i say we i mean both south ossetia and abkhazia
7690553 it is unjustified it is against the norms of international law and poses a challenge to the world community
7690554 theyre a matter for the international community through the mechanisms at the united nations

7690562 it feels more like you are trying to puncture a lung than give me an orgasm
7690563 that just makes me numb varying your rhythm keeps it interesting
7690564 its like getting hit on the side of the head with a big wave
7690565 you cant just go in and feel your way around
7690566 let me do it to you and see how you feel about it
7690567 it stays wet in there a long time and ends up feeling sticky
7690568 but once youve hit the spot and im enjoying myself stay with it i dont want you to move on to something new
7690569 and it makes it seem like were only there to please you and do your bidding
7690570 i cant stand it when men act like they know everything and instead of pleasing you all theyre trying to do is please themselves selfish bastards
7690571 i hate it when a guy thinks cleansing your face with his tongue is considered french kissing
7690572 i hate it when guys are completely naked but forget to take off their socks
7690573 my biggest pet peeve is when a guy is eating you out and he separates it and opens it like its a science project its as if hes taking notes that he has to study before he does anything and you totally fall asleep while youre waiting for him to handle his business
7690574 i hate when guys pressure you to orgasm they get really pissed off when you just assume that theyre god and can make any woman cum
7690575 i cant stand when the sex goes on too long and youre just not into it anymore
7690576 it was not quite the bodys rejection of the defibrillator
7690577 but its a means for a body to cleanse itself of something foreign to it
7690578 we werent even sworn in yet and he was already determined to break the lock that lobbyists had on washington klobuchar said
7690579 we said drug company lobbyists shouldnt be able to prescribe our health care and we said that never again will energy policy be made from an undisclosed location klobuchar said to cheers
7690580 our party and our country have been strengthened by her candidacy
7690581 we have started to reclaim the american dream for all americans
7690582 we cant afford any more of the same failed republican policies
7690583 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7690584 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7690585 i think this year we have come out with a better pace in training camp we have come out with a better sense of urgency in practice knowing we dont have a warm up game or anything that gets us ready for the season opener we have to be ready for the first game
7690586 this game could kind of set the stage for our season no matter the outcome of the game we can learn a lot with it being a non conference game its not playing a good opponent four or five games into the season now we get to learn about ourselves in the first game
7690587 i feel good i feel confident i think preparation is going good so far we have a couple of extra days since this is the first game i think the guys are striding very well everythings getting put in and we feel very good
7690588 you know hes just a tremendous athlete a big play guy he works hard he doesnt come in with a big head like a lot of freshmen hes come in and earned his spot and showed the rest of the team on offense that he works for everything that he gets
7690589 he makes good catches every day but i think its just the way he comes to practice every day and doesnt expect everyone to give it to him that has impressed me the most as highly as he was ranked out of high school and all the publicity he has gotten he could have kind of very easily just thought he was going to walk into it but he has come in with a good attitude and good work ethic
7690590 the thing about being young is that you really dont know what else to expect so going into it there probably wont be too many nerves because everything happens so fast for those guys they have never been there never traveled on the road some guys have never flown on a plane before so it will be different for them but it will be happening so fast the game will be there and we have played so many football games growing up that it will just be like second nature and it will turn on for those guys
7690591 no im not concerned at all we have very good leaders who have brought everybody through camp getting ready for the season i feel very confident in these young guys
7690592 more pressure less pressure i dont know i am just going to take it like another season i have started two before so i kind of know what to expect and what its going to be like i am just going to use that experience to try and benefit me
7690593 i think our team is a lot closer a lot better so thats what excites me guys are able to care about each other and happy to be around each other that makes coming to practice everyday enjoyable no matter what
7690594 when you look on film they have a lot of great talent they have good players and good coaching they play hard that alone makes you raise your level of play and your preparation thats what a lot of the guys have been doing
7690595 their speed not only on offense but defense stands out they have a lot of speed they have two really good safeties up front they are fast and physical they get after it thats what weve been looking at im been watching film on those guys since about april every time i watch film i realize another guy stands out they do a good job and we are going to have to be on our a game
7690596 im just looking forward to going out and competing im not going to boast or brag im just going to go out there and have fun and do what im supposed to do im just going to go have fun
7690597 all of them have to take the same steps its really up to us on the offensive line to get the guys out of the way so their reads can be easier we just want to go out there and have fun we are looking forward to clemson and preparing all our running backs are fast no running back is different from another i love blocking for all of them
7690598 i dont think the game feels different on any college they are on scholarship just like you are they did something right if they are starting at their position they are doing something right in their program as far as one game being different than the other one i dont think that is so
7690599 you guys watch them on saturdays you guys have seen what they can do they do it consistently they are fast and powerful their coaches know how to use them in order to be successful weve been preparing we have a good scheme to try to slow them down its going to be a great competition what you see is what you get with those guys they both can do the same thing when they have the ball in their hands they become different runners as far as before the snap and locations you have to be aware of where they are located
7690600 the opposite of fun anti fun the kind of person who sucks the fun right out of the room
7690601 i am constantly vibrating with anxiety about everything in the world
7690602 i didnt tell my family until i got home from the citizenship ceremony and then i framed it with the melancholy embrace of the inevitable
7690603 theyre not going to ask a 45 year old homo to bear arms dogs would be eating people in the streets before theyd call me so it was fairly safe
7690604 it always begins badly i have to turn off that editorial naysaying aspect of my personality while i do it
7690605 id wanted to get out of publishing ever since i got into publishing
7690606 my life is pretty inviolate i dont write about people i know my family or my sex life i dont expose myself personally in that way but when you write you do expose yourself on the page theres nothing you can do about that
7690607 its brilliant i was shocked to learn that you havent actually been to the united states where maxs comic novel is set
7690608 a slave is a man that waits on another to set him free
7690609 we started looking inside and what we found was a large proportion of these bats internally had severe hemorrhaging so they were full of blood
7690610 what happens when you fly through an area when the pressure s dramatically is the lungs overexpand and it causes breakages in all the small vessels around the lungs
7690611 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
7690612 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
7690613 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
7690614 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7690615 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7690616 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7690617 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7690618 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7690619 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7690620 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7690621 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7690622 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7690623 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7690624 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7690625 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7690626 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7690627 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7690628 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7690629 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
7690630 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7690631 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7690632 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7690633 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7690634 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7690635 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7690636 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7690637 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7690638 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7690639 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7690640 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7690641 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7690642 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7690643 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7690644 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7690645 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
7690646 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7690647 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7690648 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7690649 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7690650 a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war
7690651 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7690652 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7690653 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7690654 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7690655 suggests that battle for the presidency between the illinois senator and republican rival john mccain is all tied up
7690656 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7690657 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7690658 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7690659 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7690660 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7690661 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7690662 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7690663 in the process of expanding in europe germany is one of several possible future markets
7690664 we receive inquiries from all over the world there is enormous interest in current
7690665 according to our observations germany is a market that could soon be ripe for current
7690666 tv and the web amount to the same thing to us
7690667 unlike most broadcasters we do not only use television to attract people to the internet on the contrary people go to current com swap thoughts concerns and videos and then we bring the best of it to the tv screen
7690668 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7690669 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7690670 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7690671 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7690672 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7690673 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7690674 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7690675 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7690676 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7690677 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7690678 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7690679 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7690680 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7690681 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7690682 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7690683 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7690684 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7690685 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7690686 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7690687 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7690688 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
7690689 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
7690690 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
7690691 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7690692 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7690693 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7690694 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7690695 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7690696 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7690697 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7690698 i like what he says and theres something about him i trust im going to take a chance on him
7690699 the survey suggests that this the economy is an umbrella issue covering many other concerns including those relative to health care
7690700 if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system
7690701 given that a lot of people work for insurance companies a lot of people work for hmos youve got a whole system of institutions that have been set up
7690702 i believe that every american has the right to affordable health care i believe that the millions of americans who cant take their children to a doctor when they get sick have that right we now face an opportunity and an obligation to turn the page on the failed politics of yesterdays health care debates its time to bring together businesses the medical community and members of both parties around a comprehensive solution to this crisis and its time to let the drug and insurance industries know that while theyll get a seat at the table they dont get to buy every chair
7690703 and nothing illustrates obamas failure so far to put some meat on his campaign than his inability to nail mccain on this issue and to speak specifically and powerfully about his own excellent plan which he announced early in the campaign
7690704 the legislature doesnt police how the governor or anybody else implements their executive orders those are kind of in house rules and they dont have penalties
7690705 state parties dont make contracts using public money so im not sure that its a remedy that fits the problem
7690706 i really think this is the kind of policy that is better done in a public hearing with a lot of input and thoughtful consideration and very serious scrutiny to avoid the constitutional pitfalls and unintended consequences
7690707 i find it curious that hes chosen the first day of the democratic convention to do this with most of the springfield reporters out of town with most of the legislators and other advocates for different policy considerations in denver
7690708 he may say its a coincidence but i dont think anybodys going to buy that
7690709 the timing is all about trying to make something happen that he thinks will have some repercussions and doing it at a time when he can minimize those repercussions
7690710 has been looking forward to taking this positive action for some time
7690711 i cant comment on something i havent seen other than its controversial
7690712 and what its done is jeopardize the whole thing instead of just doing the right thing and signing the bill that the general assembly put on his desk and then bringing forth any other ideas he might have
7690713 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7690714 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7690715 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7690716 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7690717 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7690718 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7690719 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7690720 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7690721 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7690722 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7690723 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7690724 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7690725 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7690726 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7690727 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7690728 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7690729 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7690730 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7690731 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7690732 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7690733 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7690734 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7690735 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7690736 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7690737 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7690738 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7690739 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7690740 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7690741 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7690742 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7690743 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7690744 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7690745 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7690746 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7690747 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7690748 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7690749 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7690750 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7690751 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7690752 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7690753 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7690754 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7690755 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7690756 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7690757 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7690758 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7690759 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7690760 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7690761 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7690762 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7690763 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7690764 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7690765 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7690766 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7690767 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7690768 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7690769 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7690770 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7690771 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7690772 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7690773 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7690774 damn i wish there was a good sports book around here we could go to
7690775 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7690776 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7690777 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7690778 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7690779 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7690780 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7690781 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7690782 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7690783 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7690784 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7690785 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7690786 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7690787 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7690788 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7690789 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7690790 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7690791 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7690792 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7690793 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7690794 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7690795 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7690796 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7690797 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7690798 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7690799 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7690800 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7690801 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7690802 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7690803 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7690804 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7690805 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7690806 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7690807 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7690808 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7690809 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7690810 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7690811 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7690812 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7690813 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7690814 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7690815 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7690816 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7690817 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7690818 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7690819 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7690820 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7690821 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
7690822 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
7690823 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
7690824 this conference provides a timely opportunity for attendees to discuss the new hwc mact compliance standards
7690825 industry representatives consultants and regulators should not miss this chance to learn about how these alterations to emissions standards and operating requirements will affect their organization
7690826 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7690827 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7690828 we need more transparency particularly with regard to hedge funds and private equity funds they are the ones that are causing this thing to go under and theres no transparency no accountability we dont know how deep this problem is
7690829 from the financial perspective however these funds could be an important source of capital in our global economy wealth funds can bring benefits to our economy they have helped keep our banks afloat in the midst of the sub prime mortgage crisis and ensuing credit crunch they could offer a fresh infusion of capital fuel employment and stimulate the u s industry
7690830 punitive defensive regulation could be self defeating depriving us of potential benefits out of the fear of potential harm
7690831 the thing im most unsure about is how you rationalize competition and trade policy i think thats the single most difficult challenge that i will have as president
7690832 almost as deep in terms of dollars not liability as the savings and loan crisis
7690833 like most senate democrats in 1981 sen joe biden of delaware found president reagans tax cut proposal to be an irresistible force and voted for it after having twice voted for efforts to limit its scope
7690834 to offset the tax increases that otherwise occur inexorably each year as incomes rise with inflation lifting people into higher tax brackets
7690835 to limit personal income tax relief to one round of rate cuts and to tilt the relief toward those who earn less than 50 000 a year
7690836 every summer the beaches of long island are filled with women and girls on surfboards i am one of them as far as im concerned if the sun is shining the ocean is clear and the waves are clean the best board to be on is a surfboard i am sure that there are lots of successful professional women among my fellow surfers its a tough sport i have the injuries and scars to prove it its thrilling you need stamina and strength as well as some talent to keep improving you also need a desire to conquer yourself not just the ocean in other words all the stuff that you need to make it in the other boardroom at the office the first time you catch a wave it will rank as one of the best feelings in the world like falling in love the butterflies flit in your stomach sending a signal to your brain that gives you a euphoric feeling of taking flight you are flying on top of the wave even though its probably just the frothy white water breaking around you and lifting you along with it then you get bolder and better paddling out further and taking many hits as the ocean drags you along the seabed like a spin cycle on a washing machine a few hours later you will emerge and you arms will feel like they each weigh 100 lbs from all the paddling out and paddling in for the wave its all worth it
7690837 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7690838 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7690839 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7690840 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7690841 highly talented highly collaborative and highly experimental the portland cello project is a dream team of instrumentalists
7690842 to say that this is not your fathers cello ensemble is a vast understatement
7690843 the portland cello project liberate the cello and bring it back to the common folk kind of like those high life commercials where the distro driver self righteously shoplifts beer but you know with cellos
7690844 nobody brings chamber music to the masses like the portland cello project
7690845 no longer are cellists hiding in the wings reliving memories of traumatic junior high orchestra performances gone is the discomfiture of lugging around a huge stringed beast
7690846 throw out everything you ever thought you knew about string ensembles
7690847 comfortable asses or not a pcp performance is always something to base your week on
7690848 he didnt even think he would see the possibility for a black president
7690849 im doing this for maine not just because he is black but because the world has called him forth at this defining moment
7690850 i love the enthusiasm of people here the energy is just amazing
7690851 really the choice of joe biden in my opinion is tantamount to an admission barack obama himself lacks the necessary experience to be president
7690852 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant
7690853 should and will take actions to reduce the emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions
7690854 coal will continue to play a large and indispensable role in a greenhouse gas constrained world
7690855 it could be good for the nation if other corporate companies could emulate what standard bank has done to work with undp on an issue that is of national and global concern
7690856 el pilar de los tributos de bogot es el ica que tiene altos ndices de evasi n en bogot se le factura a 250 mil empresas que son manufactureras o comerciales y s lo hay 170 mil declarando

7690858 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7690859 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7690860 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7690861 i think i may have popped a blood vessel in my eye
7690862 could not quite hear what customer was saying at end of conversation sounded as if he were saying i effing hate effing sallie mae while biting down on a tube sock and smothering his head with a pillow but cant be sure i think customer had a nervous breakdown ps i hate my job
7690863 think the intangibles count a lot and the mets have finally become a team under jm they never were under randolph watching the success of tatis a reyes mruphy evans and easely should have brought some humility to those much higher paid
7690864 e 60 will examine the lengths some people will go to have more athletic kids
7690865 how many people are breeding kids specifically to be athletes
7690866 im not sure theyre breeding to create elite athletes theyre folks who are lesbians or same sex couples or mothers who never found mister right or its a heterosexual couple who cant have kids on their own so they go to the sperm bank and they go through the catalog and inevitably when youre like ok what are we going to pick you end up picking the stuff you prioritize and you value and there are a lot of people out there who want their kids to have athletic traits

7690868 joseph abboud loves big american guys and to prove it the apparel maker s parent ja apparel corp signed a three year deal to outfit 31 of the 32 national football league coaches with its suits and other men s wear the one coach who did not sign on hooded sweat shirt wearing bill belichik of the new england patriots
7690869 we love guys who are 35 to 54 we re not a metrosexual company
7690870 it was so cool to be a virgin again because i d never been to an olympics
7690871 generation y expect more from a company than just a salary and are looking for community and a company that shares their principles and respects their individuality as a result traditional incentives are holding little interest for them
7690872 there is a distinct clash of culture between the x amp y generations at the moment y are generally the workforce with x being the managers managers especially baby boomers think employees should do long hours at work and put the needs of the business above all else generation y employees believe that their work can be done without spending hours at work and at a time that is convenient to them
7690873 generation y are used to digital technology like playstations ipods etc that allows them to multi task this leads them to believe that its essential to do many things at once to complete tasks for example generation y employees cannot understand why they cant sit at their desk listening to their ipod whilst they work to attempt to do this will lead to disciplinary action by the typical baby boomer or generation x manager
7690874 mavericks are something to be encouraged not something to be stopped in terms of the work they are doing the way you work with mavericks has to be challenging and give them the freedom they need to carry out their role effectively whilst the new generation of maverick has slightly different expectations and skills they still need to be managed carefully to ensure their energies are channelled to make a positive contributing to the organisation
7690875 think of the song youd want to be played at your funeral
7690876 you will be required to find the song that you want played at your funeral you will then be required to play the song and display lyrics to the class you should choose the song that you want people to remember you by in addition you will have to write and deliver your own eulogy
7690877 would likely murder men simply because they appeared to be latino or african american
7690878 when a city is violating federal law and that violation of law leads to horrific consequences like this then the city has clearly acted in a negligent manner

7690893 there are theories about hormonal differences but none has been proved
7690894 its been documented in several studies that men are at increased risk of recurrence
7690895 this needs to be validated in a second study which we are currently planning
7690896 the study will take about two years to recruit patients and will have a one year follow up so results are expected in three years
7690897 one would be happy to be able to recommend stopping
7690898 the current recommendation is to remain on long term therapy but many patients elect not to do it

7691032 all of you are aware of the serious nature of this years fire season and the issues faced by the agency in paying for fire suppression costs
7691033 at this time the only option for financing the shortfall is to use the agencys transfer authority
7691034 the unfortunate thing is that it is across the board
7691035 i recognize that this direction will have a significant effect on agency operations
7691036 however we must be in a position to protect life and property from wildfire and do so within the funds available to the agency

7691060 after lisbon the taoiseach outlined a series of steps to analyse the result the department of foreign affairs was tasked with commissioning a comprehensive nationwide survey
7691061 the findings of that will feed into a public political debate
7691062 the minister for foreign affairs has been tasked with engaging with his european counterparts on the matter the taoiseach is due to report progress in the analysis to the european council in october but its not going to be a road map
7691063 nothing whatsoever has been decided vis a vis the next step because were only in the process of analysis at this stage
7691064 people who are saying another referendum or legislation they are all jumping ahead to an outcome and the government isnt anywhere near that
7691065 the important thing for the taoiseach is to find a way of ensuring that ireland stays at the heart of europe
7691066 the government has made it clear that no option has been ruled in or out we cannot exclude that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people once again
7691067 that is decidedly not saying you put the lisbon treaty as is before the people
7691068 what i did say and it is a matter of record was that we have to deal with all the issues that have arisen in detail step by step and should not jump to any conclusions or exclude any options
7691069 there can be no question of simply putting the same proposition to the people once again
7691070 show that the government has learned nothing from its disastrous referendum campaign another referendum on lisbon without any response to the concerns of th e irish people would be rejected
7691071 minister roches comments are yet another example of a government without a plan to tackle the political reality that the lisbon treaty is finished
7691072 while the government claims it will make no decision on this matter until after its detailed analysis of the referendum defeat has been completed and considered it is clear that it intends using the findings of this research to present to the public with the same rejected treaty dressed up as something new
7691073 i expected that she would be an enthusiastic contributor to the green partys future debates on lisbon
7691074 i believe this would be a better way to influence the partys thinking than issuing press releases for external organisations
7691075 i think it is very very clear that the people have said no and the irish government needs to stand up to its european counterparts

7691109 shamelessly stole the fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals
7691110 it was a crime what they did with the young men from our boxing team to complement the work of those who go about stealing athletes from the third world

7691112 its kind of a no brainer that thats your ticket

7691115 the obama campaign appears to be making an all out effort to win virginia by picking warner as the keynote speaker they are showcasing the most important and influential politician in virginia
7691116 hes the best example from virginia of a successful democrat
7691117 what ill try to do is tell the story of what we were able to accomplish in virginia in terms of getting democrats and republicans to work together where we had real results
7691118 this is a time when our country has to move past partisanship and i think can do that
7691119 its symbolic its a stamp of who the partys going to give voice to
7691120 poor george he cant help it he was born with a silver foot in his mouth
7691121 im so so excited the books really intrigued me when i was little and ive always loved the story i really love burton films big fish
7691122 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7691123 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
7691124 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7691125 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7691126 we are going into the future what did i walk into a time capsule
7691127 democrats will leave this denver convention unified organized and stronger than ever to take america in a new direction with barack obama and joe biden as president and vice president
7691128 republicans say john mccain has experience we say john mccain has the experience of being wrong
7691129 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7691130 we basically focused our first 20 years of business on sourcing local workers but it never works
7691131 dont get me wrong there are good local employees but its too easy for many to just cop out go on the dole and do something else
7691132 when one group drops out we can pick up on another but when we were just relying on one source we were always getting into trouble
7691133 if these guys are workers and they want to do it and i doubt very much theyre going to come all that way from overseas if theyre not then those expenses become irrelevant
7691134 the fair costs of training new people each season would be offset if you could keep getting the same people coming back every year
7691135 the australians were long shots but after creating a world record time of 5 36 2 minutes in the heats everyone was watching to see what they could do
7691136 he has great opportunities to move ahead in the four years leading up to these games hes had six international regattas well in the next four years hes going to double that
7691137 we know that prisoners try to use all avenues to get drugs into prisons
7691138 the strong working partnership between correctional services and the police corrections section is proving to be an invaluable weapon in fighting the prison drug trade
7691139 we are fortunate to have a couple of young convenors but we could certainly do with a lot more
7691140 it would be nice for some young ones to come and learn from the older people before they pull out because they are not able to do it any more
7691141 i can understand younger people getting discouraged but theres a lot of experience there they could learn from
7691142 the death of the lower murray would be an immediate and irreversible disaster for south australia
7691143 it would also be a catastrophe for victoria over the longer term
7691144 in the best case scenario this would open up the window of time that people could recover and go back to normal functional status
7691145 offers the potential for stroke patients to recover return to nearly normal functional status and stay out of nursing homes
7691146 we are encouraged that the results of the japanese and u s studies are consistent and both suggest that nitric oxide donation may allow a more sustained intraocular pressure lowering effect nicox and pfizer are in active discussions regarding the worldwide rights to pf 03187207 which we believe has a certain commercial potential which should be realized we are also pleased by the progress that has been made in the research program focused on diabetic retinopathy where we hope a lead compound will be selected in the first half of next year
7691147 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
7691148 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7691149 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7691150 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
7691151 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7691152 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
7691153 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise

7691164 this was a surprising and exciting finding our direct observations appear to totally undermine a key rule that has withstood the test of time for over a century we will now make observations with a range of other chemicals and with other techniques to further elucidate the molecular basis for our observations text books will have to be rewritten to revise a rule that has been relied on for over a century advanced techniques such as the one we have developed should give much clearer insight into the action of a wide range of drug molecules which will be of significant interest to drug developers
7691165 the attached print ad part of a series of similar ads run by glaxosmithkline is the most egregious example of this type of advertising this ad is designed to instill fear in the minds of aids patients by telling them that switching aids treatment presumably from gsk drugs may lead to increased side effects and potentially treatment failure this message is gsks response to the increased number of patients switching from its drugs to newer treatments and seeks to discourage aids patients from changing their antiretroviral arv regimens regardless of their medical needs further the explicit message in this ad avoid hidden dangers from switching your hiv medicine is that safety and efficacy information provided by a patients doctor or the fda is incorrect or misleading
7691166 the ads are part of a larger trend of drug companies taking aim at rival hiv drugs hinting at side effects and other drawbacks experts say
7691167 a development fueling the sharp elbows advertising the market for hiv medicines has grown crowded and companies want to protect their market share
7691168 can be deceiving avoid hidden dangers from changing your hiv medicines
7691169 if you are thinking about switching your hiv medicine make sure you know what youre getting into
7691170 with these latest ads gsk has sunk to a new low the company has resorted to exploiting patient fears in order to sell a product while remaining unconcerned about the harm caused to patients who are scared off treatment altogether because of gsks tactics
7691171 we are disappointed that poz magazine a publication targeted to an hiv positive population would run such ads this kind of underhanded negative advertising creates fear of hiv treatment in general which could dissuade people from seeking treatment at all we are also disappointed that despite repeated communication with the fda regarding our concerns over a similar gsk ad campaign last year there appears to be a total lack of oversight of direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs that is why we are appealing to hhs in the hopes that our concerns will be heard and these harmful ads pulled
7691172 unfortunately gsks advertising tactics only serve to amplify fears and doubts patients may already have about antiretroviral therapy making it harder for doctors to treat them
7691173 it is important for patients and their providers to work together to make treatment decisions independent of drug industry advertising that might compromise the doctor patient relationship and potentially the health of the patient
7691174 this just furthers the economic development we can bring to kansas and adds to our motor sports portfolio by allowing other forms of racing
7691175 we can cater to a whole new demographic with car clubs
7691176 we are trying to provide the best opportunity for kansas
7691177 we are going to continue creating wealth for the state
7691178 if we arent awarded the contract we just cant make it work
7691179 i dont know how to throw it in the mix at this point
7691180 these and other issues will come up and we will be asking them about that
7691181 the whole kennedy family will be in a special section it should be quite a moment
7691182 in a longstanding mystery smoking high cholesterol and lack of exercise should drive disease to develop evenly throughout all blood vessels but in reality atherosclerotic lesions tend to cluster where vessels branch
7691183 our study provides new insight into why and suggests how the protection afforded by the force of steady flow and simple stretch might be strengthened with drugs
7691184 obviously we should all be exercising to get our hearts pumping fast which increases blood flow force through our vessels
7691185 beyond that genetic engineers may in the future design gene therapy that delivers genes only into cells at blood vessel branch points to increase pecam 1 signaling alternatively drug designers might create super active fyn amplifying the signaling effects of pecam 1 phosphorylation to protect vulnerable areas of blood vessels from inflammation
7691186 we would ask people to bear in mind that there is limited capacity in the arrivals halls for large volumes of people
7691187 we can count on nea afl cio change to win
7691188 we are united in our determination to turn around america the work that all of us in this room will do will bring home the crucial working class vote for barack obama and joe biden
7691189 we worked our butts off across america to make obama the nominee
7691190 wherever we have races certainly at the local and state levels those members are integrated into our political program
7691191 i have seen those ads and i am hillary clinton and i do not approve of that message
7691192 and i ask each and every one of you to work as hard for barack obama and joe biden as you worked for me
7691193 we are not fighting to elect a particular president we are fighting to take our country back
7691194 the party is telling us just to suck it up
7691195 but only one step in the process it doesnt change the overall strategy
7691196 there is always a distant hope that the superdelegates will come to their senses and select a stronger candidate
7691197 if they dont they are going to be in trouble in november
7691198 i do not want barack obama to become the next president
7691199 i cannot validate his path to victory when its riddled with anti democratic methods
7691200 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
7691201 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
7691202 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
7691203 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
7691204 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
7691205 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
7691206 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
7691207 there is still a remnant of a real person in there
7691208 we complain that he talks too much but then we complain about people not talking to us
7691209 i have had to essentially hang up on him several times its like senator i understand but ive got to go really senator im on deadline ive got to go

7691218 its very hard to find muslims who say they are republican now
7691219 now they say theyre independent when you meet a muslim who says hes an independent it means he used to be a republican
7691220 the fact is we have achieved an amazing success simply convening this meeting
7691221 where are our muslim city councilmen we need more muslims in the schoolboard
7691222 i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7691223 im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
7691224 people know that i can give the kind of speech that i gave four years ago thats not the question on voters mind i think theyre much more interested in what am i going to do to help them in their lives
7691225 and so in that sense this is going to be a more workman like speech
7691226 why didnt you just come here when you saw the cop cars
7691227 but i just had to find out what was going on
7691228 as an ardent practicing catholic abortion is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7691229 minutes before the official announcement of pope benedicts election cardinal macharski points to the liberal reporters assembled in st

7691232 if were really going to move the needle to encourage people to change their commuting habits it seems to me its less about building trails and lanes to far flung
7691233 all those things they want to implement that would make it so much nicer said warren jenkins who rides his single speed green schwinn from downtown to his job at recycle bookstore on the alameda
7691234 the way things are going with cars and gasoline prices human power is going to be a lot more prominent its part of the solution right
7691235 bike share program similar to token operated luggage carts at airports would allow commuters to use a token or credit card to borrow bikes from a light rail station to get to work then return it when they get on the train home
7691236 every year were seeing more people get on their bikes she said
7691237 whats happening is that the transit facilities were built to handle a certain number of riders the demand is surpassing that
7691238 largely uptapped federal funding as well as valley transportation authority money to build the network of barricaded bike lanes
7691239 the cost will depend on how many corridors we identify and for how many miles
7691240 worf could hang onto it with one hand and swing it pretty hard
7691241 by those who have a power amp a collective will to shdrunk newse it

7691244 as long as the sex is good everything else will fall into place
7691245 for a million dollars how many houses do you have
7691246 could i just mention to you jay that at a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair and i didnt spent those five and a half years because not because i wanted to get a house when i got out you know im very proud of cindys father he was a guy that barely got out of high school fought in ww two in the army air corps came home and made a business and made the american dream and so somehow youve had cindy on this show and uh the fact is that shes extremely generous she goes around the world doing humanitarian stuff shes in now in georgia as we speak looking at the humanitarian aspects of the results of this russian invasion so im proud of my life and my record and we spend our time in a condominium in washington in a condominium in phoenix sometime over here in the state of california and we have a place up in northern arizona and my friends im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to with houses what it has to do with putting americans in houses and keeping in their homes and thats what im gong to do
7691247 practice i thought was pretty bad considering were five days away last day in pads
7691248 we did move up practice to try to beat the weather forecast we got out there and it rained pretty hard for about 10 15 minutes and i think the guys felt like any minute it was going to be over and then it blew over and it wasnt over and i can only hope that was the reason they lost their edge it looked like they lost their edge which is sad to say
7691249 it was not his call but hes out of the green right now no limitations
7691250 since tomorrow is the last day of any kind of tempo when it comes to putting pads on where something might happen that might change our decision on a close race or something it would probably be more than likely wednesday before we start talking about scrimmage downs

7691252 every time we lose im concerned because if youre losing youre generally not playing the way you need to play to win the game so we havent done that
7691253 those are the little things im saying that to you edwards as a player and young leader on your team
7691254 you have a veteran 1 300 yards last year fumbling on the two yard line that cant happen
7691255 you cant go three and out on offense and blow coverage assignments as a starting defensive unit you have a guy in domenik hixon who is not going to be the poster boy for receivers in anybodys fantasy football pool but here he is with two touchdowns as well as a punt return for a touchdown these are self inflicted negatives these are things we cant do if we do do them we wont be what everybody expects us to be this year
7691256 chud calls them sins self inflicted negatives theres a long list i think the list might be a little too long but he does have a couple quality points one is you cant beat yourself that was our problem last year we had too many situations where we beat ourselves
7691257 and im up while the dawn is breaking even though my heart is aching i should be drinking a toast to absent friends instead of these comedians

7691266 the nomination is decided we have a vice president we will work together to go forward every convention has its areas of disagreement to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive

7691272 first guide dog owners love to talk about their dogs whether it be the dogs breed type color could have thrown in height and weight here but forgot where they got the dog how long theyve had the dog how old the dog is what the dog had for dinner last night for breakfast this morning and on and on
7691273 yes those who have guide dogs may truly know what im talking about here
7691274 id like it to be a little bit more secure in who exactly is going to be doing the punt returning but i think weve made progress in some of the things we are doing
7691275 maybe it hasnt shown up statistically especially in the punt return game but weve made progress up front in our blocking both in kick return and punt return i think we are in a good spot right now we just have to settle on whos going to do it and we still have some options so we just have to play it out this weekend and see how it goes
7691276 i know aundrae allison can do it hes caught everything hes been asked to catch we havent given him a lot of opportunities from a blocking standpoint when hes been in there chuck gordon did it all through college at a high level so i know chuck can give us those repetitions and we know what bobby wade and bernard berrian can do so we have options its not like we dont have anyone its just we dont have a single guy right now that we can say will be taking all the reps thats not a bad thing either though weve got plenty of options and were going to use them as we go
7691277 hey act like you are pissed off at everything and write about it like andrew dice clay would except omit all the language
7691278 the legislature doesnt police how the governor or anybody else implements their executive orders those are kind of in house rules and they dont have penalties
7691279 state parties dont make contracts using public money so im not sure that its a remedy that fits the problem
7691280 i really think this is the kind of policy that is better done in a public hearing with a lot of input and thoughtful consideration and very serious scrutiny to avoid the constitutional pitfalls and unintended consequences
7691281 i find it curious that hes chosen the first day of the democratic convention to do this with most of the springfield reporters out of town with most of the legislators and other advocates for different policy considerations in denver
7691282 he may say its a coincidence but i dont think anybodys going to buy that
7691283 the timing is all about trying to make something happen that he thinks will have some repercussions and doing it at a time when he can minimize those repercussions
7691284 has been looking forward to taking this positive action for some time
7691285 i cant comment on something i havent seen other than its controversial
7691286 and what its done is jeopardize the whole thing instead of just doing the right thing and signing the bill that the general assembly put on his desk and then bringing forth any other ideas he might have

7691342 the developer didnt intend you to experience the game that way
7691343 an important thing is to consider the basic desires of people even if all youre thinking about is a simple game for example you have active desires freedom from fear as they say the way people actively want to avoid fear in their lives and one way they deal with that is by engaging in a sorting process
7691344 a lot of the fun in that game is the exhilaration you get when you flip a lot of pieces and make more of the board your color tidying up things in a way
7691345 by the same token some people think in the opposite way if i kill every enemy in the area then that logically means ill be more secure

7691370 double dipping is not right because a phony dishonest way for lawmakers to give themselves pay raises is not right
7691371 it creates an almost impossible situation for the lawmaker to do whats right for his or her constituents
7691372 absolutely not unless the governor believes that every legislator that has any other source of employment should have that outlawed including his wife who now has a job that is paid for by state funds the level of hypocrisy is just unbelievable
7691373 the governor has been one to use political influence over peoples jobs that he controls when he sees fit to do so
7691374 but the governors idea would say its ok for a state legislator for example to be a doctor at northwestern memorial hospital but not at county hospital

7691384 i believe the momentum is definitely on our side especially the last couple weeks with our signature drive

7691394 i feel this is the beginning of the new era in parliament the era probably when the executive has to find ways of negotiating with the legislature in order to put through programs
7691395 obviously as a party we are fully aware that we find ourselves in a situation where we have somebody claiming to be head of state which we know very well did not win that head of state
7691396 i had a heat rash and my mum thought that was meningococcal so she took me in on saturday night

7691413 although the major mechanism of bluetongue virus spread is undoubtedly that of culicoides midges feeding on infected ruminants growing the virus and then transmitting it to further susceptible animals other mechanisms may also be at work these may assume greater importance during the midge free season winter such as we in northern latitudes experience

7691416 i dont have any sense that this will somehow lead to a cure for pws but it does present a new area for those interested in the disease to study and hopefully a new understanding of how the disease functions
7691417 the benefits of the program accrued very quickly and are very large
7691418 when adults stop smoking you see immediate benefits in heart disease with impacts on cancer and lung diseases starting to appear a year or two later
7691419 we confirmed these results with a wide range of model reliability tests and sensitivity analyses to make sure that the findings we found were not a result of some unobserved third factor
7691420 for example including differences between california and the control states on a variety of risk factors did not materially affect the results
7691421 the methods in this study can be used to forecast future costs and will provide important additional means for validating program evaluations that previously did not exist
7691422 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
7691423 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
7691424 sleep may be the price you pay so your brain can be plastic the next day
7691425 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7691426 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
7691427 weve become very good at growing some bacterial species what might be called the weeds of the microbial world
7691428 but many other species cant be cultured by current methods
7691429 we have continued to refine our brand proposition with significant investment in price merchandise range and quality during the year

7691435 reports are that she approached the ips iraqi police saying she had the vest on and didnt want to go through with it
7691436 if she was forced to put on the vest or if she did it voluntarily that is still being reviewed
7691437 the surrender of the suicide bomber indicates that the iraqis are continuing to reject al qaeda and its practices
7691438 she came home from school a couple of times and said i got in trouble for doing a cartwheel

7691451 of course there should be a british team the fears of the scots the welsh and the northern irish of losing their independence are in my view groundless
7691452 they should simply join a british team there will be a uk football team we have the most magnificent football footprint better than any other olympic country
7691453 if you start to put together a combined team for the olympic games the question will automatically come up that there are four different associations so how can they play in one team
7691454 this will put into question all the privileges that the british associations have been given by the congress in 1946
7691455 the national team comes first and at the moment we are keen to keep our nationality intact we have to have a national scottish team and we cant put that in jeopardy so there has been no change
7691456 this will then not provoke a long and endless discussion of the four british associations
7691457 why mention this at all when everyone is on the crest of a wave over british success talk about midas in reverse
7691458 in scotland at the moment we dont have an international facility for cycling we dont have the coaching or anything else in place
7691459 i have been very proud to represent scotland at the comonwealth games and that is something i will always cherish but today we are here to celebrate being a part of the uk team scotland is part of britain they are not mutually exclusive
7691460 i am a proud scot and i am a proud brit and as far as scotland becoming an olympic nation is concerned there needs to be a lot of investment in facilities today is about the british team we are here to celebrate that

7691466 and i would say well yes john im a senator from mississippi and were the poorest state in the nation
7691467 but you know what in my heart i knew he was right
7691468 it got out of control with republicans and thats why we are being punished a little bit
7691469 because we forgot how we got there what we believed in the principles that after 30 years put us in the majority gave us the white house the congress the senate the house and then we ran out of ideas

7691481 the hearing is critical for all minority education institutions in bengal
7691482 the college has every right to obtain the minority certificate directly from the commission
7691483 we his department had set up a committee which has just recommended guidelines for granting minority status to institutions in bengal we believe things will improve but there can sometimes be a misunderstanding with the higher education department
7691484 but most minority run institutions in bengal prefer to approach the centre rather than the state government officials here are simply not sympathetic

7691511 these areas are host to some of the worlds most biodiverse coral reefs and habitat and some of the most interesting and compelling geological formations in all of our oceans
7691512 many areas in the proposed central pacific islands monument remain in a nearly pristine state
7691513 a recent study of kingman reef part of the proposed monument found a picture perfect healthy coral ecosystem that contained more fish than any other coral reef ecosystem in the world
7691514 the study also found that the area contains the worlds greatest proportion of top predators including sharks a key indicator of ecosystem health healthy reefs like those of the central pacific are also more resilient to changing climate
7691515 monument or sanctuary designation by itself does not necessarily convey a high degree of protection and could allow a host of activities including commercial and recreational fishing and deep sea mining among others
7691516 however if the president establishes these new sites as no take reserves where no extractive activity is allowed it would be one of the most significant environmental achievements of any u s president

7691528 were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7691529 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation

7691537 of course we are democrats so it may take a while were not the fall in line party we are diverse with many voices but make no mistake we are united
7691538 we are confident of victory you know why because everybody knows what is at stake
7691539 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7691540 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7691541 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7691542 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7691543 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
7691544 we had a concern that this was going to happen
7691545 it sang very pitchy tonight it needs to connect with the audience more

7691553 es una revoluci n construir un sistema de transporte m s amable porque representa dejar atr s una mentalidad en la que nos hemos hecho a la idea de que las decisiones deben estar enfocadas a movilizar veh culos y no a la gente
7691554 con una buena aceptaci n esos inconvenientes ser n atendidos en aspectos como el comercio informal que ocupa las entradas ya de la terminal de indios verdes
7691555 el objetivo de la planificaci n debe ser facilitar la movilidad de las personas no de los veh culos por obvio que parezca los gobiernos de am rica latina han olvidado esto
7691556 as que plantear un sistema de transporte para la gente implica un cambio cultural que busca superar la idea de que el transporte p blico es para los pobres los fracasados y el auto privado es s mbolo de xito
7691557 todas las ciudades latinaomericanas tienen el desaf o de c mo construir un sistema de transporte p blico que resuelva no s lo las necesidades de traslado de los pobres sino de los usuarios de autom viles que crean en las calles problemas para todos
7691558 obviously implying that they were plotting to replace curbishley however it would have been more suspicious if the three of them didnt talk but sat in silence pretending that they didnt know each other
7691559 mogen we groepen van 14 mensen doen want er willen veel mensen meedoen
7691560 er is geen seksuele gemeenschap in de rouwperiode na de dood van een chief mannetjes dieren moeten worden gedood de haan mag in die periode bijvoorbeeld niet kraaien de dode wordt naar het bos gebracht maar boven aarde gehouden tot er een larve uit zijn lichaam komt om getuige te zijn van die larve blijven een aantal aangewezen mannen en de opvolger bij de dode die larve kondigt het moment aan waarop de opvolger aan mag treden en de rouwperiode kan worden be indigd na de larve wordt het lijk begraven weduwen van de chief mogen niet meer hertrouwen als ze kinderen van hem ter wereld heeft gebracht
7691561 er wordt gezongen bij geboorte huwelijk en dood we hebben ook traditionele muziekinstrumenten zoals de harp
7691562 onze traditionele liederen bevatten boodschappen de traditionele muziek verdwijnt steeds meer weinig mensen weten nog hoe het gezongen en begeleid moet worden wij komen er steeds verder vanaf te staan er zijn ook drums die werden op verschillende manieren gebruikt om boodschappen te verspreiden een bepaald ritme kondigde bijvoorbeeld de dood van een chief aan
7691563 geef je toestel dat doen we voor je als je het zelf doet raak je het toestel in deze chaos zo kwijt
7691564 ze hebben mij aangegeven dat ik tot hier op moest trekken
7691565 en ze hadden jullie gezegd er niet van die kant tussen door te gaan omdat je dan vast komt te staan
7691566 dat is het argument van de mensen om geen millimeter ruimte te maken of om zelf het verkeer te regelen
7691567 de politie heeft geen gezag ze worden slecht betaald vandaag staken de onderwijzers die worden ook slecht betaald
7691568 we zijn er om van het leven iets te maken niet om het vernielen
7691569 daar had ik nooit aan gedacht dat je zo ook over democratie kunt denken en dat we het zelf uit konden voeren
7691570 ik heb nagedacht over het maken van onze regels dat moeten we eigenlijk ook in onze organisaties gaan doen daar worden de regels altijd door de leiding gemaakt en bewaakt dat hoeft dus niet
7691571 er waren vandaag veel spellen we hebben er plezier in gehad het waren geen gewone spellen er zaten diepe en zeer leerzame boodschappen in we kunnen de spellen daarom toepassen in de praktijk
7691572 iemand houdt zich aan zijn haar woord komt op tijd kan een geheim bewaren wordt door andere mensen vertrouwd laat zich niet in met prostitutie
7691573 als ze seks heeft met meerdere mannen als ze seks heeft met getrouwde mannen
7691574 dat zijn ook prostituees en die zijn dan ook niet meer integer
7691575 armoede verveling vanwege rijkdom en denken daarmee boven normen en de wet te staan lust niet kunnen beheersen ertoe geforceerd worden vanwege handel
7691576 in dat geval behouden de meisjes en vrouwen hun integriteit die meisjes en vrouwen moeten we helpen over die slechte ervaringen heen te komen
7691577 als de structuur van een cultuur vertrouwen bewerkstelligt kan ze dan ook jaloezie voortbrengen
7691578 ja de wet in rwanda is veranderd pareert hij en ook vrouwen hebben nu erfrecht dat is omdat het eerstgeboorterecht ongelijkheid in hield waaruit jaloezie voort kon komen
7691579 jaloerse mensen worden als onbetrouwbaar gezien kunnen kwaad in de zin hebben omdat ze ge soleerd raken ze kunnen kwaad doen zoals overgaan tot het vergiftigen of zelfs doden van anderen jaloezie wordt gevreesd
7691580 wie ervoor uitkomt dat hij jaloers is of wie van jaloezie wordt beticht weet dat hij onder de categorie slechte en daarmee onbetrouwbare mensen wordt geplaatst en van slechte mensen neem je afstand
7691581 we are amazed by what we did not expect this training to be this is the first training of this kind in nyamata this project is a healing tool for wounded hearts of course we can not heal everything but reduction of suffering will be possible
7691582 hier werken protestanten en katholieken wel samen dat is aan de oppervlakte uiteindelijk dienen ze met meer inzet hun eigen groep bij jullie is dat anders als protestantse kan je bij een katholiek cordaid werken en de inzet is evengoed hard werken de rol van religie is bij jullie erg afgenomen we denken dat het bij ons ook af zal nemen als ons land zich meer ontwikkeld wat denkt cora
7691583 als er weinig is waarvan je op aan kunt dan is er god die troost en uitkomst biedt
7691584 als ik niet bidt voor het slapen gaan heb ik slechte dromen daar werkt god
7691585 als ik thuiskom vertel ik het verhaal aan vijf anderen uit mijn dorp
7691586 het verhaal gaat over mijn vriend zijn vrouw wilde scheiden
7691587 mijn vriend vroeg mij uit te zoeken waarom de vrouw weg wilde ik liep verschillende keren van de vrouw naar mijn vriend de vrouw wilde weg want mijn vriend had de bruidschat niet betaald en leek daar ook niet toe over te willen gaan de vriend vertelde niets te hebben de vrouw geloofde daar niets van en vertrouwde haar echtgenoot niet meer toen ben ik zonder medeweten van mijn vriend naar zijn schoonfamilie gegaan
7691588 ik sprak met de tweede zoon die vertelde dat mijn vriend wel bezit had drie geiten terug bij mijn vriend confronteerde ik hem daarmee hij ontkende het niet en uit zichzelf zou hij ze niet gebracht hebben de schoonvader die ik later ook sprak samen met de tweede zoon wilde graag zijn tweede zoon naar de universiteit laten gaan schoonvader wilde daarom de drie geiten als bruidschat accepteren met die boodschap ben ik weer naar mijn vriend die onderwijzer is gegaan nu leek hij wel bereid we hebben de drie geiten naar de schoonfamilie gebracht zijn vrouw is niet weggegaan en het stel heeft nu vier kinderen
7691589 als een familie open is kunnen vader en moeder beide ook met hun kinderen overleggen en visa versa als dat ook in buurfamilies gebeurd is er meer opvang voor kinderen of voor mannen en vrouwen als een van de ouders afwezig is door werk ziekte of dood in een open familie kan je wat aan een ander overlaten dat is beter dan afhankelijk achterblijven
7691590 in een gesloten familie los je eerst de zaken samen op waarna je als eenheid naar buiten kunt treden en daarmee een goed voorbeeld kunt zijn
7691591 we hebben ze opgevangen de vluchtelingen uit rwanda en nu keren velen zich tegen onze bevolking dan hebben we liever dat ze teruggaan
7691592 het verhaal heeft een lange geschiedenis die terug gaat naar de periode van dekolonisatie het gaat hier over rwandese tutsis die in 1959 gevlucht waren voor geweld tegen hen die tutsis trokken naar uganda burundi tanzania en congo of werden intern verjaagd naar de droge provincie bugesera van rwanda veel tutsis uit tanzania van dezelfde vluchtperiode keerden na 1994 1995 terug naar rwanda en waren welkom in 1995 1996 trokken ook veel congolese 1959 tutsis terug naar rwanda die bleken niet meer welkom jullie hebben indertijd de congolese nationaliteit gekregen ga terug naar congo en maak daar wat van je leven dat was de boodschap van de nieuwe tutsi president kagame van rwanda
7691593 wij denken dat het toen niet verkrijgen van het ugandese staatsburgerschap een welkome aanleiding was niet de rede van hun terugkeer zoals door de franse journalist prunier wordt beschreven de rede was een andere
7691594 die tutsis hadden van de oude congolese guerrilla strijder en later president kabila de congolese nationaliteit gekregen kabila was in de vijftiger jaren kameraad en medestrijder van de toen vermoorde eerste gekozen zwarte president van congo lumumba kabila vroeg indertijd de medewerking ook van de tutsis in oost kivu bij de omverwerping van het bewind van mobutu in ruil beloofde hij als dank een goed woordje voor hen te doen bij kagame dat goede woordje zou bestaan uit het bewerkstelligen van terugkeer naar rwanda en het verkrijgen van goede posities de hulp kwam en kabilas belofte mislukte
7691595 ze worden in congo na het rwandese genocide drama niet goed genoeg beschermd vindt de congolese ex leger generaal nkunda hij heeft daarom met tutsis in oost congo een eigen legertje gevormd en heeft ze bewapend onder het motto als het congolese leger ons niet beschermt doen we het zelf dat is niet aanvaardbaar een staat in de staat is niet toegestaan
7691596 blijf in oost congo neem posities in en vestig geleidelijk dat rijk
7691597 kabila had steun nodig om de grondstoffen in oost congo te beschermen
7691598 er zijn nauwelijks winkels en de mensen doen wel zaken
7691599 we hadden wel veel problemen maar we bleven verbonden met elkaar
7691600 we zijn een organisatie die een steunende bijdrage wil gaan geven aan allerlei initiatieven die de korte vrede in deze regio moeten versterken onze mensen ontmoeten veel en gecompliceerde problemen als ze jonge en kleine initiatieven vol moeten houden we willen in ons werk graag de methode van sociotherapie inpassen daar hebben we via cordaid in nederland en de workshop in rwanda goede berichten over gehoord
7691601 er worden geen contracten gemaakt daar begint het conflict kan sociotherapie er een rol in spelen
7691602 het elektriciteitbedrijf brengt eens per 3 maanden de rekening zelf bij de mensen en de levering wordt gestopt als betaling uitblijft
7691603 iemand een burger of een militair die zich tegen de wet verzet
7691604 we nodigen lokale leiders uit zich te verdiepen en te verstaan met de uitstotingsproblematiek van verkrachte vrouwen en kinderen die daaruit geboren worden
7691605 we verkrachten omdat dat ons heel erg sterk maakt om te vechten
7691606 we wonen in een paradijs we ambi ren het helemaal niet om naar het westen te gaan dit is ons land
7691607 daar wonen 8 miljoen mensen kinshasa was vroeger wel en sinds mobutus regiem niet meer over de weg bereikbaar
7691608 we koken voor ze zodat ze niet hoeven te denken
7691609 although current mortgage and credit markets continue to cause fluctuations in the financial sector the overall fiscal condition of federally insured credit unions remains stable
7691610 in addition first mortgage real estate loans grew by 10 1 percent from january through june 2008 illustrating that credit unions continue to meet their members mortgage loan needs
7691611 but each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey i come here tonight as a sister blessed with a brother who is my mentor my protector and my lifelong friend i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election and i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me my mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion and her intelligence reflected in my own daughters
7691612 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7691613 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7691614 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure theexperience of being the only woman at the judges table
7691615 withkara by her side paula finally has some back up and now thereis going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7691616 the benefits of the program accrued very quickly and are very large
7691617 when adults stop smoking you see immediate benefits in heart disease with impacts on cancer and lung diseases starting to appear a year or two later
7691618 we hadden dit soort zaken verwacht hier kunnen we van leren
7691619 we zijn met zn twaalven in de sociotherapiegroep begonnen en we zijn nu op onszelf nog steeds met twaalf
7691620 with the sociotherapy method i decolonised myself in this group we talked about the thoughts which colonised me for a long time i have rejected them and this is much better
7691621 het was erg moeilijk mezelf thuis te controleren omdat de situatie daar erg moeilijk is
7691622 ik droomde vaak dat ik degene die mij had verraden zou vermoorden als ik hem tegen zou komen
7691623 iemand van de andere kant van de wereld heeft interesse in ons getoond
7691624 my mother in law is causing me problems every day
7691625 we kregen alle eenzame studenten zonder ouders meteen in de eerste groep
7691626 de studenten willen inderdaad hun ouders terug en dat laten ze jullie op allerlei manieren weten
7691627 als je ze iets geeft voelt het voor hen alsof het een antwoord is
7691628 voor de volgende groep moeten er we er zelf op toezien welke studenten mee kunnen gaan doen u had in de training gezegd dat we niet met de zwaarste problemen moesten beginnen dat is deze keer wel gebeurd
7691629 deze ervaring heeft mij in het bijzijn van deze studenten sterk gemaakt
7691630 als ieder van jullie in het weekend een persoonlijke afscheidskaart voor de studenten zou kunnen maken
7691631 dit gesprek was voor mij heel belangrijk nu weet ik beter hoe ik de ervaring kan begrijpen ik dacht dat we het niet goed konden zo is het niet
7691632 mijn gezondheid laat me een beetje in de steek ik ben ook niet meer zo jong ik heb kinderen verloren met de twee die er nog zijn heb ik problemen bij de een heb ik weinig gezag die luistert niet goed en toont weinig respect die gaat zijn eigen gang en is vaak niet thuis de ander wil geen water en stookhout voor me brengen dat is mijn probleem andere kinderen doen dat wel voor hun ouders jullie helpen me nu met water en stookhout dat is heel fijn toch schaam ik me voor mijn kinderen en ik weet niet hoe ik verandering kan maken
7691633 we moeten allemaal dezelfde boodschap uitzenden zodat kinderen begrijpen wat wel en niet goed is
7691634 soms hebben kinderen moeilijkheden omdat het op school niet lukt ik heb ontdekt dat het meisje dat het op school niet zo goed kon thuis heel goed wist wat ze moest doen ze kon sommige moeilijke situaties heel goed oplossen we moeten goed kijken wat kinderen kunnen en dan moeten we ze laten doen waar ze goed in zijn
7691635 ik ken een vrouw ze was tweede echtgenote die de was niet wilde doen voor haar man ze voelde zich niet goed behandeld door hem de man klaagde over haar en de was die ze niet wilde doen bij mij ik ben naar de rivier gegaan en heb op een respectvolle manier bemiddeld die vrouw en ik hebben daarna die was samen gedaan en nu is er weer een goede relatie
7691636 we moeten ervoor gaan zitten de tijd nemen en goed luisteren als er problemen zijn als we goed luisteren kunnen we problemen voorkomen
7691637 we moeten geen gehoorzaamheid verwachten zonder respect respect is voor iedereen heel belangrijk dat heb ik hier geleerd
7691638 u heeft geproken over de opvoeding van kinderen dat is iets wat alle volwassenen op de wereld doen u bent in deze sociotherapiegroep samengekomen omdat er zo veel gebeurd is waar u nog last van heeft het is begrijpelijk opmerkelijk en fijn dat u toch over de heel gewone dingen van het leven heeft gesproken juist die zijn zo belangrijk heb ik u goed begrepen dat u via een gesprek over de opvoeding van kinderen tegelijk praat over het belang uw betrokkenheid en uw bijdrage aan het herstel van respect in uw samenleving
7691639 sociotherapy is respect togetherness love and a new family ik heb negen kinderen verloren een leeft nog die is ergens in het buitenland ik weet niet waar ik ben alleen achtergebleven ik sprak met bijna niemand meer en kwam nergens door de sociotherapie groep heb ik geleerd dat ik mijn situatie moet accepteren zoals die nu is en dat ik me niet meer moet isoleren deze vrouwen zijn mijn nieuwe familie
7691640 ik kan niet slapen ik was van plan mezelf dood te maken ik isoleerde mezelf ik heb kinderen verloren mijn man was niet goed voor mij nu heb ik dit gekregen dat is heel belangrijk
7691641 hoe kunnen we nu hulp geven met lege handen de mensen hebben honger
7691642 jullie denken dat de mensen niet komen als er geen eten of geld wordt gegeven hoe zit het dan op de zondagen als mensen uren in de kerk zitten krijgen ze daarvoor eten en geld
7691643 donoren brachten direct na de genocide veel geld en de mensen denken dat er nog steeds veel geld wordt gegeven daar moeten we vanaf als er voedsel en vervangend inkomen aan sociotherapie deelnemers uitgedeeld gaat worden betekend dat het einde van dit project
7691644 i will purchase the game online and if i attempt to install it several times and find that i cannot do so i will simply download another copy using bittorrent

7691648 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7691649 the chances that it a new u n scheme to slow deforestation will go ahead in my mind are much higher
7691650 what i saw and heard in our debates on sectoral actions and approaches was a very fruitful debate
7691651 estamos vendo como o carnaval de notting hill est se tornando ano a ano um acontecimento internacional
7691652 n o h nada como este som o aroma da deliciosa comida caribenha e o colorido das fantasias
7691653 i think the market is going to be very quiet with theby election
7691654 what shall be done for the man who kills this philistine and takes away the reproach from israel for who is this uncircumcised philistine that he should defy the armies of the living god

7691665 you can lower a lot of class sizes with that money or buy a lot of supplies
7691666 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7691667 dime de que presumes y r stale 10 cent metros
7691668 we are not so frightened of the oil coming up from a blow out we are more frightened of the seismic it is something that is out of sight out of mind
7691669 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7691670 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7691671 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7691672 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7691673 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

7691677 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7691678 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7691679 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7691680 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7691681 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7691682 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7691683 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7691684 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7691685 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7691686 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7691687 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7691688 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7691689 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7691690 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7691691 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7691692 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7691693 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7691694 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7691695 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7691696 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7691697 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7691698 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7691699 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7691700 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7691701 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7691702 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7691703 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7691704 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7691705 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7691706 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7691707 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7691708 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7691709 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7691710 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7691711 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7691712 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7691713 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7691714 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7691715 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7691716 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7691717 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7691718 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7691719 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7691720 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7691721 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7691722 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7691723 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7691724 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7691725 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7691726 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7691727 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7691728 who are open to doing something on the production side
7691729 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7691730 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7691731 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7691732 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7691733 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7691734 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7691735 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7691736 there are times in the history of our nation when our very way of life depends upon dispelling illusions and awakening to the challenge of a present danger in such moments we are called upon to move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes those who for whatever reason refuse to do their part must either be persuaded to join the effort or asked to step aside this is such a moment the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk and even more if more should be required the future of human civilization is at stake i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates jobs are being outsourced home mortgages are in trouble banks automobile companies and other institutions we depend upon are under growing pressure distinguished senior business leaders are telling us that this is just the beginning unless we find the courage to make some major changes quickly the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted scientists with access to data from navy submarines traversing underneath the north polar ice cap have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months this will further increase the melting pressure on greenland according to experts the jakobshavn glacier one of greenlands largest is moving at a faster rate than ever before losing 20 million tons of ice every day equivalent to the amount of water used every year by the residents of new york city two major studies from military intelligence experts have warned our leaders about the dangerous national security implications of the climate crisis including the possibility of hundreds of millions of climate refugees destabilizing nations around the world and by the way our weather sure is getting strange isnt it there seem to be more tornadoes than in living memory longer droughts bigger downpours and record floods unprecedented fires are burning in california and elsewhere in the american west higher temperatures lead to drier vegetation that makes kindling for mega fires of the kind that have been raging in canada greece russia china south america australia and africa scientists in the department of geophysics and planetary science at tel aviv university tell us that for every one degree increase in temperature lightning strikes will go up another 10 percent and it is lightning after all that is principally responsible for igniting the conflagration in california today like a lot of people it seems to me that all these problems are bigger than any of the solutions that have thus far been proposed for them and thats been worrying me im convinced that one reason weve seemed paralyzed in the face of these crises is our tendency to offer old solutions to each crisis separately without taking the others into account and these outdated proposals have not only been ineffective they almost always make the other crises even worse yet when we look at all three of these seemingly intractable challenges at the same time we can see the common thread running through them deeply ironic in its simplicity our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change but if we grab hold of that common thread and pull it hard all of these complex problems begin to unravel and we will find that were holding the answer to all of them right in our hand the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses but to make this exciting potential a reality and truly solve our nations problems we need a new start thats why im proposing today a strategic initiative designed to free us from the crises that are holding us down and to regain control of our own destiny its not the only thing we need to do but this strategic challenge is the lynchpin of a bold new strategy needed to re power america today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen to those who say 10 years is not enough time i respectfully ask them to consider what the worlds scientists are telling us about the risks we face if we dont act in 10 years the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis when the use of oil and coal goes up pollution goes up when the use of solar wind and geothermal increases pollution comes down we must now lift our nation to reach another goal that will change history our entire civilization depends upon us now embarking on a new journey of exploration and discovery our success depends on our willingness as a people to undertake this journey and to complete it within 10 years once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
7691737 the 335i could have been a supercar a decade ago but the new m3 puts it in the shade weve made this point before but its an amazing commentary on the automotive world in which we live that a bmw m3 could pack a v 8 that generates upwards of 400 horsepower and still be considered a little underpowered i have a hunch that in a decade when were all driving gas misers well think back to this era with reverence and awe
7691738 when are you going to settle down and make some babies
7691739 you must realize that if you arent managing your own professional image someone else is people are constantly observing your behavior and forming theories about your competence character and commitment which are rapidly disseminated throughout your workplace it is only wise to add your voice in framing others theories about who you are and what you can accomplish
7691740 the road ahead will be tough but we can do it

7691743 i dont have a recipe exactly but it was a bunch of red potatoes like 10 or so chopped up and boiled for a while then put in a bowl with chopped up cream cheese 1 package i diced some onions and cooked them in butter and cut up some cherry tomatoes and dumped them all in together thats it

7691746 im glad to see people are still coming to barkerville
7691747 this reflects that more people in northern b c are taking stay cations in their own region barkerville is just far enough away and the cultural experience is different enough that they can have the impression of having taken a vacation to a distant place without having to drive that far
7691748 however it all balances out in the end when labour day can be on the 6th or 7th in other years

7691762 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7691763 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7691764 hes still manipulating me hes still controlling me financially he has cut off my mobile phone my home phone my electricity
7691765 i believe yeah an element of him does love me but unfortunately it was like living with maybe dr jekyl and mr hyde and just who was going to win out on the day
7691766 everything shes said is totally false and thats how it is
7691767 i sent her the letter and asked if shed like the tickets to take my son to the circus for his birthday she said yes then the next thing i know shes organised to have me arrested when i dropped them off to school for breaching the avo
7691768 physical violence pushing and shoving and verbal abuse constant verbal abuse
7691769 i was told that i was worthless that i was useless comments about my physical appearance that my intelligence was questioned
7691770 items would go flying if i was reading a book he would grab it and chuck it out into the garden he would empty my wardrobe contents into the driveway
7691771 no i dont want to hurt him i just want to be able to get on with my life
7691772 im after what anyone feels that theyre entitled to so that i can go away and start again
7691773 really sad about what shes said and sad for my children my daughter was with me when that promo came on and she just cried her eyes out i just dont want that
7691774 were just going to tell that all in court im not into doing tit for tat i want to be dignified
7691775 im trying to go on and keep my business together
7691776 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7691777 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7691778 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7691779 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7691780 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7691781 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7691782 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7691783 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7691784 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7691785 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7691786 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7691787 our party and our country has been strengthened by her candidacy
7691788 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7691789 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7691790 because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them

7691799 anas ive learnt so much today i think what the faci said was right
7691800 o allah please give us guidance to the right path until our death ameen
7691801 anas dont be sad you could always take whats right and throw away whats wrong buanglah yg keruh dan ambillah yg jernih
7691802 owh thank you there might be some right things anyway
7691803 enchek faci kata kalau takdak negara agama tak diturunkan siap gune contoh agama islam lagi tapi entahle
7691804 erm bukan ker agama islam tertegak dulu baru negara madinah muncul agama dimulakan dengan akidah yg kuat syariat yang terzahir diiringi dengan akhlak yg mulia diselaputi kukuh bergandingan dengan kuasa politik jualah antaranya menebarkan layaran islam di bumi allah
7691805 but indeed the answer given by the facilitator as a conclusion was that negara should be the first priority in our life
7691806 erm kalo cik faci datang oz dah lama kena tego tau there is no right for you to impose directly whatever people should be though jangan ingat cik faci berumur lebih sedikit berbanding kami x semestinya idea itu betul yg semua kebaikan dan buah fikiran yang halus mulus datang daripada yang maha tinggi harus kita rai sebaiknya kesimpulan itu dibuat pertukaran idea bukannya sudah pun nak kata okla terima kasih atas semua pandangan yg diberikan tidak kiralah prioriti apapun yg saudara saudari lakukan bagi meraikan non muslim kena beringat jugak bukan tak boleh kita nak pertahan islam directly but when it comes to implementation in terms of delivering points to them we have to practice modesty wisdom and clarity so any misunderstandings can be avoided or at least prevented before any bad consequences spread over pastikan ia dibuat atas landasan kebaikan keadilan dan keharmonian semata mata untuk mencapai keamanan dan rasa mesra antara setiap satu penduduk dunia niat perlu baik cara pun mesti seiiring mahu wujud keamanan tetapi kalo caranya dengan membunuh orang tanpa sebab itu tidak diterima cara nampak mesra tapi niat nak jaga kepentingan diri pun tidak kena juga so we have to seek balance within both spectrums
7691807 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama

7691834 these are not licensed as required by u s federal law and theyre the prime source of cigarettes that are smuggled into canada and if the reverse was occurring and there was widespread contraband in the u s originating from canada the u s government would insist that the canadian government take action
7691835 were very concerned that the decline in smoking rates has now stopped
7691836 and the reason for that in our view is the widespread contraband problem that is providing access to inexpensive cigarettes and that is impeding governments from increasing tobacco taxes

7691857 the three warnings about serious adverse events associated with use of atypical antipsychotic agents in elderly people with dementia had a limited effect on the prescription rates of these agents
7691858 we also found that the overall rates of use of these drugs actually increased between the first warning in 2002 and the end of our follow up in 2007
7691859 this finding highlights the limited impact of warnings and suggests that more effective approaches are needed to protect vulnerable populations from potentially hazardous medications
7691860 health care warnings should provide accurate explicit and complete information about the risks and efficacy of the identified treatment in addition to providing the same information on alternative treatments

7691913 cher is nolans first choice to play catwoman he wants to portray her like a vamp in her twilight years the new catwoman will be the absolute opposite of michelle pfeiffer and halle berrys creations
7691914 i believe my wife to be very creative and there seems to be no end to the desire to be creative i find that invigorating and interesting we have conversations some deep some shallow we are all philosophers its impossible to live life and not be a philosopher its just that some people have thought about some things more than others
7691915 i would say yes as long as it never gets in the way of the show it would be great to see it at the cinema its been there before so it would be good to see it again
7691916 a movie is 90 minutes thats not that different from making a single episode so im not against it
7691917 we have had an e mail complaining about the teepees and asking if they require permission
7691918 our investigating officer will visit as soon as possible to establish exactly what the situation is
7691919 i really dont know the answer at this stage because it is perfectly legal for example to put up a marquee in your back garden for a wedding
7691920 this is a devastating split everyone thought their relationship was rock solid but diana wants nothing more to do with him
7691921 she has now been given a compliance date of 20 september to have the structure removed

7691929 she hasnt cried once except for a second when they pulled her out we have now felt a new kind of love and joy that we never knew existed
7691930 the best thing about bernie is that he was happiest when the people around him were happy thats a real testament to the kind of generosity that he had
7691931 i did his show and my character had all of the laugh lines and i had all of the flashy things to do and i said hey bernie is this cool
7691932 i think thats a real testament to who bernie was he shined when everybody else shined he was really generous
7691933 grabbed her tank top and bra and pulled them down and exposed her breasts
7691934 we found that his actions were more in line with an assault than a sexual battery it didnt appear to be an overt sexual act
7691935 that never made sense to me even if george w bush was telling the truth about weapons of mass destruction in fact particularly if he was telling the truth about weapons of mass destruction why the hell would you bomb a country that could fire back that would be insane
7691936 bush did real damage to americas reputation around the world
7691937 you cant have the government determining how long people are imprisoned for thats the job of the courts habeas corpus a suspects right to a court hearing is a right that goes back to the magna carta and governments cant infringe upon that
7691938 we do not discuss individual benefits cases but we can confirm that all resident local families with young children are eligible for certain benefits
7691939 at first i said no to oliver i gave him names of other actors i was afraid to do it

7691949 i have to wear heels all day long today and if you saw my room it looks like a murder scene with all the blood everywhere
7691950 they ferrell and his wife bring an instant awareness to the charity that we probably couldnt have achieved on our own in life people can choose to be charitable with their time or their money will and viveca have been extremely generous to cancer for college with both

7691953 ive had many people over the years that have opposed me and you know what they end up being my best friend lets see what happens
7691954 david has been round at toms house a lot while katie and victoria have been swapping fashion tips on the phone david has been advising tom on diet
7691955 tom has a private gym at his home and david has been working out with him he also gave him diet advice tom has been sticking to 1 200 calories a day mostly grilled chicken and fish with lots of vegetables salads and fruit
7691956 david put together a work out regime that included the treadmill weight training and fencing lessons together
7691957 tom had been steadily gaining weight he didnt notice it at first but then he developed quite a paunch he hated it when pictures started appearing of him with a belly and love handles
7691958 he turned 46 this summer and hes got a 29 year old wife and a young family so he wanted to get back in shape
7691959 it was blown way out of proportion by a sheriff who wanted his 15 minutes of fame my family is wonderful so very happy were all great
7691960 my kids are by no means ready to watch this 90210
7691961 were not a mom and dad who are home eating bon bons its a couple whos f king
7691962 well clear the kitchen so fast to have sex you dont know what to do with yourself
7691963 hes awesome in the film i saw it a week before he passed i was talking to his manager who said he never got a chance to see it
7691964 thats a tragedy because its one of the best things hes ever done its the bernie we know and its the bernie we love
7691965 bernie was thinner because hed been sick off and on for a while so he wasnt that american football looking guy that i used to know
7691966 funny enough that story was fake but i just found out i am pregnant
7691967 shes the best stepmom sam lola and cassandra could ever hope for seeing her love and affection with those three i know she ll be an amazing mom
7691968 unless i bat 100 per cent perhaps a boy awaits us
7691969 there is almost a contempt for success in the national character a lampooning of celebrity a tradition of putting it down
7691970 but just when you think theyre ignoring you to the point of disdain the government and the queen suddenly say actually we rather like you and give you a knighthood its the most delicious and wonderful balance which happens nowhere else in the world
7691971 i think its great being less famous i blame the fact i had shall we say a meeting with russell crowe
7691972 i had never seen or heard such bad press about me here and its been great in a funny kind of way and you know a good thing too because i now realise the world does not revolve around me
7691973 i woke up alone the next morning pain all around my groin and lower abdomen i started to whimper like a whipped dog so this is what syphilis is like i thought i suppose i deserve it but christ how the hell was i to know
7691974 it began to sink in shatner my understudy would have to go on it instantly brought back the pain i screamed for a nurse who jabbed me with more morphine
7691975 i knew then that the sob son of a b ch was going to be a star
7691976 ms bynes was driving a bmw when she made an unsafe turn and another car hit her
7691977 it was determined that she was at fault but no crime was committed the other driver complained of minor injuries
7691978 drugs and alcohol were not involved it was just a typical car accident there was no serious damage to either vehicle
7691979 i am taking legal action as its so silly i know young girls look up to me and you know i am a mother of three how and why would i put my health in any situation like that its totally without foundation
7691980 i was a mess in some ways and that had nothing to do with my choice of career
7691981 i was the luckiest girl in the world when i got the princess diaries films but all the driven behaviour that you need to be successful as a teenager didnt help me when it came to my private life and social situations
7691982 so going to university helped me a lot i used to worry too much and take myself too seriously
7691983 i wrote that song no 1 fan as a stalker it was raining and i was sitting there in front of the house watching her come home from a date after we were divorced
7691984 i was imagining what she did on this date and watching her giving him a kiss i went home and wrote this song
7691985 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
7691986 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7691987 we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter
7691988 i dont know how to say it shes a lovely lovely girl we had a spell of something that is over now but were on good terms
7691989 im going to get asked about this arent i i though it was just between me and her
7691990 im so so excited the books really intrigued me when i was little and ive always loved the story i really love burton films edward scissorhands and big fish
7691991 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7691992 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7691993 yeah i went to a few sex addiction meetings but ive had my own history ive been to prostitutes and massage parlours and stuff back in the old days so i understand the mindset a little
7691994 the queen arrived she made her way along the line up she shook hands with me had a few words and moved straight on past tony her eyes did not rest on him she by passed him totally never mess around with the queen is the moral here
7691995 he doesnt rep lindsay or blake and no one knows who the creep is
7691996 the count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish and i fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken this with some cheese and a salad and a bottle of old tokay of which i had two glasses was my supper during the time i was eating it the count asked me many questions as to my journey and i told him by degrees all i had experienced
7691997 now i call that kind and brotherly of you said the sea rat i was indeed hungry when i sat down and ever since i inadvertently happened to mention shell fish my pangs have been extreme but couldnt you fetch it along out here i am none too fond of going under hatches unless im obliged to and then while we eat i could tell you more concerning my voyages and the pleasant life i lead at least it is very pleasant to me and by your attention i judge it commends itself to you whereas if we go indoors it is a hundred to one that i shall presently fall asleep that is indeed an excellent suggestion said the water rat and hurried off home there he got out the luncheon basket and packed a simple meal in which remembering the strangers origin and preferences he took care to include a yard of long french bread a sausage out of which the garlic sang some cheese which lay down and cried and a long necked straw covered flask wherein lay bottled sunshine shed and garnered on far southern slopes thus laden he returned with all speed and blushed for pleasure at the old seamans commendations of his taste and judgment as together they unpacked the basket and laid out the contents on the grass by the roadside
7691998 something appeared in her line of vision the white lily on the tray take it he said i want to give it to you she stared at him she did not take the flower but she felt her face rearrange itself in a very strange way and realized as he smiled she was smiling
7691999 to be alone out of choice is one thing even women who fear the permanency of that state may long for the solitude it offers and welcome its repose but to be alone out of necessity is another story and a sad one at that limp with the draining energy of shame and fear
7692000 being alone and free of our usual distractions can actually feel dangerous calling up our unconscious doubts and fears that we are
7692001 we will also discover that aloneness doesnt negate our need for relationships any more than relationships negate our need for aloneness we need both
7692002 the message is clear enough to be alone is to be at fault and unworthy of the company of others
7692003 the subject of what we could or would do on our own just doesnt excite our interest we much prefer to wonder what we did wrong and whether there will be a next time
7692004 for among the species of aloneness one of the most painful to endure is to be in the presence of someone who arouses a need but does not satisfy it
7692005 many of us believe that we are less than we pretend to be
7692006 when we fall in love we almost forget we are distinct individuals as if we exist only in relationship with another person
7692007 but in all relationships it eventually comes to pass that two people anxiously trying to merge into one discover they are really two
7692008 the real fear however is to be with ones self and to avoid that confrontation the desire to be with someone sometimes anyone can take on an urgency verging on obsession
7692009 the feeling of shame women alone carry always revolves around the theme of not being good enough as we are nothing undermines a womans self esteem more quickly than to feel judged
7692010 this is not to suggest that the awareness of being alone is our constant preoccupation
7692011 aligned with this toxic form of self blame is the fear of being thought of and worse seeing ourselves as
7692012 it is little wonder that women continue to be confused about their roles and their identity the medias subliminal message to us is that everything we do must be calculated to make us desirable to a man
7692013 flight centre starts the new financial year with significant momentum from 2007 08 a strong balance sheet and with foundations in place for further growth acting chief executive shannon obrien said
7692014 while we do not expect to replicate the 30 per cent to 40 per cent increases we have achieved in each of the past two years we will be disappointed if we do not increase pre tax profit by 10 to 15 per cent
7692015 flight centre continues to increase its scale in all countries while also developing a broader foundation mr obrien said
7692016 in addition to being one of the worlds leading leisure travel providers the company is now a significant and emerging presence in global corporate and wholesale travel
7692017 we see our diversity of both brands and geography as a platform for the future and a real strength
7692018 there were studies into whether cats and guinea pigs can be infected this was done when the original outbreak occurred in 1994
7692019 we did a survey of bat carers and tested them and none showed any exposure to the hendra virus
7692020 bats wont be culled they are a protected species and are an important part of the ecosystem
7692021 we are far better looking at how horses catch the virus
7692022 we are studying how the virus travels in bat populations and how it is related to the reproductive cycle
7692023 it would mean for example in this current financial year a surplus of 20 billion instead of 21 5 billion
7692024 lets not be lectured by the labor party about fiscal rectitude they have nothing to tell us
7692025 they certainly dont have a mandate for these completely unjustifiable tax increases
7692026 what the government is actually doing is taxing australians now in an unjustifiable way in order to spend it later in order to buy their way back into office in 2010
7692027 the july number that we just have hot off the press our internal inflation number in supermarkets in australia was 2 5 per cent mr luscombe said today
7692028 so its dropped mainly on the basis of extreme deflation in produce at the moment
7692029 whilst we are pleased with the momentum in the business we are mindful that discretionary spending continues to be influenced by macro economic factors such as inflation fluctuating petrol prices interest rates and lower consumer confidence levels it said
7692030 this investment continues to deliver gains in market share he said
7692031 australian food and liquor continues to perform well and big w petrol and consumer electronics have had a good start to the new financial year
7692032 new zealand supermarkets has experienced tight trading conditions as in the fourth quarter it said
7692033 our current focus is to maintain a capital structure that will preserve our capital strength and give us the flexibility to pursue further growth opportunities
7692034 our balance sheet debt profile and strength of our credit ratings ensure we are very well placed for future growth both organically and through acquisition
7692035 any international expansion would have full oversight from the board be undertaken in a prudent and disciplined fashion and meet the hurdles required for all our capital investment decisions it said
7692036 ohhh lawd irys done went and got a tattoo on her back lord save her
7692037 but um family member number 1 you sleeping with a married man and um family member number 2 you had chirren outta wedlock and ma grandma um didnt you used to go to jail every weekend for raising hell at the try me cafe and shooting folks

7692039 girl sit yo fast narrow ass down somewhere and hush try me if you want to
7692040 since the early days of sonic pulsar portugals hugo floress output has been prolific and impressive and factory of dreams is his latest project poles should find a wide audience as it slots neatly into the genre originally created by the gathering and since enriched by luminaries such as within temptation nightwish edenbridge lacuna coil after forever and epica et al it is goth metal though the metal label is used lightly fronted by the rich soprano of swedens jessica lehto electric boom
7692041 a lot went into this album and it is easy to hear that factory of dreams tuned each track to near perfection
7692042 40 year old cuddly bear who is looking for a buddy friend for fun
7692043 put simply financial returns from wine have not met our expectations acting chief executive ian johnston said today
7692044 global trading conditions for wine continue to be competitive but the category remains in solid growth mr johnston said
7692045 we have not been immune from industry wide pressures including an economic slow down in key markets and higher grape prices
7692046 we are making good progress with our wine review but wont be commenting on our analysis or conclusions until the review is completed
7692047 vb remains australias favourite beer with the healthy growth of vb gold returning the brand to overall growth
7692048 we expect the beer market to remain resilient with brand innovation driving value growth
7692049 some very deliberate pricing decisions have slowed beer volume growth but strong value growth continues mr johnston said
7692050 the fur industry wants the public to believe that most of the mink liberated are recaptured or killed after being freed but this is not the case and i would argue that even if some are recaptured at least they have been given a chance at what everyone deserves a chance to live free
7692051 contrary to the rhetoric of those who profit from the imprisonment and killing of these beautiful wild creatures scientific studies have proven captive mink have the innate ability to survive in the wild do not decimate other animal populations or the environment and do not carry away small children or pets
7692052 when a person places the proper value on freedom there is nothing under the sun that she will not do to acquire that freedom

7692071 our words our thoughts and our feelings all contribute to the creation of our reality our word is a two edged sword it can create or it can destroy to be impeccable is to create with conscious awareness and love ruiz also makes the point that our perceptions of others are merely reflections of ourselves therefore to put another down or project negative words or energy towards another person is to lash out at the other person because of our own insecurities the human mind is fertile ground for the seeds that are our word so plant the seeds of love not fear judging blaming shaming and especially gossiping create poison in ourselves and others this agreement alone is enough to break all of your old agreements and change the dream of your life
7692072 there is an awful lot of negative energy out there and some of it is directed at us by other people but other peoples reactions and opinions are simply other peoples reactions and opinions they are having their own experience and none of it has anything to do with you it does not make you wrong guilty bad unworthy famous loveable or important if you take it personally and take on the poison of anothers words it becomes a very negative agreement you have with yourself what anybody thinks about you or says about you is really about them not taking it personally allows you to be in relationship with anyone and not get trapped in their stuff this agreement can also pertain to things that we take personally that cause us to go into upset
7692073 your best changes from moment to moment sick or well tired or rested
7692074 judging blaming shaming creates poison in ourselves and in others
7692075 ive a prize for each and every one of you so just be patient

7692080 the image of featureless steel structures catastrophically crumbling into a fatal dust storm was indelibly imprinted on the minds of millions of people around the world
7692081 i think galicias death made everyone in the county aware that as we transform from a rural community to a more suburban and urbanized county the places where you could shoot safely in the past are not there anymore
7692082 none of that is a substitute in my opinion for a smart shooting regulation that limits the ability to shoot on these quarter acre lots
7692083 so you have to find an apartment at the end of the month and itll be a big hassle what else is happening
7692084 its not going to be short and swift but its begun nonetheless

7692090 one of on our goals was to increase the exposure nationally about football and this allows us to do that
7692091 were going to work hard to do that and this is the first step in that direction
7692092 were pretty set with the starters but its just how many are going to rotate how many guys are going to roll in and out whos deserving playing time and how much
7692093 those are some of the answers we have to have
7692094 were going to roll running backs tailbacks for sure fullback probably some maybe not as much wide receivers weve got to keep them fresh
7692095 it was not his call but hes out of the green right now no limitations
7692096 swing gracefully from my prison climb down the trees branches and land triumphantly on the forest floor

7692100 im so grateful that barkley gets to have the surgery and enjoy his retirement
7692101 i just hope this improves his quality of life and theres a successful recovery for him
7692102 in barkleys case this is a surgery of last resort either live with his condition or be euthanized and hopefully its not too late
7692103 i wanted to do community organizing and i couldnt think of a better city than one as energized and hopeful as chicago was then
7692104 i was asking around among community activists in chicago and around the country and they kept mentioning him
7692105 the black community in this city had not been so energized and so single minded since chicago mayor harold washington died
7692106 we were registering hundreds a day and we werent having to search them out they came looking for us african americans were just so eager to have a say again to feel they counted

7692111 macharski emboldened by the felicitous election of ratzinger jumps the gun and announces gaudium magnum annuntio urbi orbi et universo
7692112 if that were the case i would find it very disappointing
7692113 there you go again thats the same politics of division that has gotten us where we are
7692114 john mccain makes fun of the fact that people are coming out all over this country to hear what i have to say and to talk with me about their lives their concerns and their dreams but he doesnt seem to get that theres a reason no ones listening to him because theyve been hearing the same party line for 8 years and theyve seen where its taken us if john mccain wants to draw some crowds of his own perhaps he should stop filtering out everyone who isnt already his supporter and try listening to people who may not agree with all his solutions
7692115 the political brain the role of emotion in deciding the fate of the nation
7692116 if were really going to move the needle to encourage people to change their commuting habits it seems to me its less about building trails and lanes to far flung
7692117 all those things they want to implement that would make it so much nicer said warren jenkins who rides his single speed green schwinn from downtown to his job at recycle bookstore on the alameda
7692118 the way things are going with cars and gasoline prices human power is going to be a lot more prominent its part of the solution right
7692119 bike share program similar to token operated luggage carts at airports would allow commuters to use a token or credit card to borrow bikes from a light rail station to get to work then return it when they get on the train home
7692120 every year were seeing more people get on their bikes she said
7692121 whats happening is that the transit facilities were built to handle a certain number of riders the demand is surpassing that
7692122 largely uptapped federal funding as well as valley transportation authority money to build the network of barricaded bike lanes
7692123 the cost will depend on how many corridors we identify and for how many miles
7692124 thou shalt gt not mix different implementations of the standard c library
7692125 for the average joe blow out there in the community if you actually provide false testimony deliberately then that is perjury why should parliament be any different
7692126 the privileges committee has the ability to impose punishments including fines and those that dont pay those finds can be jailed
7692127 each member of this expedition had seen the world as it is and had a vision of what it could be in a small way through their selfless actions
7692128 we offer our sincere condolences to the families and friends of all who lost their lives or their family in this tragic event
7692129 it seems like the pilot tried her best to make a safe landing in an open field but was not successful
7692130 nationwide its too new for us to go from a slap on the wrist to the death penalty
7692131 there had to be an intermediate step and thats what weve chosen here
7692132 it was kind of like if you foul a guy under the basket you get thrown out of the game
7692133 were proud of it and were going to live by it
7692134 all disciplinary agreements approved by the commission are expected to be carried out by all parties and mr biancone is no exception
7692135 google earth is perfect for this kind of research because the animals are undisturbed by the observer
7692136 our first idea was to study sleeping directions of humans e g when doing camping but there are too many constraints
7692137 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7692138 the benefits of the program accrued very quickly and are very large
7692139 when adults stop smoking you see immediate benefits in heart disease with impacts on cancer and lung diseases starting to appear a year or two later
7692140 show the desperate level al qaida has reached with members of one family driving each other to death
7692141 we know that isolation is significant because the russians have complained about it for over a decade
7692142 the west has treated russia like an object and not a player russia has sought to be at the table so now the west faces a catch 22 we can threaten russias exclusion from the international community but that threat is one of the main causes of russias anger
7692143 the big minus is something we previously suspected but now know for sure that russia is completely alone the notion of strategic solitude has been discussed in our academic journals for some time but now its clear that russia finds itself without any sympathy in the world
7692144 i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7692145 i never dreamed i would walk again after i was wounded i forgot what its like
7692146 only when standing up can i feel how tall i really am and speak to people eye to eye not from below
7692147 it raises people out of their wheelchair and lets them stand up straight
7692148 physically the body works differently when upright you can challenge different muscles and allow full expansion of the lungs
7692149 psychologically it lets people live at the upright level and make eye contact
7692150 it may be a burdensome device but it will be very helpful and important for those who choose to use it
7692151 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
7692152 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discreet charm
7692153 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case anymore
7692154 there is no doubt we are seeking peace and we are calling for the achievement of our national principles
7692155 there will be no peace without the release of all prisoners
7692156 i so need to win cuz im like the best momommy out there
7692157 you are a freak tamn a freak i love it oh and enter me in the giveaway ya freak
7692158 oh my heck i am so excited i can hardly see straight
7692159 sad i mean awesome i am so excited i dont know which exclamation to use
7692160 we just cant cop any more pressure its like a pressure cooker and its ready to bust at the seams
7692161 you know we have people that are turned away from the caloundra hospital and the noosa hospital and the gympie hospital and the nambour hospital on a regular basis
7692162 but then why didnt you stay out longer and catch more
7692163 but what do you do with the rest of your time
7692164 i sleep late fish a little play with my children and take a siesta with my wife in the evenings i go into the village to see my friends play guitar sing a few songs i have a full life
7692165 i have an mba from iim a and i can help you you should start by fishing longer every day you can then sell the extra fish you catch with the extra revenue you can buy a bigger boat
7692166 with the extra money the larger boat will bring you can buy a second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of trawlers instead of selling your fish to a middle man you can then negotiate directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant you can then leave this little village and move to panjim or even mumbai from there you can direct your huge new enterprise
7692167 afterwards well my friend thats when it gets really interesting
7692168 when your business gets really big you can start selling stocks and make millions
7692169 after that youll be able to retire live in a tiny village near the coast sleep late play with your children catch a few fish take a siesta with your wife and spend your evenings doing what you like with your buddies
7692170 with all due respect sir but thats exactly what i am doing now so whats the point wasting 25 years
7692171 theres been some studies apparently by previous governments of this i havent seen them which have said it may not work
7692172 but we want to have another look at it because its a positive constructive idea
7692173 we are seeing a growing trend of people in early alzheimers who really retain the capacity to contribute
7692174 these are the voices of our mothers fathers sisters and brothers husbands and wives and they are telling us that alzheimers is a significant but not insurmountable problem
7692175 alzheimers is like a monster under the bed you have two choices you can either look under the bed and scope out the monster and see what tools you have to fight him or you can sit there and wait for him to come theres so much you can do if you know early on
7692176 it will almost certainly be these early stage patients who will lead the way toward new drugs since they are poised to benefit from them
7692177 work toward a professional parliament that will represent the true wishes of the people of zimbabwe
7692178 the beginning of power sharing not by consensus but by issue of the electoral weight
7692179 it gives them a significant amount of power to build the legislative assembly into a strong force for accountability one which is really going to force the executive mugabe to find a way to work with a parliament which may be led by hostile forces
7692180 it would be illegal for anyone to be arrested while they were proceeding to parliament
7692181 zanu pf are in a desperate attempt to try and stop or abort our victory
7692182 if research is seen as petty and partisan and a tactical weapon in political battles its capacity to convince the convincible may be tragically undermined
7692183 weve scoured the globe to find the most innovative and groundbreaking cinematographers writers producers and directors this years line up will feature a gathering of professionals at the top of their game ready and willing to share their expertise and experience
7692184 if youre just going along like a hamster in a wheel then youve lost the pure white heat that makes this business so much fun and it should be challenging thats what separates the great agents from the good agents
7692185 by 2020 we might have nine billion people on the planet we could have a very big middle class driving millions more cars and we could be in a really resource hungry world with the oil price climbing and a supply situation in libya russia and saudi where natural gas is limited
7692186 it is those drivers those conditions which will encourage the possibility of landfill mining
7692187 its never a lack of resources that limit you its only a lack of resourcefulness
7692188 two of the men had tattoos and jewelry popular with white supremacists
7692189 a knowing and willful attempt to violate the strictures of federal election law
7692190 an investigation of the american issues project its officers and directors and its anonymous donors whoever they may be
7692191 this is a sad ploy to circumvent the first amendment by a campaign who has no arguments with the merits of our ad its the classic maneuver if you cant win on the merits file a lawsuit
7692192 an appalling lie a disgraceful smear of the lowest kind on the senators patriotism and commitment to the rule of law
7692193 is inconsistent with your stations obligations under federal communications commission regulations
7692194 obama supporters have now sent more than 93 000 e mails to the sinclair stations that have decided to run the ad
7692195 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
7692196 how much do your really know about barack obama what does he really believe
7692197 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
7692198 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7692199 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7692200 the fact that obama is launching his own convention by defending his long association with a man who says he didnt bomb enough u s targets tells us more about barack obama than any of tonights speeches will
7692201 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
7692202 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
7692203 to feature photos and interviews by the finest young image makers today verve is a reminder of the power of the still image verve will also point you to new photo agencies publications and inspiring multimedia projects
7692204 i will never have a career where i can bitch about how
7692205 i think this is a great place to get a little attention on what no child left behind is doing to our kids and to our teachers
7692206 i just slapped it together with some glue and put it on
7692207 the key to personal branding success is to define yourself instead of letting others define you
7692208 the pc age is giving way to a new era the utility age
7692209 computer systems are not at their core technologies of emancipation
7692210 they are technologies of control they were designed as tools for monitoring and influencing human behavior for controlling what people do and how they do it
7692211 we seem impelled to glide across the slick surface of data as we make our rushed passage from link to link
7692212 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
7692213 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
7692214 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
7692215 are so delicious in and of themselves its best not to dress them up with much
7692216 s nu m n nci cutare m ncare caci este p cat

7692219 i think this is a great place to get a little attention on what no child left behind is doing to our kids and to our teachers
7692220 i just slapped it together with some glue and put it on
7692221 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7692222 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7692223 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7692224 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7692225 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7692226 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7692227 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7692228 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7692229 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though
7692230 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7692231 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7692232 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7692233 pretendo agarrar essa chance e come ar bem fazendo tudo certinho estou subindo agora e espero mostrar um bom futebol diante da torcida
7692234 como o c ssio joga mais preso na marca o o elias jogar como j estamos acostumados apoiando um pouco mais na frente
7692235 in the livermore valley the smoke cleared quickly and did not accumulate the same weather patterns that bring the fog in from the bay also serve to clear the air of smoke thus there was imperceptible impact from the smoke
7692236 as for frost i saw my first frost damage in livermore in my 8 harvests here that too was minimal and the shoot tips grew through the frost and we have seen no yield or quality impact in our vineyards
7692237 in our monterey vineyards as in the livermore valley arroyo seco has windy afternoons which bring in cool air from the pacific clearing the air
7692238 our crews some of whom have more than 30 years experience provided exceptional management of the irrigation and farming of our estate vineyards my family and i are looking forward to this 125th harvest
7692239 no one has to know that im just a paper tiger living in a condo built on bullshit and sand
7692240 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
7692241 if you have a green party i want to join
7692242 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
7692243 if you have a green party i want to join
7692244 as far as wingnuts go dana is pretty goddamn well grounded
7692245 aw dont be dissin dana for a wingnut hes not half bad
7692246 sh t i like dana more than i like jesurgislac and dana is near pathological in his desire to throw people in jail hes a messed up monkey but i still feel his humanity despite some of the missing parts
7692247 a week without common sense political thought was making me feel lower than a snakes belly in a wagon rut
7692248 dana troglodyte misogynist obsessive a complete loser every time i pick on him no matter how nasty a person he is i feel bad because he is after all a loser
7692249 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
7692250 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
7692251 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
7692252 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
7692253 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
7692254 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
7692255 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
7692256 querida ni a rebelde chilena sandino era un hombre sencillo con poca educaci n escolar de un peque o pueblo de nicaragua que se rebel contra la ocupaci n militar yanqui que entonces hab a en su pa s
7692257 new book out and making the move to open access
7692258 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
7692259 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
7692260 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
7692261 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
7692262 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
7692263 until a motherly woman pushed through the crowd and picked it up
7692264 a m me encanta el entusiasmo con que pi era lleg de china pero se da una cosa lamentable la udi le quit el piso entonces qui n manda la pregunta es qui n manda
7692265 tenemos malas experiencias lamentablemente porque pi era quer a el voto de los chilenos en el exterior y sus parlamentarios le dijeron que no pi era dec a modifiquemos el binominal y los parlamentarios dijeron no a pi era le gustaba la inscripci n autom tica y el voto voluntario o no castigado y los parlamentarios le dijeron que no entonces estamos en una paradoja almonacid avanza pero nadie le hace caso ese es el problema
7692266 it scared a lot of people away it made our saturday a bust
7692267 we were determined to have a good time she says
7692268 you will find in these the tables for the planet herschel as far as the observations hitherto made you will see that herschel was the first astronomer who discovered it to be a planet
7692269 all human discoveries seem to be made only for the purpose of confirming more and more strongly the truths that come from on high and are contained in the sacred writings
7692270 from what ive seen so far this season it will be the same two at the top of the league again
7692271 arsenal and liverpool have the players to push united and chelsea hard but those two are just too strong at the moment they have too many options
7692272 im sure united will end up with berbatov and that will make a big difference for them it will give them another goal threat and another way of playing
7692273 their movement is something else and made it really difficult for us tonight to get into the game tevez in particular was excellent today a real handful
7692274 we were a decent team last season and will be a good one again this year
7692275 we have a few new players and they just need to learn how to play together but that will come
7692276 we are ready to accept any decisions up to halting relations altogether
7692277 we dont feel or see any advantages from membership if they exist at all
7692278 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7692279 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
7692280 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7692281 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7692282 we are going into the future what did i walk into a time capsule
7692283 democrats will leave this denver convention unified organized and stronger than ever to take america in a new direction with barack obama and joe biden as president and vice president
7692284 republicans say john mccain has experience we say john mccain has the experience of being wrong
7692285 when i went to beijing i left him for two weeks and it was heartbreaking not so much my husband but my son
7692286 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you youre always losing in the final its so great that you finally win something big
7692287 we got here thursday i really dont know what day it is any more i thought today was friday
7692288 in the first set i felt like i was playing against a wall
7692289 i still think federer is playing great tennis but the mindset of the other players has changed because hes lost more this year than he has in the past
7692290 it was the joy of it i didnt have the pressure of playing at wimbledon as an english player i could come here and get on with it
7692291 ok i get it we have to work together and we have to win in november
7692292 ive got to get a book by alan greenspan or read it this summer learn about the economy
7692293 lets fight somebody to invade or some way to use force
7692294 people want border security and to have laws enforced but they also understand there are people here working who are probably good for the economy
7692295 what if a politician were to see his or her job as that of an organizer as part teacher and part advocate one who does not sell voters short but who educates them about the real choices before them
7692296 we must form grass root structures that would hold me and other elected officials more accountable for their actions
7692297 a means to present a corrective image to the social and political trends and moral drives and spiritual needs of black people
7692298 watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof from the fateful day of our lunch tell tale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge
7692299 we are caught in the moment in the changes in the communications industry and the general downturn of the economy
7692300 if there is a book that you want to read that hasnt been written you must write it
7692301 everything everything everything everything everything i worry about things that have no relationship to me whatsoever
7692302 a dynamic proxy class is a class that implements a list of interfaces specified at runtime when the class is created
7692303 when i first came up with the title it was from a place of pure frustration it seemed a futile thing to do you make a record and really whats the point its like milking a bee
7692304 when i first made the record i had been in a band for so long and i was always a drummer i never really contributed much melodically so it was important to me to do as much of that as i could
7692305 it got to the point where i couldnt move on to the next thing
7692306 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7692307 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7692308 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7692309 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7692310 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7692311 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7692312 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7692313 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7692314 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7692315 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7692316 when one country is firing others arent would love to have all 7 countries firing at once has not happened in in my tenure as ceo
7692317 building the b reactor was a feat of engineering genius so too was the construction a testament to the excellence of working americans
7692318 theres an enormous amount of things that can be learned here whether its about enrico fermi the history of nuclear energy or how a nuclear plant works
7692319 we want people to be able to stop in and spend some time here
7692320 all of you are aware of the serious nature of this years fire season and the issues faced by the agency in paying for fire suppression costs
7692321 at this time the only option for financing the shortfall is to use the agencys transfer authority
7692322 the unfortunate thing is that it is across the board
7692323 i recognize that this direction will have a significant effect on agency operations
7692324 however we must be in a position to protect life and property from wildfire and do so within the funds available to the agency
7692325 the fire season in montana and across the country is far from over not to mention we have good paying jobs to fund and projects around the state that need to be completed
7692326 funding should not be pulled from our states resources to help pay for fighting fires in california
7692327 on its way to build a more local model in china
7692328 this is really about her journey so far and the journey is not over this is a reminiscence of her journey on the campaign trail what her goals are and her relationship to the people she met
7692329 quite a bit about women and the generational aspect of this journey what it means for the daughters

7692335 opens its virtual doors to provide a unique service offering fine art photography at affordable prices and accessible to everyone
7692336 i am a photographer who loves this remarkable medium and ive been dismayed at the very high prices prevalent in the gallery scene for fine photographic art
7692337 on the whole fine photography is just not affordable for most folks which does a disservice to both the artist and collector lover of fine art

7692343 a policeman assigned to guard the archangel michael church in deshasha beni soueif province south of cairo hit three women while they were taking sand into the church to fix the floor which was cracked as result of water collection underneath
7692344 the worrying rise in sectarian tension that we have seen in deshasha is a direct result of violations committed by the police
7692345 this incident must be investigated and those responsible held accountable
7692346 the archangel michael church in deshasha is but one example of the futility of any efforts to reform and unify construction and renovation laws for places of worship so long as security agents continue to violate existing laws in a discriminatory manner and with complete impunity
7692347 we received credible information that drug cartels in mexico have given permission to hit targets on the u s side of the border
7692348 cbp is on heightened alert ever since we became aware of the threats in mexico
7692349 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7692350 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7692351 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7692352 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7692353 lib dem run britain backs illegal us invasion of iraq
7692354 maybe we are a little bit crazy maybe we are just bored
7692355 portuguese players like all the glamour perfume look all nice and here people just get down and get dirty
7692356 this is bizarre but when you think about it it makes training so much more fun
7692357 the sport is also a symbolical mental liberation from the restraining yoke of being constantly within reach
7692358 its our nature to create fun happenings probably because our summers are so short
7692359 at first it was difficult to promote them as they were small local events where people did not speak any foreign language
7692360 but now they are raising the interest of foreign press and visitors probably because they are so different from anything else going in their own countries
7692361 this is yet another incident of outrageous data loss which shows that this government cannot be trusted to handle sensitive information
7692362 peu importe ce quon pense de moi si je dis patate
7692363 could not be explained by other factors such as birth weight the age of the mother order of birth gestational diabetes and whether the baby was breast fed or not
7692364 not all women have the choice of whether to have a caesarean section or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
7692365 we already know that genetics and childhood infections play a vital role in the development of type 1 diabetes in children but the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life diabetes uk would welcome more research in this area
7692366 this study shows a consistent 20 increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7692367 type 1 diabetes in childhood has become much more prevalent across europe recently and the rate of this increase suggests that environmental factors are the cause however despite much investigation these actual factors remain largely unknown
7692368 its called gang war he wasnt in a gang himself but he got caught up in something that was going on he was in between something
7692369 he never started any trouble he wasnt a follower he was a leader and he always tried to tell everyone the right things to do he had just passed his college exams out of everyone i know he was doing well with his life
7692370 what has happened was completely unpredictable because he doesnt cause trouble and obviously the trouble has come to him he had loads of friends and he was really popular
7692371 i would like to go in and meet with president bush
7692372 sir mr bush is no longer president and no longer resides here
7692373 i would like to go in and meet with president bush
7692374 sir as i said yesterday mr bush is no longer president and no longer resides here
7692375 i would like to go in and meet with president bush
7692376 sir this is the third day in a row you have been here asking to speak to mr bush ive told you already that mr bush is no longer the president and no longer resides here dont you understand
7692377 isnt it funny roger how the arrested development of those weve ahem left behind is so screamingly obvious
7692378 we have decided to quit the coalition and sit on the opposition benches in parliament
7692379 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled
7692380 i dont anticipate it would have any impact on our joint efforts to combat extremism
7692381 who threaten the stability not only in pakistran but also
7692382 the ppp also violated the latest agreement reached earlier this month that the judges will be restored 24 hours after the resignation of musharraf
7692383 the ppp even nominated zardari for president and announced the election schedule without consulting our party
7692384 struggle for restoration of the judges and supreme court chief justice to challenge zardari in the september 6 presidential candidate
7692385 he is a good pakistani who is a non partisan person
7692386 despite the break up of the coalition both parties should continue to work for the stability of the country
7692387 we will play the role of constructive opposition and will not create hurdles for the ppp government
7692388 we are sad over s decision we want to move together and solve the problems facing the nation we will request nawaz sharif to return to the government
7692389 la communication crite une comp tence qui impacte votre image et celle de votre entreprise
7692390 we have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported
7692391 and we have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we dont have to worry about
7692392 black youths within this country have been left to die thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed
7692393 now were asking very serious questions of national government and local government as to why it seems that resources that have been allocated for community cohesion and other activities have not been going to those organisations
7692394 cutting funds to vital community groups at time when we are seeing so many young people involved in knife crimes would appear to go against all common sense
7692395 its not enough for ministers to talk tough on crime they also have to support projects that help stop people getting involved in crime in the first place
7692396 frankly what derrick says is an insult to black groups and other community groups up and down the country who are being funded by local and central government and work in this area on a daily and regular basis
7692397 i do need to knock down the notion that somehow there is a national conspiracy of at best indifference and at worst an active policy that says somehow the death of young black men on our streets doesnt matter it matters profoundly and it matters in every single instance whether the individual is black or white
7692398 stick to your scout promise always even after you have ceased to be a boy and god help you to do it

7692403 we are extremely proud of james commitment to the city as well as his commitment to training in an extremely tough sport
7692404 when you compete in the police and fire games you not only represent yourself but the organization and community in which you work we are all very proud of his success
7692405 i am very thankful for the support the police department has given me over the years for my boxing endeavors
7692406 i especially owe a huge dept of gratitude to sergeant ty schantz who has taken time out of his busy personal schedule to help me train
7692407 maybe we are a little bit crazy maybe we are just bored
7692408 portuguese players like all the glamour perfume look all nice and here people just get down and get dirty
7692409 this is bizarre but when you think about it it makes training so much more fun
7692410 the sport is also a symbolical mental liberation from the restraining yoke of being constantly within reach

7692414 gt itu the international organization for standardization iso and the international electrotechnical commission iec for its highly efficient video compression method to significantly reduce both the bandwidth needed to deliver high quality video and the space to store it
7692415 is a jewel in the crown of international standards collaboration
7692416 its widespread adoption is testament to the flexibility and efficiency that has been engineered by a group of people that have dedicated themselves to achieving this goal
7692417 building the b reactor was a feat of engineering genius so too was the construction a testament to the excellence of working americans

7692421 all of you are aware of the serious nature of this years fire season and the issues faced by the agency in paying for fire suppression costs
7692422 at this time the only option for financing the shortfall is to use the agencys transfer authority
7692423 the unfortunate thing is that it is across the board
7692424 i recognize that this direction will have a significant effect on agency operations
7692425 however we must be in a position to protect life and property from wildfire and do so within the funds available to the agency
7692426 the fire season in montana and across the country is far from over not to mention we have good paying jobs to fund and projects around the state that need to be completed
7692427 funding should not be pulled from our states resources to help pay for fighting fires in california
7692428 so we were ready for the next person to come cash the check
7692429 it has become clear in recent days that we just werent going to have enough staff present on the day
7692430 the open day was cancelled after management discovered union members planned to distribute leaflets and balloons calling for fair pay at ga
7692431 after working in the clinton administration in the department of commerce on internet privacy and online commerce issues hunter consulted for five years as an expert on these very same issues at a time of enormous expansion in online banking
7692432 he hunter was not a lobbyist for mbna and his work had absolutely nothing to do with the bankruptcy bill zero nothing
7692433 its the best we could get and we made made it better than it would have been
7692434 took plenty of knocks from the largest employer in his state because he demanded changes
7692435 sen biden improved the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when he believed amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments sen biden had to make the tough calls and he voted to pass a bill
7692436 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice
7692437 true religion will not let us fall asleep in the comfort of our freedom love thy neighbor is not a piece of advice its a command god my friends is with the poor and god is with us if we are with them this is not a burden this is an adventure
7692438 the july number that we just have hot off the press our internal inflation number in supermarkets in australia was 2 5 per cent mr luscombe said today
7692439 so its dropped mainly on the basis of extreme deflation in produce at the moment
7692440 the july number that we just have hot off the press our internal inflation number in supermarkets in australia was 2
7692441 there were studies into whether cats and guinea pigs can be infected this was done when the original outbreak occurred in 1994
7692442 we did a survey of bat carers and tested them and none showed any exposure to the hendra virus
7692443 bats wont be culled they are a protected species and are an important part of the ecosystem
7692444 we are far better looking at how horses catch the virus
7692445 we are studying how the virus travels in bat populations and how it is related to the reproductive cycle
7692446 phones and competing models with looks on this units mp210 we preferred the future firmware update every player is
7692447 en esta actividad se dotaron a los peque os productores para brindarles el apoyo necesario a fin de recuperar los cuerpos de agua y as comenzar la producci n de truchas ya que muchas de estas personas hab an abandonado sus lagunas porque anteriormente el estado los ten a abandonados

7692452 weve got to stop taxes going up weve got to stop the council tax going up stop hitting people so badly and then progressively trying to reduce the burdens on ordinary people by giving them back some of the hard earned money theyve lost e very time we go into a budget were going to be thinking how can we reduce taxes is it possible is it prudent to do so we wont be doing what this government has been doing which is going into every budget trying to think how they can get away with actually putting taxes up
7692453 when it would be responsible to do so under the circumstances in which the economy is growing and the public finances are sound and youre able to say to people look i know who earns the money in this economy its you the taxpayers the business and i can give some back to you
7692454 look if you take the last couple of elections weve gone into them with incredibly complicated schemes to reduce waste and cut this lot of spending and fund that bit of tax reduction and i think its both confused people and i think they found it lacking in credibility i think its better to say look this is the state of the economy frankly after labours economic incompetence were going to have to take some pretty tough decisions to get the public finances sorted and as and when we can we will reduce taxes i think thats fairer
7692455 o ften people will say look does it really matter if the economy grows at 3 5 per cent rather than 3 2 per cent and over a long period of time yes it really does i had dinner with the swedish prime minister this week and their economic record in the last century was incredible because they did have relatively rapid growth and they went from being one of the poorest countries in europe to being one of the richest
7692456 obviously income inequality does matter but i think the gap that matters most is the gap between the bottom and the middle
7692457 i think its possible to have more money than you need in a global economy very rich people will obviously get even richer but they pay taxes and make a great contribution to the economy and we should do more to encourage philanthropy you could say in this age we should just tax rich people more but i dont think thats the right answer theyre very mobile and if we taxed them they would just move away youd just reduce their incentives much better i think to encourage philanthropy endowing universities like they do in america lets have the same sort of private philanthopic giving on the scale that you have in other countries
7692458 nowhere does the dear leader destined to be pm two years hence or sooner even begin to notice the elephant in the room
7692459 frankly after labours economic incompetence were going to have to take some pretty tough decisions to get the public finances sorted
7692460 all of you are aware of the serious nature of this years fire season and the issues faced by the agency in paying for costs
7692461 at this time the only option for financing the shortfall is to use the agencys transfer authority
7692462 the unfortunate thing is that it is across the board

7692464 however we must be in a position to protect life and property from wildfire and do so within the funds available to the agency
7692465 funding should not be pulled from our states resources to help pay for fighting fires in allocated to fighting fires have steadily increased rising about 10 percent from 2006 to 2007 but have not been able to meet the needs of this years large fires said rose davis spokeswoman for the agencys northern region
7692466 flight centre starts the new financial year with significant momentum from 2007 08 a strong balance sheet and with foundations in place for further growth acting chief executive shannon obrien said
7692467 while we do not expect to replicate the 30 per cent to 40 per cent increases we have achieved in each of the past two years we will be disappointed if we do not increase pre tax profit by 10 to 15 per cent
7692468 flight centre continues to increase its scale in all countries while also developing a broader foundation mr obrien said
7692469 in addition to being one of the worlds leading leisure travel providers the company is now a significant and emerging presence in global corporate and wholesale travel
7692470 we see our diversity of both brands and geography as a platform for the future and a real strength
7692471 whilst we are pleased with the momentum in the business we are mindful that discretionary spending continues to be influenced by macro economic factors such as inflation fluctuating petrol prices interest rates and lower consumer confidence levels it said
7692472 this investment continues to deliver gains in market share he said
7692473 australian food and liquor continues to perform well and big w petrol and consumer electronics have had a good start to the new financial year
7692474 new zealand supermarkets has experienced tight trading conditions as in the fourth quarter it said
7692475 our current focus is to maintain a capital structure that will preserve our capital strength and give us the flexibility to pursue further growth opportunities
7692476 our balance sheet debt profile and strength of our credit ratings ensure we are very well placed for future growth both organically and through acquisition
7692477 any international expansion would have full oversight from the board be undertaken in a prudent and disciplined fashion and meet the hurdles required for all our capital investment decisions it said
7692478 youre looking at the beta release of the new look for developerworks articles this new design is more streamlined and lets you pdo mysqlnd the new features of pdo mysql in php 5 3 internet
7692479 it would mean for example in this current financial year a surplus of 20 billion instead of 21 5 billion
7692480 lets not be lectured by the labor party about fiscal rectitude they have nothing to tell us
7692481 they certainly dont have a mandate for these completely unjustifiable tax increases
7692482 what the government is actually doing is taxing australians now in an unjustifiable way in order to spend it later in order to buy their way back into office in 2010
7692483 but we are not going to vote for tax increases that we dont think the government has made the case for that are unjustifiable and simply increase prices for ordinary australians
7692484 now this part will help you perform a few tasks in ooo that were available in ms office just harder to figure out due to the different interface
7692485 here well show you some simple tips and tricks so that you can use openoffice in the easiest and most efficient way possible acer aspire one zg5 linux

7692488 the ordinance was made for a reason and you could build four stories and make less of a profit
7692489 if you owned it maybe id look at it a different way but you dont even own it
7692490 the developers we feel have no interest in working with this community or even being a part of it and have no interest in assuring that kew gardens remains a great place to live
7692491 they only want a profit and to continue what has become the overdevelopment of queens
7692492 our building is not necessarily in the best of shape and we are concerned because of this construction
7692493 the zoning for this particular site is wrong the zoning should be changed to better reflect the character of the neighborhood and the traffic patterns that are here
7692494 this neighborhood cannot handle that much more congestion traffic pollution
7692495 the city has a strategic plan for large scale development near wide roads in theory this makes sense
7692496 barack obamas father was muslim and therefore according to islamic law so is the candidate in spite of the quranic verses explaining that there is no compulsion in religion a muslim child takes the religion of his or her father for muslims around the world non american muslims at any rate they can only ever see barack hussein obama as a muslim
7692497 obama may not want to be counted as a muslim but muslims are eager to count him as one of their own
7692498 i wrote the book in the hopes that children will get better lives
7692499 i want to see more integration and the responsibility for that lies with the somalians themselves and with the authorities
7692500 newspapers tell you about the world magazines tell you about
7692501 het filmpje is inbraak op de auteursrecht van het logo van de bank omdat het onrechtmatig wordt gebruikt
7692502 de abn laat ook geen column verwijderen als de naam abn daar in wordt genoemd
7692503 het gedoe rond de fusie is pas schadelijk voor het imago van het bedrijf en het is de taak van alle jokers en narren in dit land om daar op te reageren
7692504 dat het filmpje schadelijk zou zijn voor het imago is onzin
7692505 we honestly think that they had planned it out but not to shoot em but like just to scare him
7692506 he was bawlin hes like im sorry i did not mean for any of this to happen hes like im scared
7692507 he has 2 twins back at home and another one on the way and he just wanted to support his family so he came up here and hed like just got here a couple of days ago
7692508 they got in a fight about a week before and he said that he made a comment the he was gonna end up dealing with hes like ill deal with you later
7692509 i just feel bad the guy had to go down like that and he had nothing to do with anything
7692510 why am i assuming the risk under the hold harmless clause
7692511 we know from our own research that young people from many low and medium income families dont even consider post secondary education because they think it will be too expensive
7692512 today we are telling them and we are telling their families that a low income should not be a barrier to anyone
7692513 at that time it will be forgiven and were of the mind that if people are in the situation after 15 years where they are still struggling to pay its not worth it for us to pursue it
7692514 secondly we want people to get on with their lives its a lot of burden no ones going to choose to be pursued for fifteen years by the government in terms of repayment
7692515 if students are from a lower income family they will receive a 250 upfront cash grant each month they are in school
7692516 in other words if you are a low income student in a four year program you will receive eight thousand in canada student grants over the course of your education
7692517 if they are going to income contingent loan repayment the problem with that is that if there is no interest rate adjustment well be expanding the time to which people repay their loans which means theyll pay more interest at these high rates
7692518 the issue really isnt student interest rates its the ability of students to repay
7692519 go a lot further than reducing interest rates a point
7692520 the changes weve put in place really help people no matter what their situation
7692521 its up to the provinces to decide how they want to do it but weve taken an approach that we think is more universal that captures all the reasons that people struggle to pay
7692522 minister solbergs commitment to help improve access for low and middle income students and the governments new initiative to help relieve student debt is reassuring for those who are faced with the burden of such barriers
7692523 and i would respond to your other points but as youve stated you put your life on hold for this

7692535 reporters were not allowed to ask harper questions and he made no mention of the violence that has beset manitoba in recent weeks including the beheading death of tim mclean on a greyhound bus near portage la prairie last week the police shooting of craig mcdougall last saturday that has raised the ire of aboriginal leaders or the death of michael langan late last month after he had been shocked by taser
7692536 terrorism is the best political weapon for nothing drives people harder than a fear of sudden death
7692537 your enemy is not surrounding your country your enemy is ruling your country
7692538 mossad provoked americas air strike on libya in 1986 by making it appear that terrorist orders were being transmitted from the libyan government to its embassies
7692539 well holy shit if this is a terrorist attack we need to get something in the air
7692540 people just launched into action there was a buzz in the unit
7692541 one of the most modern bases in the air force
7692542 is not part of the norad north american aerospace defense command air sovereignty force and did not have an alert mission
7692543 capable and ready response forces for the district of columbia in the event of a natural disaster or civil emergency
7692544 air defense around washington dc is provided mainly by fighter planes from andrews air force base
7692545 we practice scrambles i e taking off as fast as possible to inspect enemy aircraft we know how to do intercepts and other things
7692546 still contain ed all the nellis data from the red flag training exercise they just returned from
7692547 do you have any additional information are you guys going to need some help
7692548 at that time we werent thinking about defending anything our primary concern was what would happen to the air traffic system
7692549 can you guys do anything can you get some fighters in the air as soon as possible
7692550 then the secret service agent told us to stand by and that somebody else would call
7692551 as dcang is a general purpose f 16 unit no one was specifically tasked with keeping the squadron informed
7692552 first inkling that the attacks would go beyond new york was when one of his officers whose husband worked at the pentagon saw on television that the building had been hit and began shrieking
7692553 raced out of his office and ran several hundred yards to the headquarters of the dc guards 121st fighter squadron
7692554 we have to get instructions we cant just fly off half cocked
7692555 i would feel more comfortable receiving such an order from someone higher in the chain of command preferably in the military
7692556 we want you to put a cap up over the city we need some fighters now
7692557 not very comfortable taking orders from a secret service agent thats just not how things are done
7692558 is there anybody else there from the military available to talk
7692559 okay then what exactly do they want me to do
7692560 to send up the aircraft with orders to protect the white house and take out any aircraft that threatened the capitol
7692561 without afterburner to conserve fuel go across the white house over the georgetown area and continue northwest up the potomac
7692562 within minutes of american airlines flight 77 hitting the pentagon
7692563 naval air operations support for the naval district of washington

7692609 all of you are aware of the serious nature of this years fire season and the issues faced by the agency in paying for fire suppression costs
7692610 at this time the only option for financing the shortfall is to use the agencys transfer authority
7692611 the unfortunate thing is that it is across the board
7692612 i recognize that this direction will have a significant effect on agency operations
7692613 however we must be in a position to protect life and property from wildfire and do so within the funds available to the agency
7692614 the fire season in montana and across the country is far from over not to mention we have good paying jobs to fund and projects around the state that need to be completed

7692666 colombias president lvaro uribe should tell his friends that he does not want a third term last week his backers delivered five million signatures to election authorities calling for a referendum to modify the constitution so mr uribe can run yet again colombia has already changed its constitution once so mr uribe could be re elected in 2006 go to the board mr uribe has made important progress in the war against brutal left wing guerrillas and has curbed colombias unrelenting violence his approval ratings topped 90 percent following last months daring operation to rescue several high profile hostages but he has showed too little respect for the institutions of colombian democracy after the supreme court started investigating dozens of his congressional allies for alleged ties to right wing paramilitaries he accused the court of being politically motivated he has now proposed reforms that would remove the investigation of members of congress from the supreme courts jurisdiction the plan is unlikely to meet much resistance parties allied with mr uribe have a large majority in congress and about a fifth of the congresss members are under investigation or have been arrested in these cases colombias neighborhood has too many authoritarian minded leaders venezuelas president hugo ch vez leveraged his enormous popularity to take control of virtually every aspect of his countrys political and economic life venezuelas voters wisely blocked his plans for indefinite re election presidents evo morales of bolivia and rafael correa of ecuador are also trying to amend their constitutions so they can run again the region needs democracy underpinned by strong institutions it does not need more strongmen however popular they may be or indispensable they may consider themselves mr uribe should make clear now that this will be his last term if he does he will be remembered as the leader who brought colombia back from the brink and onto a path toward peace if he moves to change the constitution so he can stay he will tarnish his legacy and further weaken the system of checks and balances that are essential to colombias democracy
7692667 reflexiones sobre las actuaciones judiciales en colombia a la luz de los est ndares internacionales
7692668 tenemos un m ximo n mero de cr menes y una cantidad masiva de criminales
7692669 se mezclan los grupos y ese es el papel de la fiscal a establecer a los responsables
7692670 el mundo no acepta m s impunidad para estos cr menes y colombia deber ser ejemplo
7692671 los gobiernos de colombia y de ee uu han perfeccionado acuerdos para permitir la continuaci n de las diligencias de justicia y paz con plenas garant as para las v ctimas
7692672 nosotros creemos que es posible avanzar en negociaciones con bloques y frentes y ofrecerles una salida digna venimos haciendo un an lisis muy cuidadoso de la situaci n de hecho hemos tenido contactos con algunos mandos importantes de frentes y bloques de la guerrilla tanto de las farc como del eln y vemos que es viable avanzar en esas desmovilizaciones
7692673 hay cansancio eso lo hemos evidenciado hay p rdida del sentido de lucha y por eso creemos que hay una situaci n madura para las desmovilizaciones colectivas el reto es convencerlos de que tambi n con ellos podemos pactar procesos dignos
7692674 no podemos ilusionarnos con di logos con c pulas rezagadas y soberbias que no han hecho otra cosa que jugar con la esperanza de paz de todo el pa s siguen sin entender que en colombia y el mundo ya no hay espacio para la lucha armada pero si estas c pulas se bajan de su arrogancia el gobierno tiende los puentes del di logo
7692675 1 115 millones de d lares por nuevas inversiones 2 610 millones por reinversi n de utilidades y 2 680 millones por un aumento neto de los pasivos de las empresas con sus matrices en el exterior

7692677 ahora respecto del gasto social tenemos que garantizar que este sea eficiente y que los subsidios de los programas sociales lleguen a las personas que realmente los necesitan
7692678 no podemos malgastar los impuestos que paga la poblaci n muchas veces en lugar de contratar temporalmente a un grupo de trabajo para solucionar un problema se contrata a gente de manera permanente as como se han reducido de 28 a 12 los programas sociales tambi n debemos reducir el n mero de oficinas tener una ventanilla nica para qu tanto gasto
7692679 acceder a reclamaci n de ind genas ser a un error hist rico
7692680 para m hondure o que se oponga al ingreso de honduras al alba es un vendepatria o es un ignorante una de dos no tengo otra forma de calificarlo o es porque ignora y si lo ignora pues deber a darse a la tarea de leer primero antes de emitir opini n

7692682 para m hondure o que se oponga al ingreso de honduras al alba es un vendepatria o es un ignorante
7692683 cu l podr a ser el marco legal para su desmovilizaci n farc y eln descartemos de plano la posibilidad de una ley de amnist a dado que esta no es viable en el mundo de hoy y menos desde la creaci n de la corte penal internacional de la haya los cr menes de guerra y de lesa humanidad no pueden ser objeto de amnist a o indulto
7692684 diversas autoridades en torno a las relaciones bilaterales y hemisf ricas as como para respaldar las gestiones que buscan la aprobaci n del tratado de libre comercio tlc con estados unidos
7692685 reducir la brecha entre la realidad y la percepci n
7692686 ten amos que escucharlos porque aqu hay tr fico de testigos
7692687 me van a decir a m que no tengo autoridad moral para presentar la reforma pol tica y la reforma a la justicia cuando en el gobierno se han desmontado los paramilitares y se ha debilitado la guerrilla
7692688 yo creo que es temerario salir a decir que entraron a la presidencia clandestinamente
7692689 vamos a dar un chance a cemex nosotros queremos arreglar eso amistosamente
7692690 original post by contra costa times and software by elliott back
7692691 some children with autism are poor detoxifiers relative to normally developing children and in particular have trouble excreting toxic metals
7692692 toxic metals that are not eliminated may build up in the brain plasma glutathione has been found to be lower in children with autism particularly in children with autism who have regressed we want to clearly establish that raising glutathione levels in these children will improve their ability to detoxify these substances and in that way improve some of their symptoms
7692693 we know that immunocal has been used to raise glutathione in other studies very effectively in areas such as cancer and lung disease we want to take advantage of this same technology
7692694 forgive this personal comment i do not want my grandson to get a thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on
7692695 we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits
7692696 this will be a resource to our very busy plaintiff attorneys in this country
7692697 given the sensitivity of the information we have been able to keep it out of the hands of lets say less responsible hands
7692698 perhaps this study should not have been done at all
7692699 will be taken by others and will be used in other ways beyond the control of this group
7692700 the lawsuits are of such magnitude that they could put vaccine producers out of business and limit our capacity to deal with a biological attack by terrorists
7692701 thimerosal used as a preservative in vaccines is directly related to the autism epidemic
7692702 this epidemic in all probability may have been prevented or curtailed had the fda not been asleep at the switch regarding a lack of safety data regarding injected thimerosal a known neurotoxin
7692703 the elementary grades are overwhelmed with children who have symptoms of neurological or immune system damage
7692704 vaccines are supposed to be making us healthier however in twenty five years of nursing i have never seen so many damaged sick kids something very very wrong is happening to our children
7692705 if the epidemic is truly an artifact of poor diagnosis
7692706 you couldnt even construct a study that shows thimerosal is safe
7692707 its just too darn toxic if you inject thimerosal into an animal its brain will sicken if you apply it to living tissue the cells die if you put it in a petri dish the culture dies knowing these things it would be shocking if one could inject it into an infant without causing damage
7692708 is to switch to dispensing the actual vaccines without adding preservatives
7692709 what took the fda so long to do the calculations
7692710 why didnt cdc and the advisory bodies do these calculations when they rapidly expanded the childhood immunization schedule
7692711 i think if we really have an influenza pandemic and certainly we will in the next twenty years because we always do theres no way on gods earth that we immunize 280 million people with single dose vials there has to be multidose vials
7692712 routinely allows scientists with blatant conflicts of interest to serve on intellectual advisory committees that make recommendations on new vaccines
7692713 interests in the products and companies for which they are supposed to be providing unbiased oversight
7692714 had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that were developing different versions of the vaccine
7692715 i have simply been informed by the process not corrupted by it when i sat around that table my sole intent was trying to make recommendations that best benefited the children in this country its offensive to say that physicians and public health people are in the pocket of industry and thus are making decisions that they know are unsafe for children its just not the way it works
7692716 im not sure there will be an easy way out of the potential perception that the fda cdc and immunization policy bodies may have been asleep at the switch re thimerosal until now
7692717 will also raise questions about various advisory bodies regarding aggressive recommendations for use
7692718 wants us to declare well that these things are pretty safe
7692719 we are not ever going to come down that autism is a true side effect
7692720 the more negative that our presentation is the less likely people are to use vaccination immunization and we know what the results of that will be we are kind of caught in a trap how we work our way out of the trap i think is the charge
7692721 four current studies are taking place to rule out the proposed link between autism and thimerosal
7692722 in order to undo the harmful effects of research claiming to link the measles vaccine to an elevated risk of autism we need to conduct and publicize additional studies to assure parents of safety
7692723 an association between vaccines and autism would force them to admit that their policies irreparably damaged thousands of children who would want to make that conclusion about themselves
7692724 after three years of review i became convinced there was sufficient credible research to show a link between mercury and the increased incidences in autism
7692725 the fact that iowas 700 percent increase in autism began in the 1990s right after more and more vaccines were added to the childrens vaccine schedules is solid evidence alone
7692726 the damage caused by vaccine exposure is massive its bigger than asbestos bigger than tobacco bigger than anything youve ever seen
7692727 the july number that we just have hot off the press our internal inflation number in supermarkets in australia was 2 5 per cent mr luscombe said today
7692728 so its dropped mainly on the basis of extreme deflation in produce at the moment
7692729 hell be there for you as hes been there for me
7692730 the aim and final end of all music should be none other than the glory of god and the refreshment of the soul
7692731 la verdad es que estamos en una situaci n l mite la nica esperanza que tenemos para realmente revertir la tendencia y mantener nuestra posici n de exportadores netos de hidrocarburos es aumentar de manera dram tica la inversi n en exploraci n de crudo y en refinaci n de petrol feros los nicos que no parecen haberse dado cuenta son los senadores y diputados que tendr an que hacer los cambios de ley
7692732 ls cifras son contundentes pero nuestros senadores y diputados quieren seguir perdiendo el tiempo sin que nadie los distraiga con algo tan molesto como la realidad tendr que llegar el momento en que nos convirtamos en importadores netos de hidrocarburos para que se den cuenta de la urgencia de la reforma petrolera a fondo que se han negado a hacer lo peor de todo es que no tendr n que esperar mucho tiempo en menos de tres a os seremos ya importadores netos de hidrocarburos y para entonces ser ya muy dif cil dar marcha atr s seg n datos oficiales de pemex la producci n de petr leo crudo de nuestro pa s cay de 3 millones 396 barriles diarios en enero julio del 2004 a 2 millones 846 mil en el mismo per odo del 2008 se trata de un descenso de 16 por ciento en apenas cuatro a os la ca da ha tenido lugar a pesar de que durante el sexenio de vicente fox se registr un aumento muy importante en el monto que pemex invirti en exploraci n este descenso es producto en buena medida de la ca da en la producci n de cantarell el principal yacimiento de petr leo de nuestro pa s y de hecho el mayor del mundo en aguas someras de un pico de 2 millones 152 mil barriles diarios en enero julio de 2004 el rendimiento de cantarell ha ca do 48 por ciento para llegar a 1 mill n 127 mil en los siete primeros meses del 2008 el volumen de exportaci n de crudo de nuestro pa s ha descendido como consecuencia directa de la declinaci n de cantarell de 1 mill n 869 mil barriles diarios en los siete primeros meses del 2006 a 1 mill n 443 mil en el mismo per odo del 2008 la ca da es pues de 23 por ciento los altos precios del petr leo los mayores en la historia nos han permitido acumular exportaciones por 30 039 millones de d lares en apenas los siete primeros meses de este 2008 lo cual es el monto m s alto para un per odo de enero a julio en toda la historia del pa s hace una d cada en 1998 est bamos exportando apenas 4 mil millones en el mismo lapso del a o el problema es que el valor de nuestras importaciones de hidrocarburos y sus derivados principalmente gasolina diesel y gas est subiendo a un ritmo todav a mayor en enero julio de 2004 m xico import 2 556 millones de d lares por este concepto para el mismo per odo de 2008 la cifra se increment a 15 197 millones este es un aumento de 495 por ciento en cuatro a os tan s lo entre 2007 y 2008 el crecimiento de estas importaciones ha sido de 76 por ciento la verdad es que estamos en una situaci n l mite la nica esperanza que tenemos para realmente revertir la tendencia y mantener nuestra posici n de exportadores netos de hidrocarburos es aumentar de manera dram tica la inversi n en exploraci n de crudo y en refinaci n de petrol feros los nicos que no parecen haberse dado cuenta son los senadores y diputados que tendr an que hacer los cambios de ley que permitieran precisamente ese gran aumento en la inversi n
7692733 whilst we are pleased with the momentum in the business we are mindful that discretionary spending continues to be influenced by macro economic factors such as inflation fluctuating petrol prices interest rates and lower consumer confidence levels it said
7692734 this investment continues to deliver gains in market share he said
7692735 australian food and liquor continues to perform well and big w petrol and consumer electronics have had a good start to the new financial year
7692736 new zealand supermarkets has experienced tight trading conditions as in the fourth quarter it said
7692737 our current focus is to maintain a capital structure that will preserve our capital strength and give us the flexibility to pursue further growth opportunities
7692738 our balance sheet debt profile and strength of our credit ratings ensure we are very well placed for future growth both organically and through acquisition
7692739 any international expansion would have full oversight from the board be undertaken in a prudent and disciplined fashion and meet the hurdles required for all our capital investment decisions it said
7692740 there were studies into whether cats and guinea pigs can be infected this was done when the original outbreak occurred in 1994
7692741 we did a survey of bat carers and tested them and none showed any exposure to the hendra virus
7692742 bats wont be culled they are a protected species and are an important part of the ecosystem
7692743 we are far better looking at how horses catch the virus
7692744 we are studying how the virus travels in bat populations and how it is related to the reproductive cycle
7692745 flight centre starts the new financial year with significant momentum from 2007 08 a strong balance sheet and with foundations in place for further growth acting chief executive shannon obrien said
7692746 while we do not expect to replicate the 30 per cent to 40 per cent increases we have achieved in each of the past two years we will be disappointed if we do not increase pre tax profit by 10 to 15 per cent
7692747 flight centre continues to increase its scale in all countries while also developing a broader foundation mr obrien said
7692748 in addition to being one of the worlds leading leisure travel providers the company is now a significant and emerging presence in global corporate and wholesale travel
7692749 we see our diversity of both brands and geography as a platform for the future and a real strength
7692750 it would mean for example in this current financial year a surplus of 20 billion instead of 21 5 billion
7692751 lets not be lectured by the labor party about fiscal rectitude they have nothing to tell us
7692752 they certainly dont have a mandate for these completely unjustifiable tax increases
7692753 what the government is actually doing is taxing australians now in an unjustifiable way in order to spend it later in order to buy their way back into office in 2010
7692754 no se ponga en riesgo la riqueza nacional de la industria petrolera
7692755 boart longyears 2008 first half results reflect continued strong growth from both our drilling services and products divisions due to ongoing high demand particularly in mineral exploration the companys chief executive designate president and chief operating officer craig kipp said
7692756 boart longyear has seen little impact on demand despite uncertainties in global financial markets
7692757 we have managed the increasing cost pressures from steel oil and labour effectively mr kip said

7692817 there are going to be some of senator clintons supporters we have to work hard to persuade to come on board thats not surprising
7692818 ive never heard anything as awful or as sexist or as racist as to call her that for supporting hillary
7692819 she walked away and i said all you doubting thomases got to get on board
7692820 i said no thats not so and i thought you know it was all over with you know she caught the last word of what i said you know people make mistakes
7692821 i cannot apologize for one misinterpreting what i said thats all i can say
7692822 he knows what he said to me he knows he called me an uncle tom hes trying to backtrack now theres playful jousting and theres stepping over the line
7692823 i think its a misuse of words theres no uncle toms anybody supporting hillary obama its just a mischoice of words
7692824 last night i was called an uncle tom by emil jones in the lobby of the hotel right in front of ald freddrenna lyle and ald leslie hairston and ald latasha thomas
7692825 i walked over to him and asked him what did you just call me
7692826 if people are still making digs at the hillary clinton people because we supported her that is not going to bring us on board it makes us feel as though were outsiders and were democrats cobb said the litmus test for being black is seen as supporting barack
7692827 you can tell the hillary clinton people they never take the buttons
7692828 i told her i never said that she may have misunderstood
7692829 that was not that was not thats all i have to say
7692830 i said then 35 000 people drank the kool aid he said barack is a clean cut guy he never liked gutter politics thats why the clintons did so and so i said i dont want to get into this so i went over to the elevator and he said uncle tom then he grabbed me and hugged me and started laughing i said what did you say i turned to freddrenna lyle and i said what did he say she wouldnt say anything thats when i said some bad things to him
7692831 calling me an uncle tom is beyond the pale especially considering where he is close with mayor daley and with gov blagojevich i am hardly the uncle tom here

7692874 i think its a great idea i always bring my own bag and its a small price to pay and it will encourage people to recycle
7692875 californians use 19 billion plastic grocery bags every year and it costs us over 300 million per year in tax payers funds to clean those up from the beaches from the sewers from the waterways and thats a significant amount of money
7692876 girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short wear shirts and boots because its ok to be a boy but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading because you think that being a girl is degrading but secretly youd love to know what its like wouldnt you what it feels like for a girl
7692877 this literally is life or death there are 4 100 americans who gave up their lives because of a republican president a miscalculation dishonesty and totally poor judgment about what should happen around the world and what our role was
7692878 we cant afford another four years of the policies of george bush
7692879 i dont think people realize how much damage they have done
7692880 because of what that general assembly did this year people are going to die
7692881 i am not mincing words we have got tons at stake
7692882 the only hope in this country right now i believe is the leadership of barack obama and the democratic party
7692883 thats why we are here this week to tell the american people and show the american people
7692884 we were all licking our wounds and one of the things we kept saying was the democratic party really doesnt stand for anything thats the way we were feeling then
7692885 thank god for george bush and the neo cons because they have shown us the difference between republican and democratic philosophies
7692886 clearly it makes a difference about who we elect to office
7692887 i think that her talents could be put to better use elsewhere she didnt spend 30 years working for our party working for america to be second on the ticket with a political newcomer i just dont think vice president would have been an appropriate consolation prize if you will
7692888 we know were going to have to play our best to stay in the game
7692889 if were fortunate to win or if they take it to us
7692890 i think it would give us a much more comfortable margin in the house and that will be helpful in getting legislation through
7692891 the most significant election would be to get close to 60 seats to overcome a filibuster
7692892 i think its important for california to realize that we have two eastern senators on one ticket and then you have senator mccain who is often referred to as californias third senator
7692893 it will cost an average family some 550 of additional taxes at a time when theyre struggling to pay their electricity bill their gasoline bill and a tax burden that is already one of the highest in the nation
7692894 and thats why charlie browns insistence on passing a budget with the second biggest tax increase in the history of california is so appalling and why its important to understand what it would do to our economy
7692895 i think its important for california to realize that we have two eastern senators on one ticket and then you have senator mccain who is often referred to as californias third senator
7692896 given his story and ability to finance his own campaign its hardly surprising that many political insiders say the future of the california gop lies in the hands of poizner
7692897 since taking the helm of the california department of insurance poizner has proven adept in slashing red tape declaring insurance emergencies to ensure valid claims are paid out quickly
7692898 i think its important for california to realize that we have two eastern senators on one ticket and then you have senator mccain who is often referred to as californias third senator

7692908 ive come out very clearly very confidently my conscience is clear
7692909 ken is a highly respected figure both in new zealand business and among trade union organisations internationally
7692910 his experience and insight have been extremely valuable to air new zealands board
7692911 i think the only conclusion to draw from this is that if you cant run an opposition its pretty hard to argue you should be running a government within the next three months
7692912 weve laid out our principles quite clearly in relation to using private sector capital for roading projects and for investment in infrastructure
7692913 we havent actually agreed what those projects might be or what the level of toll might be but they have to fit certain conditions and well be meeting those conditions
7692914 the agenda was secret until maurice blurted it and the prospect of having the 50 extra tax cut they promised the average worker snatched away by the weekly toll bill of course makes it clear their policies are all about taking with one hand giving with the other
7692915 despite fare increases air new zealand continues to only partially recover the increase in the total cost of fuel

7692938 theyre all sweet and theyre all trying so hard and working so hard and i wouldnt trade places with them for all the tea in china i figure if you can go through these grueling weeks that theyve gone through after this theyll be able to do just about anything
7692939 i really thought long and hard on this whole thing and ive been watching them for a few weeks just to prepare myself so i would have some real criticism or some constructive criticism for them and ive thrown it their way and they can either take it or leave it i guess

7692941 this study shows a consistent 20 increase in the risk of diabetes
7692942 it is important to stress that the reason for this is still not understood although it is possible that the caesarean section itself is responsible perhaps because babies born via that method are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7692943 type 1 diabetes in childhood has become more prevalent across europe recently and the rate of this increase suggests that environmental factors are the cause
7692944 however despite much investigation these actual factors remain largely unknown
7692945 the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life

7693091 some of the statements from russian officials such as threatening to target poland with nuclear weapons and things of that nature have certainly made this a much more difficult issue to deal with
7693092 as i mentioned the host governments retain the sovereignty and the legal right to decide who visits their territory threatening to target them with nuclear weapons is not something thats generally viewed positively to say the least
7693093 the russian government understands the limited capabilities of this system
7693094 we have had unprecedented discussions that have explained the technical capabilities of the system i think on the face of it they understand that 10 interceptors in poland would have no impact on the russian strategic offensive forces they know the capabilities of this system and they know it does not pose a threat to russia

7693100 besides if wed actually asked you you would have said you were too busy moping to come
7693101 doctor you are the king of moping ive never met someone who mopes as much as you do which reminds me none of that at marthas wedding thanks this is supposed to be happy
7693102 i was thinking more along the lines of making sure you got to see one of your best friends on the happiest day of her life
7693103 everyone who travels with you learns to recognize it quickly
7693104 youre much more fun when youre not moping and less likely to bite someones head off
7693105 i should never have told you about rose and donna
7693106 deep down youre glad you did we would have tried calling them to get them to nag you into coming and they wouldnt have gotten our messages and then you would have missed the entire thing
7693107 you know how these work and theyre a bit more inconspicuous than regular handcuffs
7693108 arent people supposed to want to spare their friends pain and besides some of us are limited in how often we can come back from being killed
7693109 sometimes youre ridiculously gullible i turned down the voltage of course its not going to kill you
7693110 martha even saw me at the wedding why do i have to go to the reception as well
7693111 with my life yes to judge whether or not ill think a partys fun no
7693112 and dont tell me youre not planning anything its very obvious you are
7693113 i think you and i have different definitions of bad
7693114 im not doing this to torture you you know there are some people there i think youd like to see thats all
7693115 if i promise not to run away will you get the cuffs off and give me my sonic screwdriver back
7693116 and one of his friends a girl named maria theyre talking to some of marthas younger cousins marias trying to get him used to being around normal humans did i tell you how i found him
7693117 most of you looks younger but part of you looks older
7693118 those of us who knew you kept in some sort of contact throughout the years and we heard about marthas travels with you fairly soon after shed joined you may not have been interested in seeing us again but we were still your friends and we wanted to know how you were doing so we started talking to her
7693119 i just wanted to let you live your lives and whos we precisely
7693120 i dont know who else jack harkness of torchwood might have been able to contact
7693121 i didnt want to travel with you anymore i couldnt do that but that doesnt stop me from being your friend or caring about you and when martha and jack said you needed your friends i wanted to come
7693122 why are they here my old friends i mean since its your wedding and tegan and jo both told me that they were here to be my friend i was just wondering why you invited them isnt the focus here supposed to be on you
7693123 i was wondering when you were going to ask that
7693124 but you know doctor its only because of you that were all here and i dont just mean alive though of course thats thanks to you as well but id never have even met tom if it werent for you
7693125 by hunting down my old friends and asking them to meet me at your reception what happened to a box of chocolates and a card as a thank you i wouldnt have said no to a box of chocolates especially the ones with the tasty fillings
7693126 it took me a bit to realize this because i hadnt thought even you would be so stupid but once i did i wondered why it hadnt occurred to me before doctor you do know that davros was wrong about you dont you
7693127 because i think youre just saying what you think i want to hear when jack told me about rose and donna and his theory on why you did that to rose especially i agreed i know you mister you take too much blame on yourself from what i hear from jack i dont think rose would have let you turn her into a weapon even if you tried
7693128 look at all those people whose lives you did not ruin theyre here and theyre laughing and theyre happy and so am i and all of us who are lucky enough to have you consider us friends we want you to be happy too
7693129 you turned us into people who can take care of ourselves and other people as well you gave us wonderful experiences that enriched our lives were happy with who and where we are today because of you
7693130 you think about what i said im going back to tom
7693131 but i was just talking to mr lethbridge stewart there and he said that youd been over nine hundred more than three bodies ago
7693132 youre not the only planet with a year you know
7693133 by the standards of some i am nine hundred and three years old
7693134 normally youre all for satisfying your curiosity why not satisfy ours
7693135 you do know youre just making us more curious than if youd just told us straight out

7693140 yesterday was very very bad but the challenge is for everybody to restore confidence in the sport obviously wed like to see show jumping remains as an olympic sport
7693141 im fit enough to continue coaching the australian eventing team i think ive outlasted most other people and im older than them
7693142 its only a matter of time before we have more high class horses per rider than any other country in the world now you marry that in with a nation that is basically a group of sporting freaks and i dont think you need to be einstein to work out that the gold medals that have become nearly an australian inheritance in eventing we are going to do that in dressage
7693143 if the horse likes the music we made for the horses then they can dance
7693144 we didnt win by default in 2004 others just didnt play by the rules we have lived for four years with people whining about that today was an exclamation point for that and today was one of the greatest days for the sport in north america

7693182 being a mother has taught me more about the grace of god and my own shortcomings than any other experience in my life i see gods grace every morning as they wake up healthy and strong as they laugh and giggle as they run and play as their minds develop right before my eyes my biggest lesson learned is to cherish every moment with your children they grow too fast god never gives you more than you can handle and i am going to do all that i can for my little ones especially when they face challenges
7693183 true some of the lessons theyve taught me were not very fun as they were happening but the good moments mix up with the not so good moments in a wonderful curriculum ordained for me by god himself
7693184 i honestly can say that being a mother is the most powerful and important feeling in the world
7693185 god gave me strength when i couldnt go on life when my body was trying to shut down encouragement to my broken heart meals when the refrigerator was empty a place to live when ends did not meet peace in the midst of turmoil and a contentment that went beyond my circumstances sure life gets hard now and then my heart may still become anxious and my mind may begin to assume the worse but today i know that contentment comes from within i have learned to be content regardless of my circumstances because god is faithful to me i am so very blessed

7693198 i dont know what our government does period i california hypocritically talks new oil tax to stop legislators salary cuts planned parenthood bilks 180 million from california taxpayers
7693199 i encouraged cindy to compete i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as first lady and miss buffalo chip
7693200 i think if ordinary everyday americans understood that we are sacrificing the lives of our sons and daughters to get somebody elses oil to drive energy inefficient vehicles that pollute the atmosphere that would dramatize it a lot more
7693201 i would hope that leaders in our country would let people know that we are in fact trading the lives of young people for a corrupt energy policy
7693202 but weve got a leader and i think hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances
7693203 hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances and the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7693204 we are led by a very talented person in brendan nelson who has my full support who i believe is doing a great job and will lead us to the next federal election
7693205 i took him at his word at that and my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics
7693206 but he will make his position clear i suspect in the next two or three weeks
7693207 theres no leadership hassle going on in the party at all
7693208 brendan nelson is doing a fantastic job and i dont think its necessary at this stage we have a lot of talent in the liberal party federally
7693209 i am a big supporter of brendans and i want him to stay there
7693210 peter said after the last election that he was going to go and start another life i took him at his word
7693211 i think brendan nelsons leadership is fantastic brendan nelson is man who is continuing to take the fight up to the labor party
7693212 what is very clear is that there isnt any economic leadership
7693213 thats a matter for people wearing a different coloured uniform to me
7693214 what i know very much as do many of these athletes is that its a very tough competitive business that im in as well
7693215 and my job is to earn peoples respect between now and 2010 the next federal election
7693216 obviously we cant go to an election like that but were not there yet
7693217 were only about a third of the way through the first term
7693218 i truly believe that peter has incredible economic credentials and its not for peter but its for our nation that he should be on the front bench
7693219 but if he doesnt have an intention that way he should declare it as such
7693220 brendan has the support of the party room and thats the beginning of it and thats the end of it
7693221 i think peter costello is entitled to determine when he leaves parliament
7693222 hes been a great servant of the australian people and if he stays good
7693223 if he decides to move on he will also have the best wishes of his colleagues
7693224 always want to win and were always backing the attitude that weve got to win because the alternative is not worth having
7693225 se sentido no direito de n o apenas interpretar a lei mas de fazer a lei
7693226 onde j se viu o judici rio dizer que um parlamentar ou n o infiel a seu partido isso assunto do legislativo o judici rio n o poderia fazer o que est fazendo ele resolveu aqui acol a legislar porque entra no v cuo do legislativo
7693227 ou o legislativo se levanta e reage ou se invade a compet ncia dele
7693228 para mim essa hist ria de cotas n o deve nem ser mencionada ela beira o rid culo
7693229 imagine ter uma cota para poder contratar dois sobrinhos e tr s tios pelo amor de deus
7693230 enforcement of homicide laws against pregnant women restricting the activities of pregnant women outlawing contraception and so on
7693231 the big picture is that the human life amendment creates uncertainty in the law leaving it up to future legislatures to establish implementing laws and up to enforcement officials and courts to sort out what the law might mean in various applications
7693232 there are some forms of birth control that really are the destruction of a fertilized egg
7693233 yeah i personally think there are better ways to deal with contraception than destroying a human life so again im going to say that im always going to make my position on the side of protecting human life
7693234 how great is this the national black republican association is running 50 billboards across lunatic central denver host to the dnc how many people know martin luther king was a republican or that the republican party was the party of the abolition of slavery or that the republicans were the party of civil rights check out some of these leading lights of the gop through american history
7693235 several sources from north korea report that irrespective of rank the trend of listening to foreign radio broadcasts is expanding among officials of the party the administration or the national security agency even the rank and file servants
7693236 we will not be going in for the rest of the week
7693237 if you had a periscope to see over the tent you could see the people entering the pepsi center
7693238 if you think you might be violating the terms then you probably are
7693239 if you think you might be violating the terms then gt you probably are
7693240 were not going to renew it that shouldnt come as a surprise
7693241 we oppose discrimination i think weve got strong federal and state laws that protect our people
7693242 thank you for continueing to hold your call is very important to us a representative will be with you shortly
7693243 graphic organizers are a useful tool for students as they learn to read write and do math they help students visually connect their thoughts and ideas and organize information to easily understand it graphic organizers also guide and direct students as they apply strategies and processes to reading writing and math graphic organizers are also a useful tool for instructors and tutors they provide a visual representation of how the student thinks processes information and applies information to different situations the tutor can use this to inform and target instruction as well as to document progress
7693244 sometimes i feel just like a gerbil running around and around on his wheel
7693245 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7693246 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7693247 will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7693248 i dont think any georgian government can accept losing those territories
7693249 absolutely in the future this is a recipe for future clashes if it is accepted by the russian government sooner or later the fighting will re erupt
7693250 recognition by russia of the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia is the necessary condition for ensuring the security of these peoples
7693251 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever be one state with georgia again
7693252 the people of south ossetia and abkhazia have made their choice in life and they have made up their minds about with whom they should be and build their economic and political relations
7693253 a very strong signal to the west that were very serious
7693254 if youre not ready to give guarantees to the abkhazians and ossetians of peace and stability in the region we will recognize them
7693255 if the west is ready to give these guarantees russia will not recognize them
7693256 only see these guarantees as real if russians take part
7693257 you wanna make god laugh tell him your plans for the future
7693258 diversity in paris we do not even really know what this diversity is for us it would be insulting to draw attention to someones differences everyone should be treated the same and that is how we operate
7693259 in paris they are fine with you having a baby just as long as they dont know that you had a baby it should be as if nothing has changed but the reality you see for mothers is that everything has changed
7693260 there are very few women attorneys that make partner because if you want to have children if is difficult for you to continue to work at the rate that you need to also if you continue to work it is looked on as if your husband does not have a good enough job to support you
7693261 this technology provides an invaluable new tool for dss to meet the needs of the children and families we serve in the office of community services ocs
7693262 each day we strive to protect our most vulnerable children and build stronger families it is an honor to be acknowledged for offering innovative and creative tools which continually improve our services
7693263 this system supports our vision goals and objectives by providing our management team and our front line workers the tools to provide stability for these fragile children within a familiar environment
7693264 it also allows us to track trends and patterns in child welfare to help us make informed decisions and increase efficiency
7693265 ia pernah terlibat dalam persaingan gelar juara dan kini juga ambil bagian saya yakin ia banyak belajar dari hal ini seperti yang sudah ia lakukan sebelumnya
7693266 kami khawatir dengan bagaimana ia bertahan terhadap masalah tersebut dan lewis membuktikan ia bisa mengatasinya dengan baik
7693267 we are essentially mimicking what happens in the body when scavenger cells remove dead and abnormal cells
7693268 if the dead cells are not removed then this affects how healthy cells behave
7693269 not only will this make the production of drugs more efficient but it will also streamline research into new medicines which use cell culture
7693270 jadi ini terlalu dini lagi pula ini juga belum pasti mengenai berapa persen syarat calon presiden untuk mengikuti pemilu
7693271 saya kira partai partai tengah yang membangun koalisi yang tidak berdasarkan pada kesamaan ideologi maka akan cenderung pragmatis sehingga tidak ada konsesi konsesi politik yang tercapai
7693272 this reflects much tougher trading conditions for business and professional firms after a period when business trends had been holding up in the face of the slowing economy
7693273 oh please i did it on my show first with claudia but you know what theres not going to be a moment where tyra banks is not going to knock me off so im not bothered by her
7693274 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
7693275 i think this is a great place to get a little attention on what no child left behind is doing to our kids and to our teachers
7693276 i just slapped it together with some glue and put it on
7693277 do not think that this year is your final year
7693278 in other words imagine that in addition to this year another four years will be under your management and plan and act accordingly
7693279 i feel infuriated whenever i hear him talking on state television
7693280 he speaks in an immature way he has no economic or political plan for the country
7693281 this has nothing to do with sanctions it was just ahmadinejads mismanagement
7693282 he is giving money to the poor but they have seen no improvement in their living conditions real estate prices have jumped and the poor are getting poorer
7693283 tasc takes copyright compliance very seriously and has cooperated fully and openly with the bsa

7693286 i have never experienced a situation like this being two months without kicking a ball i just want to be fully recovered
7693287 i am not used to being sidelined i feel sad but the worst moment has already gone and i recognise that i must be patient i feel well and the time of kicking a ball is coming playing football this is what makes me happy
7693288 i think that i had a very positive campaign last season it would be a dream that becomes reality to win it i believe i can win it this year
7693289 target such businesses with predictable recurring cash flows with a value that could be monetised to return capital to shareholders
7693290 this means it is more interested in maximising profits and operating for short term gain than providing long term care for the most vulnerable
7693291 the important thing is for him to be happy and im happy for him
7693292 at chelsea he certainly wasnt happy during two seasons and with three different coaches in charge
7693293 someone like him who returns home does so with a lot of motivation
7693294 my father was a shift worker a worker for the city all his life
7693295 no silver spoons no magic just parents who tried their best to leave the next generation just a little bit better off i think our stories are the quintessential american stories
7693296 will demonstrate to all americans why we need barack obama and joe biden his vice presidential running mate in the white house
7693297 youll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how were raising our kids and i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7693298 i do think it has settled into a different phase on the channel when you think of big brother from series one and two it was at its most pioneering
7693299 there was a frenzy around the first couple of series but you cant keep replicating that it is now settling into a different period it is our post watershed soap and that is fantastic we have got to move on from contrasting it with big brother one and two
7693300 in all likelihood it feels like it has settled into a rhythm are we likely to get 10 million viewers again that is going to be a tough call
7693301 big brother is still an incredibly important show for us it still gets twice the audience of the slot average
7693302 it has two more years on its current contract and it all depends on what happens after that as long as it continues to be as robust as it is we will have it on the channel
7693303 i feel genuinely sorry that carol is leaving the show and that terms couldnt be agreed
7693304 she has been a really big star for channel 4 and countdown and genuinely she will be sorely missed i hope we will do something else with her in the future
7693305 the advertising recession is absolutely here now and we are all feeling the pinch
7693306 we are going to have to cut our cloth accordingly this year and next it is getting tougher there is no question about it
7693307 there will have to be some savings how much will slightly depend on how things pan out
7693308 zardari becoming the president would be the most unfortunate event in pakistans history
7693309 a thug is going to be the president of this country
7693310 we have no options ahead of us once again they are taking turns in power this is zardaris turn after that it will be nawazs turn he is equally irresponsible and corrupt
7693311 it was an unnatural alliance and it has reached its natural end
7693312 you have to create national consciousness among the majority of the people
7693313 thanks for the nice piece on aep in todays publication you explained it correctly really got it right in my experience thats all too rare among even the most professional of journalists
7693314 these intense rains may produce life threatening flash floods and mudslides
7693315 if you thought you couldnt afford a hasselblad think again
7693316 if apple applied ssl encryption in the browser it would only slow down every data exchange without really improving security and instead only provide pundits with a false sense of security that distracts from real security threats
7693317 by 2020 we might have nine billion people on the planet we could have a very big middle class driving millions more cars and we could be in a really resource hungry world with the oil price climbing and a supply situation in libya russia and saudi where natural gas is limited
7693318 it is those drivers those conditions which will encourage the possibility of landfill mining
7693319 once plastic is in a landfill site it pretty much sits there doing nothing and the beauty of that is that youre able to go back and recapture it in the future
7693320 there are some really buoyant prices around because plastic is all manufactured from oil so as the raw price of oil goes up every commodity derived from it goes up accordingly
7693321 over a period of a very long time many decades we have had a policy of burying whatever we can in landfill sites so there are valuable resources in those sites
7693322 and wherever there are valuable resources there is always the temptation to investigate whether its worth recovering them the logic is sound but the practicalities are complex and you have to balance those out with the commercial viability
7693323 several pilot studies have been carried out for research or pre feasibility studies in countries in europe but also in china japan and india
7693324 for example landfills in sweden dating from the 1960s have a lot of waste building material reflecting the construction boom of that era
7693325 and other landfills have very specific waste like those used by vehicle breakers which have high concentrations of aluminium copper and iron scrap
7693326 the value of these materials varies daily with global market prices and today there is considerable demand for scrap metal from china for instance
7693327 just imagine the resources that are lying in those landfills it could be incredible
7693328 gee i sure wish i could have kept working with all that uncertainty hanging over me
7693329 mam e mam e n o quero mais brincar de boneca quero levantar peso

7693344 for a compact fluorescent bulb to achieve the claimed efficiency it has to be burned continuously for long periods if a cfl is left on for only 5 minute periods it will burn out just as fast as an incandescent bulb to avoid short cycling the u s energy star program advises consumers to leave compact fluorescents on for at least 15 minutes cfls contain toxic mercury and cannot be thrown into the trash but have to be recycled cfls become dimmer as they age and thus again will not perform as advertised the quality of light from fluorescent bulbs is inferior to incandescent standard cfls wont operate at low temperatures and are thus unsuitable for many outdoor applications

7693373 if we are able to show and prove that this concert is actually sponsored by you by philip morris then we will truly train our guns on you for clearly violating the law
7693374 the company already knew when the prohibition would take effect so if they will try to circumvent that by saying we signed the contract before that will not be acceptable
7693375 with their prestige they should disassociate themselves to tobacco products which have no value or use they should heed the law and bring the youth to other productive activities tobacco products should not be promoted
7693376 considered one of the most influential bands in the country the eraserheads has become a role model of sorts for our young i hope they will rise up to the challenge do more than play music and help young filipinos reach their potential
7693377 you should live every day like it would be your last and theres not that many people who do
7693378 its a credit to dave he didnt have enough days but he lived them like he should have
7693379 how can you make sure you fill it with the most fun and that you visit all the coolest places on earth before you pack those bags for the very last time
7693380 it wasnt just physical adventure it was cultural adventure and spiritual adventure such as a voodoo pilgrimage in haiti

7693382 secretly theyre full of fireworks and dynamite at the stroke of midnight they light them all on fire in a huge loud pyromania display
7693383 we would try to have odd combinations of logos such as gluttony and grandma approved on the same thing
7693384 the icons gave the book a lot of life and people really reacted to the categories which are kind of a snapshot into daves brain
7693385 amazingly fabulous at what he did which was living big but also as a business strategist and cultural anthropologist
7693386 were going to the future do you want to come along it always made everybody laugh
7693387 tinsley 41 is a former employee of the company having worked as a reporter for the plano star courier and the lewisville leader for several years in the mid 1990s
7693388 tinsley who has won various writing awards during his time as a reporter has nearly 20 years of experience as a journalist
7693389 the 1991 graduate of tarleton state university in stephenville texas comes from a journalism and writing family
7693390 his father jack b tinsley led the fort worth star telegram to two pulitzer prizes as its executive editor in the 1980s
7693391 the precise amount of losses that may be incurred on these securities for the third quarter is difficult to determine given the significant volatility being experienced in the market values of these securities
7693392 i have noticed more schmucks wearing a v neck with a tie
7693393 very little chest hair good tan amp nice ankles so i can get away with no socks
7693394 custom fits you in a hotel room it used to be that the only way you could talk to a chevron products trader in person was at a titty bar or in the hong kong guys hotel room while you waitied on your suit measurement
7693395 i think they zimbabweans are looking forward to a very explosive parliament now that the speaker and the deputy speaker of parliament are coming from the opposition party so we are waiting to see how the business of parliament will proceed
7693396 my assumption would be now that the speaker of parliament and theyve got deputy speaker of parliament maybe they opposition have got a strategy to control parliament to control mugabe and make sure that they control the businesses of parliament
7693397 i think the issue of speaker of parliament complicates the whole thing for mdc to boycott or to participate in the parliament business
7693398 i think zanu pf thought they were going to lets say win the speaker of parliament through the other mdc faction i think they were well beaten and they are shocked as a result if you look at how the zanu pf mps members of parliament came in their numbers to parliament to vote and they were thinking that they will vote with the smaller faction i think they were not expecting this result and i dont think they zanu pf have got any plans they are confused they are paralyzed they are shocked and they dont know what to do
7693399 this shows that mugabe is not sincere about the ongoing peace talks and it also shows that zanu pf is not ashamed to do anything to the extent of arresting the mps when they were coming in for the swearing in ceremony and the move was designed to influence the voting patterns for the speaker of parliament
7693400 to be able to see one of those close down instead of just taking dogs theyve sold has been a dream come true for me
7693401 i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7693402 the survey results would suggest that anwar will not lose but he may not do exceptionally well either

7693409 this is an incredibly neat use of google earth this is a study we would not have dreamed about doing five years ago
7693410 sung kim last week had very detailed and substantive discussions with his north korean counterpart and on the subject of verification
7693411 what i would say to you is that i would not make too much out of this meeting that took place
7693412 wants to see this verification package as soon as possible so that we can move forward with this delisting
7693413 im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
7693414 people know that i can give the kind of speech that i gave four years ago thats not the question on voters mind i think theyre much more interested in what am i going to do to help them in their lives
7693415 and so in that sense this is going to be a more workman like speech

7693487 your station is committed to operating in the public interest an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity
7693488 knowing and willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law
7693489 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old

7693508 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7693509 when i met obama i realized that hes the same person face to face that he is when speaking to an audience of thousands

7693517 many are coming our way it will take a little longer

7693651 yes maam the childrens showings are at 5 30 and 6 45 no children are allowed in the theater after the 6 45 showing
7693652 i do not understand how people can expect children to be perfect at all times to just sit there perfectly quiet while you watch a movie
7693653 my children are a part of my life and i will include them as such
7693654 when other people are in the same situation but do not remove the child sure i am get a little miffed but i dont blame the child for goodness sake
7693655 should we also ask people who are cough breathe a little heavy or even have an annoying laugh to also leave the theater
7693656 perhaps we should have movies without blacks women because we all know how crazy and emotional they can get or maybe no old people because they have to keep getting up to go to the bathroom or maybe no rednecks because theyre not going to understand the movie anyway
7693657 many people think of glass as a commodity product but when you consider its relative abundance functionality and high performance coating technologies you begin to understand its value as a highly functional building material

7693659 the arc of history is long but it bends toward justice
7693660 theres a lot of people already speaking on behalf of consumers and what they may or may not do
7693661 when it comes to food consumers vote with their wallets at checkout not on public opinion surveys id really like to see someone step up and offer consumers the choice there have been enough serious outbreaks of foodborne illness in fresh produce that the interest in irradiated spinach and lettuce should be strong
7693662 retailers have both the clout to compel high standards and better tracking in agriculture and a direct reason to worry about consumers concerns
7693663 the wal marts and mcdonalds of the world have been requiring enhanced food safety from their suppliers for more than a decade and as your editorial notes they may be the best advocates for consumers making customers sick is bad business

7693666 the former president is disappointed associates said because he is eager to speak about the economy and more broadly about democratic ideas emphasizing the contrast between the bush years and his own record in the 1990s
7693667 this is an especially sore point for bill clinton people close to him say because among many grievances he has about the campaign obama waged against his wife is a belief that the candidate poor mouthed the political and policy successes of his two terms
7693668 one senior obama supporter said the clinton associates negotiating on her behalf act like japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7693669 by 2020 we might have nine billion people on the planet we could have a very big middle class driving millions more cars and we could be in a really resource hungry world with the oil price climbing and a supply situation in libya russia and saudi where natural gas is limited
7693670 it is those drivers those conditions which will encourage the possibility of landfill mining
7693671 maybe we are a little bit crazy maybe we are just bored

7693678 cats are the only animal species that can spread toxoplasma in their stool shedding rates in cats are quite low but can be higher in cats that go outside hunt or are fed raw meat however it takes 24 hours or more for toxoplasma in stool to be infectious that means that fresh stool cannot spread toxoplasma that key point greatly reduces the risk of transmission from cats

7693684 the roads are in a mess and we are canceling school tomorrow and wednesday which is a half day for professional development anyway we hate to cancel school but we are focusing on our kids safety
7693685 all our facilities had some water on the floor but that is the result of 20 plus inches of rain in a 24 hour period
7693686 all the routes we use appear to be clear at this time
7693687 we know to expect more rain however between now and in the morning so if conditions worsen beyond just continuous rain we may end up changing that decision
7693688 there were a few roads still a little questionable so our resource officer checked those out
7693689 there are a couple of places where bus drivers may contact some families about arranging a safe pick up location but we feel it will be fine to resume classes tomorrow

7693697 the main reason behind fridays move was the same as what took prices higher in the first place the dollar
7693698 fridays about face in the greenback spurred broad based sell offs in a number of other commodity complexes besides energy
7693699 being driven by the dollar and central bank policy and issues like war and supply demand take a back seat
7693700 we could see further weakness gnaw at the markets over the next few weeks as weaker demand aggravates the excess supply problem

7693704 the slowdown in housing starts has been very painful for the industry but it is the necessary medicine to work down the inventory of unsold homes
7693705 we need for sales to outpace production so we can work down these inventories thats what has to happen before we can get this thing back on track
7693706 we know the moment you find something thats more suitable to your needs youre gone
7693707 tonight monday through tuesday morning we are expecting 1 to 3 inches but overall for the storm it could be as much as 3 to 6 inches
7693708 the heaviest rain should persist through tuesday morning and taper off after noon
7693709 once it gets going its supposed to be here for 36 hours
7693710 if its rained a lot in the past few hours watch out for any rising creeks throughout the area be very careful when driving on a road that has water standing it just takes a couple of inches to get your car off the road and start going somewhere you dont want to go

7693720 utterly vapid devoid of context frequently wrong and wedded to narratives that defy all logic and reality
7693721 liberals believe that they cant get a fair shake from the media anymore
7693722 thats an exact mirror of what the right did with talk radio
7693723 corrupted by their need to be part of the establishment
7693724 one of the hallmarks of netroots culture was a complete disconnect from history meaning basically anything that had happened before 1998
7693725 i wonder if we gave more benefits to those coming here legally if that might not encourage more to do it the right way
7693726 it looks to me that it would be governor minner unless we go into the january 20 scenario
7693727 if the loser is carney its very easy to see governor minner who has endorsed him as her successor appointing him if he would like that office its a little harder to see if the loser is jack markell
7693728 i spent as much time with cindy in washington and arizona as our jobs would allow

7693740 there was a concern about the increased cost to carriers we accommodated that by reducing the speed zones
7693741 its disappointing that it cant be all that it could be
7693742 if we didnt lose one or two females a year
7693743 we want the speed to be slow enough so that the whales have a chance to get out of the way or the blow will be a glancing blow and they will survive

7693746 she was one of those players who we immediately trusted and it gave us flexibility swallen said
7693747 a lot of time with young players you have to get them seasoned the game is a little faster game but she was ready to play the first game she scored a goal she was one of the those players we wanted to get the ball to because the right things happen
7693748 it seemed like the seniors were all so much bigger than the freshman she said
7693749 it has gone by so fast it doesnt seem like i should be a senior and i dont seem that much bigger than the freshmen
7693750 she distributes the ball she has great vision swallen said
7693751 if we need her to go forward she will do that she kind of does everything we want her to touch the ball as much as possible being a midfielder allows her to dictate the course of the game
7693752 shes the type of kid who wants to be the best at everything swallen said
7693753 shes that way in the classroom taking all accelerated classes everything she does all day is always high end

7693759 if it worked over there and most of the conditions are similar and other factors can be controlled then there we can be confident that it will work over here
7693760 the students are here we need more seats for them our budget is already bare bones we need help from the community from voters to open redtail school

7693776 we want voters to know that john mccain is unfriendly to women
7693777 has voted against womens reproductive rights and privacy 125 times
7693778 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
7693779 were trying to figure out what these guys had in mind
7693780 never consider ever consider allowing a supporter of his to challenge his opponent s right to be on the ballot in all 50 states
7693781 lets not have the kind of stalinist politics that the state of new york the republican party has been practicing
7693782 this move by the mccain campaign completely contradicts everything john mccain stood for in 2000 when his competitors were trying to keep him off the ballot
7693783 mccain has become a part of the same corrupted machine he spoke vehemently against only eight years ago
7693784 this is america where people have a right to run for office and a right to compete for the chance to lead the people of this nation
7693785 i look forward to the chance to compete fairly against senator mccain for votes in pennsylvania and every other state
7693786 you might expect of a dictator in north korea libya china or iran
7693787 this move is certainly one of the more brazen attempts to lock me out of the political process
7693788 but it is simply just one more example of how the political establishment desperately clings to their own power instead of empowering the people the political establishment serves only themselves and not the people of this nation it is time candidates for the most powerful position in the world compete based on ideas and not dirty politics
7693789 i challenge senator mccain to forcefully and publicly instruct his agents to drop the lawsuit
7693790 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7693791 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7693792 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7693793 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7693794 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7693795 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7693796 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7693797 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7693798 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7693799 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7693800 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7693801 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7693802 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7693803 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7693804 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7693805 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7693806 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7693807 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7693808 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7693809 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7693810 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7693811 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

7693817 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7693818 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7693819 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7693820 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7693821 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part

7693824 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
7693825 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7693826 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7693827 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7693828 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7693829 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7693830 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7693831 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7693832 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7693833 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7693834 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7693835 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7693836 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7693837 this is a planning took where all things are going
7693838 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7693839 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7693840 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7693841 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7693842 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7693843 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7693844 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7693845 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7693846 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7693847 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7693848 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7693849 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7693850 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7693851 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7693852 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7693853 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7693854 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7693855 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7693856 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7693857 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7693858 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7693859 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7693860 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7693861 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7693862 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7693863 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7693864 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7693865 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7693866 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7693867 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7693868 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7693869 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7693870 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7693871 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7693872 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7693873 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7693874 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7693875 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7693876 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7693877 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7693878 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7693879 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7693880 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7693881 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7693882 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7693883 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7693884 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7693885 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7693886 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7693887 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7693888 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7693889 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7693890 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7693891 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7693892 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7693893 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7693894 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7693895 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7693896 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7693897 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7693898 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7693899 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7693900 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7693901 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7693902 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7693903 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7693904 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7693905 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7693906 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7693907 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7693908 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7693909 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7693910 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7693911 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7693912 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7693913 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7693914 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7693915 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7693916 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7693917 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7693918 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7693919 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7693920 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7693921 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7693922 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7693923 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7693924 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7693925 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7693926 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7693927 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7693928 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7693929 bryan en a vu dautres dans cette ligue et il a t un bon d fenseur pendant plusieurs ann es a d clar le directeur g n ral des flyers paul holmgren dans un communiqu je suis enthousiaste lid e de le voir essayer de faire sa niche avec nous a ne fera quaugmenter le niveau de comp tition au camp
7693930 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7693931 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7693932 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7693933 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7693934 no one works for someone we all just work together
7693935 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7693936 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7693937 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7693938 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7693939 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7693940 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7693941 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7693942 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7693943 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7693944 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7693945 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7693946 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7693947 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7693948 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7693949 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7693950 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7693951 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7693952 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7693953 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7693954 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7693955 eventually theyll have to start sweeping a couple of series but i think the minimums got to be two out of three
7693956 do not wait the time will never be just right start where you stand and work with whatever tools you may have at your command and better tools will be found as you go along
7693957 this is an important milestone for a project that will enable our company and our community to further tap into the luxury travel market
7693958 working together for the first time walt disney world resort and four seasons hotels and resorts will create a world class family resort destination that offers the exceptional service and amenities and one of a kind guest experiences that are the hallmark of both our brands
7693959 this project is one with which we are proud to be associated
7693960 having memorable family vacation experiences are more important than ever to our guests and we are excited about working with disney to create a unique product in central florida
7693961 look upon your hands they are stained with the blood of your relations
7693962 high school hoops season last year hes 225 pounds now hes over 250 with a lot of room to gropw he obviously spent a lot of time in the weight room working his butt off to get himself some bulk and size hes been better than adequate at point of attack which is probably a little more than what i was expecting
7693963 big body 265 pounds nice solid blocker very soft hands but kyle runs vertically down the field pretty fast
7693964 going into camp to be honest with you i wasnt so positive he was going to win the job
7693965 and he won it convincingly he did everything well he showed could pass block he showed he could block at the point of attack he showed he wasnt a liability when you put him on an island
7693966 thats a concern when you have a left tackle you can chip help blocking on the blindside all day but if you get where the tackle can play in the game without blocking help that allows you to get more guys in patterns
7693967 one guy that looks like he has the promise to be best of all of them is freshman and former st rita star darius fleming
7693968 but hes got a lot of things on his mind right here between pass rushing and special teams
7693969 we cant go to the game i asked about that by the way
7693970 no one from the athletic department can go which was the next thing
7693971 if they convey that sense of passion and focus and they bring their own stories into it the issues will take care of themselves
7693972 but too often democrats think its an intellectual debate about policy nuances that aint it and thats why weve lost in the past sometimes weve got to make sure people understand who these people are
7693973 theyre not going to listen to much on issues unless they feel that they know both of these candidates
7693974 uansett s h rer han jo ikke s hva er vitsen
7693975 social networking is not restricted to the confines of the pc browser in india mobile phones are the preferred and mostly the sole means of connecting with friends and family this year we are all set to refine and redefine the boundaries of social networking in india this will be a major departure for users of social networks from being an occasional visitor to now proactively driving their networks

7693978 please walk over to them and kindly ask them to request their childs silence
7693979 yes maam the childrens showings are at 5 30 and 6 45 no children are allowed in the theater after the 6 45 showing
7693980 i do not understand how people can expect children to be perfect at all times to just sit there perfectly quiet while you watch a movie
7693981 my children are a part of my life and i will include them as such
7693982 when other people are in the same situation but do not remove the child sure i am get a little miffed but i dont blame the child for goodness sake
7693983 should we also ask people who are cough breathe a little heavy or even have an annoying laugh to also leave the theater
7693984 perhaps we should have movies without blacks women because we all know how crazy and emotional they can get or maybe no old people because they have to keep getting up to go to the bathroom or maybe no rednecks because theyre not going to understand the movie anyway

7693987 hopefully now the malls will understand that they do have to accommodate criticism of the tenants stores and themselves
7693988 customers complain all the time about people who interfere with their shopping experience
7693989 sometimes you have to wonder how many judges are out there at shopping centers experiencing some of this stuff
7693990 macerichs hostility toward messages critical of the mall or its tenants
7693991 attempts to elevate expressive rights under california law at the expense of state property rights
7693992 everyone was saying what did i think about the rumours

7693995 im tired of hearing yall talk why dont yall just be like nike and just do it
7693996 new and dramatic developments this is a heads up ill post the news monday morning by 0900 hours now i know why people who have seen the videotape say it is stunning baracks headaches are only starting
7693997 theres a buzz which i believe now to be credible that some indelible record exists
7693998 the michelle obama rant tape was filmed between june 26th july 1st 2004 in chicago il at the rainbow push coalition conference at trinity united church specifically the womens event
7693999 barack has been talking down to black people i want to cut his nuts off
7694000 my support for senator obamas campaign is wide deep and unequivocal i cherish this redemptive and historical moment my appeal was for the moral content of his message to not only deal with the personal and moral responsibility of black males but to deal with the collective moral responsibility of government and the public policy which would be a corrective action for the lack of good choices that often led to their irresponsibility
7694001 im deeply outraged and disappointed in reverend jacksons reckless statements about senator barack obama his divisive and demeaning comments about the presumptive democratic nominee and i believe the next president of the united states contradict his inspiring and courageous career
7694002 reverend jackson is my dad and ill always love him
7694003 he should know how hard that ive worked for the last year and a half as a national co chair of barack obamas presidential campaign so i thoroughly reject and repudiate his ugly rhetoric he should keep hope alive and any personal attacks and insults to himself
7694004 im confident in the strength of our party as we work to elect barack obama our next president and win seats up and down the ticket
7694005 i think this is an important time for our country
7694006 were facing a terrible economic downturn we have high gasoline prices we have problems in our foreign policy thats why i think its important
7694007 i m a nigger hes a nigger shes a nigger we some niggers wouldnt you like to be a nigger too to all my kike niggers spic niggers guinea niggers chink niggers thats right yall my niggers too

7694012 is there a link between the pollution and my cancer
7694013 i dont know but the government has known about the rhones pollution for a very long time
7694014 we have seen this before there is dirt and lies that are circulated in e mails and they pump them out long enough until finally you a mainstream reporter asks me about it
7694015 that gives legs to the story if somebody has evidence that myself or michelle or anybody has said something inappropriate let them do it
7694016 were relying on the weakest governments to provide systems to the most vulnerable
7694017 weve had an anti urban anti city president for eight years
7694018 for our cities to be as vibrant as they can be were going to have to focus on public safety
7694019 we want to be as tough on crime as we are on the root causes of crime
7694020 im just looking forward to the challenge of playing the biggest and the best that we can
7694021 weve got that on our calendars were ready for that game
7694022 hillary clinton is well known certainly she had the popular vote in this election
7694023 that is something and that is something tremendous now i believe the vice presidential nomination is up to obama i cant tell him what to do nobody else can tell him what to do all i can say is i agree with the pennsylvania gov ed rendell that if you really want a winning ticket this is it
7694024 i endorse him and throw my full support behind him and i ask of you to join me in working as hard for barack obama as you have for me youll always find me on the front lines of democracy fighting for the future
7694025 obviously i am thrilled and honored to have sen clintons support but more than that i honor her today for the valiant and historic campaign she has run she shattered barriers on behalf of my daughters and women everywhere who now know that there are no limits to their dreams and she inspired millions with her strength courage and unyielding commitment to the cause of working americans
7694026 that speech cannot be seen as anything but a slight

7694038 the appeal of stone soup is that this deep area may collect and concentrate different kinds of materials
7694039 the trough between polygons is sort of a trap where things can accumulate
7694040 over a long timescale there may even be circulation of material sinking at the margins and rising at the center
7694041 we had a shootout between stone soup and white stuff in a trench called upper cupboard
7694042 if we had been able to confirm that the white material was a salt rich deposit we would have analyzed that but we were unable to confirm that with various methods
7694043 transpacific evolution i e macroevolution is nothing but an extrapolation and magnification of the events that take place within populations and species
7694044 the debate between creationism and darwinism is often depicted as a dispute between naive biblical literalists who ignore the overwhelming evidence for evolution and scientifically enlightened intellectuals but this is a caricature that serves the purpose of helping to perpetuate a world view hostile to christian faith atheistic naturalism

7694074 we have a feeling that they have split up and went different ways from finding some of the jumpsuits throughout the city
7694075 are looking at every family and background friend of the suspects and they will continue to do that until they hopefully capture these individuals
7694076 to get tunnel vision on where one suspect might be going we could actually miss the lead on another one
7694077 i cant comment on went wrong at this time if anything went wrong at all
7694078 the escapees are more of a threat right now than how they did it or how they got up to the roof
7694079 i understand we werent playing well as a defence and linebacker mike oshea and i are leaders of that defence and when theyre not performing you have to be held accountable
7694080 but i never thought id be released i thought we were in this thing together this isnt any spot that we havent been in as far as record wise but again whatever their reasons are
7694081 i know i had the respect of the players in the locker room when you get voted a captain by your peers not by your coaches that speaks volumes i know i can still play its not a matter of that im not the first person that this has happened to and i wont be the last it is what it is whatever
7694082 whether i said the right things or made one more play or i didnt make it the decisions been made
7694083 i dont have any expectations i know i can help somebody im just caught a little off guard but im not surprised ive played 12 years and ive seen this happen time and time again its not just me its the way it works so im not surprised at the business side of it but personally im caught off guard normally if youre not playing well you get demoted but when you get released youre doing something generally wrong i guess something was wrong
7694084 all i can say is with pinball clemons as the head coach and stubler as the defensive co ordinator and now kavis reed is the defensive co ordinator and stubler is the head coach things are different definitely different
7694085 and im not commenting that theyre better or worse but theyre definitely different as they would be with any dynamic of new players

7694100 america was never innocent we popped our cherry on the boat over and looked back with no regrets you cant ascribe our fall from grace to any single event or set of circumstances you cant lose what you lacked at conception
7694101 mass market nostalgia gets you hopped up for a past that never existed hagiography sanctifies shuck and jive politicians and reinvents their expedient gestures as moments of great moral weight our continuing narrative line is blurred past truth and hindsight only a reckless verisimilitude can set that line straight

7694154 i love playing football and anytime i get a chance to get out and make any kind of play on either side of the ball its fun i love what i do
7694155 i guess im just trying to literally learn every day and hopefully make some plays whenever i get a chance
7694156 we used ray last year on the practice squad to run routes for the defense as an offensive receiver and he really did a good job
7694157 i think he can play both receiver and defensive back at a competent level
7694158 he is a tough kid he runs hard he catches the ball well and he showed up in the kicking game his versatility is his number one strength at this point but when he does play he has been productive in defense special teams and offense he is a unique guy
7694159 i dont think you can worry about all the stuff you cant control

7694162 ive heard complaints from a handful of constituents but ive also had calls from people in the health care profession complaining
7694163 the medical professionals who have come to me are accusing the university of dumping patients on its neighboring institutions whether its being implemented in the way thats in the best interest of the patient i cant tell you
7694164 was running a campaign to cut coverage for the poor
7694165 in the past we opened our doors and saw whoever came
7694166 we would see a patient who had general pneumonia and if we needed to see a patient who needed a liver transplant that liver transplant patient couldnt get in the door
7694167 we were taking general patients away from mercy hospital michael reese and they were financially at risk
7694168 we harmed other hospitals without knowing we harmed other hospitals
7694169 the collapse of the health care system was driving more and more people to the emergency room
7694170 the trend line was and is a disastrous one from the standpoint of maintaining the hospital their goal was to find an answer
7694171 of course why not if there is a suspension of military cooperation this is military cooperation
7694172 no one with common sense can expect to cooperate with russia in one part of the world while acting against it in another
7694173 its not in russias interests for nato to be defeated and leave behind all these problems
7694174 wed prefer nato to complete its job and then leave this unnatural geography

7694177 we did a survey of bat carers and tested them and none showed any exposure to the hendra virus
7694178 bats wont be culled they are a protected species and are an important part of the ecosystem
7694179 we are far better looking at how horses catch the virus
7694180 we are studying how the virus travels in bat populations and how it is related to the reproductive cycle
7694181 it would mean for example in this current financial year a surplus of 20 billion instead of 21 5 billion
7694182 lets not be lectured by the labor party about fiscal rectitude they have nothing to tell us
7694183 they certainly dont have a mandate for these completely unjustifiable tax increases
7694184 what the government is actually doing is taxing australians now in an unjustifiable way in order to spend it later in order to buy their way back into office in 2010
7694185 but we are not going to vote for tax increases that we dont think the government has made the case for that are unjustifiable and simply increase prices for ordinary australians
7694186 the july number that we just have hot off the press our internal inflation number in supermarkets in australia was 2 5 per cent mr luscombe said today

7694188 the july number that we just have hot off the press our internal inflation number in supermarkets in australia was 2 5 per cent mr luscombe said today
7694189 whilst we are pleased with the momentum in the business we are mindful that discretionary spending continues to be influenced by macro economic factors such as inflation fluctuating petrol prices interest rates and lower consumer confidence levels it said

7694196 flight centre starts the new financial year with significant momentum from 2007 08 a strong balance sheet and with foundations in place for further growth acting chief executive shannon obrien said
7694197 while we do not expect to replicate the 30 per cent to 40 per cent increases we have achieved in each of the past two years we will be disappointed if we do not increase pre tax profit by 10 to 15 per cent
7694198 flight centre continues to increase its scale in all countries while also developing a broader foundation mr obrien said
7694199 in addition to being one of the worlds leading leisure travel providers the company is now a significant and emerging presence in global corporate and wholesale travel

7694212 our performances are more about the art of burlesque we try to stay true to what burlesque was back in its heyday the sometimes frilly sometimes shiny and always sexy burlesque costumes help turn back the clock and bring back the pin up era if only during the performances whether its a fan dance a snake charmer skit a holiday inspired routine or the classic shimmy vintage burlesque groups like babes in sin are the intelligent alternative to the modern girls gone wild burlesque has more visual foreplay and as cha cha pictured right notes

7694228 we can simplify what they do back there much easier
7694229 the one that runs out there first it really doesnt matter
7694230 they are an obvious attempt to smear the senators character
7694231 most importantly however disclosure of the things of value and the negative repercussions flowing from that disclosure would have threatened the defendants future stream of things of value from veco bill allen and others
7694232 the government wishes to smuggle in suggestions of bribery and corruption that it has not charged and cannot prove

7694251 concerns the membership of the church because a true church can obviously only be made up of people who are regenerate and who display reformed lives observing the truth and living blamelessly before men
7694252 many took up the title of christian who were still profane superstitious carnal proud greedy luxurious indeed they rushed into the churches in crowds
7694253 from this influx it is not surprising that the doctrine of faith and most especially that of the new birth became so rapidly corrupted in the churches until at length christian church discipline was remodeled on the fashion of the pagan secular state
7694254 and so it came about that faith was neglected doctrine no longer studied regeneration equated to the mechanical performance of the rite of baptism by that time most of the world had taken up the christian profession so at length everything that had been instituted by christ was basely transmuted into another gospel

7694273 can you imagine the face of those in the board when that was said including his colleagues in government
7694274 the point here is that even if we have thats the public sentiment nobody likes to increases in electric rates nobody wants to pay for any increase thats the public sentiment
7694275 but why is it that the oil companies do not have the same do not have the kind of success we have in courts as meralco its something really that we have to seriously think about i think we have to come down to reality right now
7694276 our courts are the most corrupt at any point in time and i have been in practice for several years today its worse than five years ago its worst at its worst stage
7694277 and if its the most corrupt right now at this stage then meralco can also take advantage of that take advantage of this misfortune of this country if you want to survive i think thats to be blunt about it
7694278 its not a question anymore of whats the legal issue its a question of how to take advantage of this corrupt system your enemies our enemies have been taking advantage of this corrupt judicial system we have lets open up our eyes
7694279 the court of appeals is at its dirtiest right now
7694280 a lot of issues that have long confronted low wage workers are now increasingly facing middle income workers
7694281 i dont think we want to live in a country where people are working and doing what they are supposed to do but yet they cant get the basics
7694282 our company doesnt provide medical insurance i have to provide my own and i cannot find any that i can afford
7694283 as far as having a full blown checkup i have not had one in probably 10 to 15 years
7694284 weve had to cut back on things like going out to eat and shopping to make sure we have the necessities
7694285 we feel okay but you have to worry more than you used to
7694286 i might have to be forced to move back to texas
7694287 because i wont be able to afford to live in florida
7694288 i always say that the lord doesnt give you more than you can handle

7694290 the babys on wic the federal women infants and children program so we can afford our formula if i had to pay for everything wed barely be making it if we were making it at all
7694291 its still attainable just a little bit harder now at this time in the economy
7694292 but yeah everybody wants to be able to have their own house and family and be able to pay their bills and have a little extra money and you can still do it
7694293 the abcc is the last vestiges of howards unfair ir laws
7694294 no other workers in this country apart from workers in the construction industry are faced with this sort of heavy handed and undemocratic assault on their human rights
7694295 it started or a discussion started about a parallel campaign a complementary campaign to the overall your rights at work campaign
7694296 its a continuation of the campaign but its a different phase and applying some of the same techniques
7694297 we will be adhering to our election commitments including the abcc
7694298 we gave specific commitments that it would remain as it works now

7694321 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7694322 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7694323 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7694324 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7694325 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7694326 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7694327 talk about their life together and building a family grounded in faith and values

7694335 an 18 month old boy is in a critical condition in hospital with a serious head injury after what appears to be a tragic accident the toddler was playing with other young children in the garden of his home in the washwood heath area when he sustained a pellet wound to the back of the head from an air weapon
7694336 as a parent of three youngsters i know that beyond doubt this is every parents worst nightmare everyones prayers and thoughts should be with little rashid and his family they will be going through absolute hell
7694337 thankfully birmingham childrens hospital is among the best of its kind in the world ive had leaders at the very top of the nhs tell me that if their child fell ill there is nowhere they would rather have them looked after than birmingham childrens
7694338 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice
7694339 true religion will not let us fall asleep in the comfort of our freedom love thy neighbor is not a piece of advice its a command god my friends is with the poor and god is with us if we are with them this is not a burden this is an adventure

7694355 there were a a couple things we couldnt do in transformers due to budget but also because they seemed too out there to the studio some of those things we get to do in the second movie after we see it ill point out which
7694356 one of the themes is about the responsibilities you face when being away from home reflected by sam going to college and by the fact that the transformers themselves are of course far from cybertron
7694357 we were emulating the style of movie from the old amblin days like gremlins which if you watch today are still very funny also the cartoon itself was quite funny also comedy makes things more accessible to a larger audience
7694358 when they told me i was the judge i just didnt believe it i still dont believe it i dont even know what im doing here right now im just trying to enjoy it and trying to take it one day as it comes because it is a big change for me

7694365 by 2020 we might have nine billion people on the planet we could have a very big middle class driving millions more cars and we could be in a really resource hungry world with the oil price climbing and a supply situation in libya russia and saudi where natural gas is limited

7694368 port will be working in the firms pr department with mtvs cameras recording it all
7694369 all of you are aware of the serious nature of this years fire season and the issues faced by the agency in paying for fire suppression costs
7694370 at this time the only option for financing the shortfall is to use the agencys transfer authority
7694371 the unfortunate thing is that it is across the board
7694372 i recognize that this direction will have a significant effect on agency operations
7694373 however we must be in a position to protect life and property from wildfire and do so within the funds available to the agency
7694374 the fire season in montana and across the country is far from over not to mention we have good paying jobs to fund and projects around the state that need to be completed
7694375 funding should not be pulled from our states resources to help pay for fighting fires in california
7694376 the costs are high and they need to suppress these fires to protect people
7694377 but the forest service is basically becoming the fire service
7694378 he opened my mind and spirit to a broader world he took me to festivals museums and street fairs and taught me to stand up for what i believe
7694379 in these challenging times we need those skills of unwavering responsibility

7694381 not that he should have known the rules he did know
7694382 a unique technology that has not been applied successfully to an airplane
7694383 we only know the engine had problems and they did not make a successful landing
7694384 theres not a thing he can do at this point were working with the u s embassy to have all of the arrangements made for the repatriation of those who are deceased and medical flights for those living
7694385 there were farmers in the field where they crashed they pulled my husband out of the plane 30 seconds before the plane exploded
7694386 he has constant pain he says he can deal with hes just grateful to be alive
7694387 he did everything he was a carpenter a multipurpose utility player he was a very popular employee forever upbeat
7694388 he was very giving i think he was in africa last year
7694389 the air force has increased the sheer volume of pilots put through the training pipeline and shipped them off to war with the bare minimum training required
7694390 have come directly from basic training as their first exposure to the professional workforce
7694391 this is stuff we can correct through training stuff that happens between the ears
7694392 flight safety is of paramount importance to the air force and every mishap is carefully studied in order to mitigate future risk
7694393 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7694394 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7694395 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7694396 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7694397 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
7694398 we had a concern that this was going to happen
7694399 we are anxious to look at the information contained in the report and then sit down and look at what adjustments might be made to correct the problem
7694400 we recognize the pain suffered by mr healys family over his tragic passing
7694401 we hope the settlement brings them some measure of closure
7694402 let us pray for her and the baby boy she dreamed of with her in eternity in her good care
7694403 when her fellow traffic agents came back from a stressful day on the job they could always count on donnette to lighten their mood with a joke or a funny comment
7694404 she grew up on an island known for its beauty and serenity and she carried that with her even as she walked the streets of new york city
7694405 we have a feeling that they have split up and went different ways from finding some of the jumpsuits throughout the city
7694406 are looking at every family and background friend of the suspects and they will continue to do that until they hopefully capture these individuals
7694407 to get tunnel vision on where one suspect might be going we could actually miss the lead on another one
7694408 i cant comment on went wrong at this time if anything went wrong at all
7694409 the escapees are more of a threat right now than how they did it or how they got up to the roof
7694410 we received credible information that drug cartels in mexico have given permission to hit targets on the u s side of the border
7694411 cbp is on heightened alert ever since we became aware of the threats in mexico
7694412 building the b reactor was a feat of engineering genius so too was the construction a testament to the excellence of working americans
7694413 theres an enormous amount of things that can be learned here whether its about enrico fermi the history of nuclear energy or how a nuclear plant works
7694414 we want people to be able to stop in and spend some time here
7694415 it would be good for the guys to get a bit of cricket prior to the bangladesh tour and theyre all fit and ready to go
7694416 well monitor the environment and see if any of the other countries are willing to participate
7694417 were keen but i guess well just wait and see
7694418 it would be good for the guys to get a bit of cricket prior to the bangladesh tour and theyre all fit and ready to go
7694419 it took the icc a while to reach the right conclusion but they eventually did
7694420 were going to see if we can get him turned loose on a farm somewhere
7694421 were going to take him a long way from this building
7694422 a deeper understanding of neuroscience and its sic implications on sic leadership
7694423 our conditions were uncomfortable but because were westerners we suffered absolutely nothing compared to what the tibetan people suffer
7694424 the protesters participated in tibet independence activities and that is against chinas law
7694425 the relevant countries will teach their citizens to abide and respect chinas laws
7694426 they asked about our actions our roles about our lives everything from where i went to high school to everything i ate in china
7694427 it was the scariest it was beyond anything i could imagine in a movie
7694428 if hes killed on oct 14 we will kill a changed man
7694429 obviously felt that the mitigation we presented did not outweigh the aggravating factors in the case
7694430 this just does not sound like someone taking responsibility for the major part he played in killing these young women
7694431 in the 22 years since the defendant committed these brutal acts he has never demonstrated one second of genuine remorse for murdering these two young women
7694432 resisti tu fammi sentire che esisti ne abbiamo avuti di momenti tristi non lasciamoci andare cos un miracolo no ma tentare si puo

7694436 flight centre starts the new financial year with significant momentum from 2007 08 a strong balance sheet and with foundations in place for further growth acting chief executive shannon obrien said
7694437 while we do not expect to replicate the 30 per cent to 40 per cent increases we have achieved in each of the past two years we will be disappointed if we do not increase pre tax profit by 10 to 15 per cent
7694438 flight centre continues to increase its scale in all countries while also developing a broader foundation mr obrien said
7694439 in addition to being one of the worlds leading leisure travel providers the company is now a significant and emerging presence in global corporate and wholesale travel
7694440 we see our diversity of both brands and geography as a platform for the future and a real strength
7694441 there were studies into whether cats and guinea pigs can be infected this was done when the original outbreak occurred in 1994
7694442 we did a survey of bat carers and tested them and none showed any exposure to the hendra virus
7694443 bats wont be culled they are a protected species and are an important part of the ecosystem
7694444 we are far better looking at how horses catch the virus
7694445 we are studying how the virus travels in bat populations and how it is related to the reproductive cycle
7694446 we have continued to refine our brand proposition with significant investment in price merchandise range and quality during the year
7694447 we continue to make gains in market share with sold increases in key measures such as customer traffic basket size and items sold
7694448 in real growth terms this is an improvement on last year
7694449 go ahead swim in it til your fingers get all pruney
7694450 be prepared to all huddle in the bathrooms or the lp office because im not taking any chances
7694451 whilst we are pleased with the momentum in the business we are mindful that discretionary spending continues to be influenced by macro economic factors such as inflation fluctuating petrol prices interest rates and lower consumer confidence levels it said
7694452 this investment continues to deliver gains in market share he said
7694453 australian food and liquor continues to perform well and big w petrol and consumer electronics have had a good start to the new financial year
7694454 new zealand supermarkets has experienced tight trading conditions as in the fourth quarter it said
7694455 our current focus is to maintain a capital structure that will preserve our capital strength and give us the flexibility to pursue further growth opportunities
7694456 our balance sheet debt profile and strength of our credit ratings ensure we are very well placed for future growth both organically and through acquisition
7694457 any international expansion would have full oversight from the board be undertaken in a prudent and disciplined fashion and meet the hurdles required for all our capital investment decisions it said
7694458 it would mean for example in this current financial year a surplus of 20 billion instead of 21 5 billion
7694459 lets not be lectured by the labor party about fiscal rectitude they have nothing to tell us
7694460 they certainly dont have a mandate for these completely unjustifiable tax increases
7694461 what the government is actually doing is taxing australians now in an unjustifiable way in order to spend it later in order to buy their way back into office in 2010
7694462 but we are not going to vote for tax increases that we dont think the government has made the case for that are unjustifiable and simply increase prices for ordinary australians
7694463 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7694464 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7694465 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7694466 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7694467 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower

7694491 come on jack look at it this way you can finally kick my ass without guilt
7694492 why did my counterpart agree to let harlan begin again on a new robot after the first one malfunctioned so severely
7694493 i can only guess that the first tealc felt it appropriate that the team be complete
7694494 its just interesting to me that we cant eat or shit or pee or sweat but we can cry and spit and have something that resembles an orgasm but without ejaculate
7694495 i guess our eyeballs and the insides of our mouths need some kind of lubrication or oil if you will ill have to ask sam if shes analyzed that liquid is the spit the same as the tears or is it chemically different
7694496 you should definitely leave that to carter why ask me about it anyway
7694497 because its not sam im using for a teddy bear

7694504 im pretty sure i know how harlans former companions designed their portable batteries
7694505 didnt they just use them to walk off and you know die
7694506 yes they had no interest in a cell that would last longer than a few hours and they had no interest in recharging them or making them light enough to use for any extended period of time but i think ive solved all those issues
7694507 well i guess were going on a field trip then arent we
7694508 over me kneel over me so i can get you in my mouth from here
7694509 weve got 48 hours at the outside at that point were really cutting it close
7694510 theres no way to do mission proposals here and theres no dialing protocol for what planet to try next

7694512 id like to be out here for a sunset or a sunrise

7694518 all of us listen to our own genres of hip hop so we never stick to the same sound listening to our album is like listening to a compilation

7694538 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
7694539 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
7694540 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated
7694541 one desire has been the ruling passion of my life one high motive has acted like a spur upon my mind and soul and sooner should i seek escape from the sacred necessity that is laid upon me let the breath of life fail me it is this that in spite of all worldly opposition gods holy ordinances shall be established again in the home in the school and in the state for the good of the people to carve as it were into the conscience of the nation the ordinances of the lord to which the bible and creation bear witness until the nation pays homage again to god
7694542 effective managers and professionals in all walks of life have to become skilled in the art of reading the situations they are attempting to organise or manage
7694543 application of name or descriptive term to an object to which it is not literally applicable
7694544 all theories of organisation and management are based on implicit images or metaphors that lead us to see understand and manage organisations in distinctive yet partial ways
7694545 when we say the man is a lion we use the image of a lion to draw attention to the lion like aspects of the man
7694546 engage in a mode of thinking that generates important insights while having major limitations
7694547 as we enter the twenty first century we find bureaucracies and other modes of mechanistic organisation coming under increasing attack because of their rigidities and other dysfunctional consequences
7694548 under the influence of the machine metaphor organisation theory was locked into a form of engineering preoccupied with relations between goals structures and efficiency the idea that organisations are more like organisms has changed all this guiding our attention toward the more general issues of survival organisational environment relations and organisational effectiveness goals structures and efficiency now become subsidiary to problems of survival and other more biological concerns
7694549 when we choose a technical system whether in the form of an organisational structure job design or particular technology it always has human consequences and vice versa
7694550 this has been particularly well illustrated in many tavistock studies such as that conducted by eric trist and ken bamforth on technological change in coal mining in england in the late 1940s the attempt to mechanise the mining process through the introduction of assembly line coal cutting to the coal face created severe problems by destroying the informal fabric of social relations present in the mine the new technology promised increases in efficiency yet brought all the social problems now associated with the modern factory compounded many times by much worse physical conditions the resolution of the problems rested in finding a means of reconciling human needs and technical efficiency
7694551 there is no central controller which directs the body where to put each foot or how high to lift a leg should there be an obstacle ahead instead each leg is granted a few simple behaviours and each independently knows what to do under various circumstances for instance two basic behaviours can be thought of as if im a leg and im up put myself down or if im a leg and im forward put the other five legs back a little these processes exist independently run at all times and fire whenever the sensory preconditions are true to create walking then there just needs to be a sequencing of lifting legs this is the only instance where any central control is evident as soon as a leg is raised it automatically swings itself forward and also down but the act of swinging forward triggers all the other legs to move back a little since those legs happen to be touching the ground the body moves forward
7694552 could it be that sophisticated forms of intelligence emerge from the bottom up as the result of the integration of more modest capacities and intelligences
7694553 for the new certainty is change and organisations and their employees must now be prepared to change and be able to change in order to change appropriately they must be able to analyse themselves their processes structures and their environments be able to identify preferred and appropriate responses and be able to implement them in a word organisations must be able to learn and to learn from their learning on the basis of this learning choices will be made choices of structure of process of organisation of product of market relationship with staff with subcontractors and with clients and these choices themselves must be the subject of constant review and revision a barrier to learning is thus a barrier to survival
7694554 most of us if asked to think about how we have learned think of our experiences when attempts have been made to
7694555 in the managerial world dealing with live problems rather than being taught is the major source of significant learning
7694556 the managers job is to learn on behalf of the organisation operating systems are increasingly self regulating and the managers contribution is focused on how these can be improved or working out what the next generation of systems should be and working towards those
7694557 an organisation which encourages and develops these qualities in its people can be called a learning company literally a group of people who learn in company not only as individuals but also as a whole organism for the learning company requires its people to manage themselves and to learn for themselves their colleagues and for the company as a whole
7694558 who have shaped and are shaping the field of organisational learning theory
7694559 all meaningful knowledge is for the sake of action and all some good in the world m eaningful action for the sake of friendship
7694560 one stop shopping for busy managers seeking quick solutions to entrenched and systemic problems
7694561 i love to learn but i hate to be taught
7694562 writers on learning organisations tend to be strong on ideas but noticeably weak when it comes to practical tools which organisations can actually use to promote learning
7694563 at best grudging in response to new initiatives and at worst is downright confrontational and pig headed
7694564 impacting upon the norms and values of our organisational environment
7694565 we have been going for 10 years and have not produced anything of real consequence we have entertained lots of projects rather than pick an area and try to figure out how to get there
7694566 you need lots of balls in the air because the odds on any one are so low
7694567 nbd tends to take the path of least resistance placing new technology
7694568 were not organised to do the job not only in development but in the whole
7694569 a designer makes things sometimes he makes the final product more often he makes a representation a plan programme or image of an artifact to be constructed by others he works in particular situations uses particular materials and employs a distinctive medium and language typically his making process is complex there are more variables kinds of possible moves norms and interrelationships of these than can be represented in a finite model because of this complexity the designers moves tend happily or unhappily to produce consequences other than those intended when this happens the designer may take account of the unintended changes he has made in the situation by forming new appreciations and understandings and by making new moves he shapes the situation in accordance with his initial appreciation of it the situation talks back and he responds to the situations back talk
7694570 in answer to the situations back talk the designer reflects in action on the construction of the problem the strategies of action or the model of the phenomena
7694571 if people are aware of what they are presently doing and can be encouraged to reflect on it and to consider alternatives they are in an excellent position to change and to try out new ways of behaving
7694572 the ability to conduct most of a learning conversation with oneself is the essence of self organisation
7694573 the designers moves tend happily or unhappily to produce consequences other than those intended when this happens the designer may take account of the unintended changes he has made in the situation by forming new appreciations and understandings and by making new moves he shapes the situation in accordance with his initial appreciation of it the situation talks back and he responds to the situations back talk
7694574 there are too many cases in which organisations know less than their members there are even cases in which the organisations cannot seem to learn what every member knows
7694575 i have been particularly intrigued by the possibility of using metaphors for shaping the structure of learning events the aim is to get beyond telling people what you think they may need to know by creating an experience that allows them to live the reality of what needs to be done
7694576 whether one is a manager wishing to make a key communication to ones colleagues or staff or an hrd practitioner seeking to develop creative impactful learning processes the message is to use resonant metaphors for shaping key learning experiences where actions speak louder than words
7694577 brilliant ideas and great insights often go nowhere most of us have had the experience of making a breakthrough in our understanding of a situation only to find that it eventually withers away as we encounter the idea months or years later we are left wondering whatever happened there a great idea why didnt it take off perhaps the idea initiative contradicted existing culture which mobilised political opposition perhaps it got lost in the heat of fighting other battles perhaps it just atrophied through dwindling commitment or insufficient understanding
7694578 the ceo of a manufacturing organisation wishes to open and acclimatise staff to the challenges of the firms changing environment
7694579 a group of middle managers in a telecommunications company have come together to develop an action plan to implement a new phase of their organisational development strategy
7694580 in itself delegation has great value morale and performance are improved top management is freed for strategic planning and decisions are made by those on the ground and therefore more in the know most importantly the organisation benefits from the imagination and thinking of its high flyers
7694581 the starting point for any innovation is an idea it may be a brilliant new invention or a recognition that something tried and trusted in one context can be usefully transposed into a new and different setting it may be the result of one individual working alone or of several people working together
7694582 creativity enhancement is no miracle cure for organisational ills but used intelligently it can be a way of loading the dice in an organisations favour
7694583 until there have been more long term evaluation studies which focus on the transfer of creativity skills to real work performance the effectiveness of creativity training in organisations remains uncertain
7694584 there are times when past creative behaviour does not predict potential well most of us can think of examples of organisational members who were promoted on the basis of an apparently creative track record but having reached their desired position of seniority very soon became anything but creative
7694585 if creative ideas repeatedly achieve nothing because of poor communication the motivation of organisational members to continue to be creative is likely to be reduced
7694586 the greater risk is in not responding creatively to the threats and opportunities of a rapidly changing environment creativity enhancement is no miracle cure for organisational ills but used intelligently it can be a way of loading the dice in an organisations favour
7694587 i have no wish to oversimplify the complex mosaic of forces at play in work settings that impact creative behaviours processes and outcomes we cannot directly manage creativity because we really do not directly manage either creative persons or processes indeed to attempt to do so is likely to be counterproductive what we can manage is aspects of the situation that impact creative behaviour and outcomes the high payoff strategy is to understand and identify contextual aspects that evoke and nurture creative acts
7694588 corporations tend to be authoritarian institutions run by a few people with enormous power who are survivors and products of the system
7694589 there are a number of widely embraced business practices that underscore the fundamentally anti creative nature of most organisations for example the popular benchmarking asks people to copy what others are doing not to come up with their own unique ways of doing things
7694590 many corporations have special programmes to promote creativity this is of course an admission that creativity does not or cannot exist under normal conditions for programmes to work they must become part of the way of life or culture
7694591 se de alguma forma voc s nos criaram ent o quem criou voc s
7694592 well sir i hate god im a drunk sinner who tells everyone im a christian so that it will make people feel better about giving me money to buy crack

7694603 erm well its not that i dont like them im just not a dog lover
7694604 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7694605 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7694606 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7694607 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7694608 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7694609 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
7694610 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
7694611 we have had a spate of window etching in the lincoln rd and moorhouse ave areas in the last couple of weeks particularly between august 1 and 4
7694612 i would estimate that the damage in the moorhouse ave lincoln road area in the past few weeks would be in excess of 50 000
7694613 this type of crime is also happening in most other parts of the city and needs to be stopped
7694614 kini kami akan segera memulai pertandingan babak kualifikasi piala dunia saya mendoakan agar marcello dapat mengulang kejayaannya di jerman saya akan mendukung dia dan pemain lainnya

7694616 the problem is playing toronto cincinnati and beijing then coming back here in two weeks two times 12 hours jet lag
7694617 im a little bit more tired than i usually am but at the same time i must be very happy how i did this year
7694618 i was holding the medal for three days to make sure its not a dream its real
7694619 its really very hard not to think about the olympic games yesterday i was trying to go to sleep but i couldnt because my mind is still there
7694620 the whole steve being out the first couple of games and with our numbers being depleted its a good thing that our running backs are running as well as they are right now
7694621 im disappointed for our football team but im also disappointed for him
7694622 hes a guy who was on our practice squad most of last year he made it onto the active roster and worked his tail off all offseason and was really having a good camp and had a real strong possibility of making our football team
7694623 therell be a lot of guys that we can look at and well just see what our potential is on our football team and obviously the other people out there
7694624 weve been really pushing him hard to work just to work hard
7694625 that way you dont have to turn it on or try to turn it on in a game thats what you do all the time and hes done that hes really working hard its kind of showing up in the games
7694626 to have that kind of exposure people talking about ucla football in anticipation of this game is terrific
7694627 we want to be a national recruiter we want to have people across the united states to look at this game and say that would be a cool place to play
7694628 in terms of getting our program where we want it this is important to play on this kind of stage you dont have to look very far for an example of somebody who did just that right across town usc coach pete carroll he went out and played all these kind of games and fared favorably and obviously built a program that certainly is among the best if not the best right now
7694629 to go and lay an egg would probably have an initial negative repercussion but you can always point to the fact they tv wanted to see ucla they want ucla because of the los angeles market and so forth and were not going to lay an egg the next time
7694630 i dont like to talk in those terms because i prefer to look at it as if its going to go well
7694631 im really really happy with staff ive put together and the way they work with one another the way we get things accomplished and get to the heart of the matter rather than dancing around issues because of egos and stuff
7694632 i do think kevin and chris forcier are on the verge of blossoming into very good players hopefully it could be as soon as monday night
7694633 but even if we take our lumps early in the season i do believe they have the makeup to be good players
7694634 you deal with them you stay focused on the biggest product which is what youre trying to get done and then you move forward
7694635 to be honest i believe it might be a distraction
7694636 i believe a couple of guys may take it as a distraction may take it as man they should have told us a little earlier but the more mature guys are like ok whatever well move on
7694637 i dont think it is because we havent really been talking about it
7694638 we havent really been thinking about it its things that happened those guys are handling it well and i think well be all right

7694640 they tried to humiliate me and i was not going to be humiliated over this
7694641 if i was carrying nail clippers and forgot about them i wouldnt have gotten so upset but here i was just wearing my underwear
7694642 its actually a little funny in a way but a sad sad commentary on the state of our country
7694643 this is bigger than just me there are 150 million women in america and this could happen to any of them
7694644 we do everything we can to ensure that a passenger doesnt feel humiliated
7694645 they cant find bombs in checked luggage and theyre essentially doing a pat down of private parts this is a security apparatus that is out of control

7694652 obama and his family were featured on the cover of people magazine this month and he has also been a cover boy for and rolling stone among others
7694653 survey data is beginning to identify what some people are calling obama fatigue he may have predicated too much of his campaign on biography
7694654 that only takes you so far in a general election the coverage may be too much about obama and not enough for obamas cause about his ideas
7694655 i do not pray for these only but also for those who believe in me through their word that they may all be one even as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also might be in us so that the world may believe that thou has sent me
7694656 and he said to him you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
7694657 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7694658 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7694659 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
7694660 i think this is a great place to get a little attention on what no child left behind is doing to our kids and to our teachers
7694661 i just slapped it together with some glue and put it on
7694662 all of you are aware of the serious nature of this years fire season and the issues faced by the agency in paying for fire suppression costs
7694663 at this time the only option for financing the shortfall is to use the agencys transfer authority
7694664 the unfortunate thing is that it is across the board
7694665 i recognize that this direction will have a significant effect on agency operations
7694666 however we must be in a position to protect life and property from wildfire and do so within the funds available to the agency
7694667 the fire season in montana and across the country is far from over not to mention we have good paying jobs to fund and projects around the state that need to be completed
7694668 funding should not be pulled from our states resources to help pay for fighting fires in california
7694669 the costs are high and they need to suppress these fires to protect people
7694670 but the forest service is basically becoming the fire service
7694671 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7694672 if actually deployed will leave our country more vulnerable than the existing yet flawed system in operation today
7694673 the risk is of creating a neo colonial pact for the provision of non value added raw materials in the producing countries and unacceptable work conditions for agricultural workers
7694674 has been put in place only for african countries only for poor countries
7694675 rwanda cannot be part of that colonialism slavery and imperialism

7694678 what has been called the long war is likely to be many years of persistent engaged combat all around the world in differing degrees of size and intensity this generational campaign cannot be wished away or put on a timetable there are no exit strategies to paraphrase the bolshevik leon trotsky we may not be interested in the long war but the long war is interested in us
7694679 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u

7694681 you made it we were getting worried then we saw you walking across the parking lot
7694682 theyre trying to renovate downtown and part of the renovation has to be that people feel safe about coming and opening businesses in downtown nobody wants to open a new business with hookers and drug dealers right out in their entrance
7694683 when the taliban fell and i decided to come back to afghanistan some of my family was not happy with me
7694684 my three sons even did not come back with me but my wife and daughter did and we now live and work in kabul
7694685 when we heard from the ministry of education in kabul that they desperately needed land for a school my wife encouraged me to give this land here for a girls school
7694686 she had to move away from panjshir to get an education and she didnt want the girls today to have to do the same thing
7694687 it is a good thing that his family was willing to give their personal land for a girls school because good useable land is getting very hard to find here in panjshir
7694688 when i decided to come back to afghanistan a good friend of mine from holland asked me why i would want to leave the netherlands for afghanistan
7694689 i told him that i was sure that as long as coalition forces were here helping our government then i knew it would be a good safe place to come
7694690 i am very happy that i made the decision to come back to afghanistan because i can do something for the people here for my people

7694700 last night i was digging through a box of random audio equipment and noticed some remotes which turned out to contain some fascinating and rare batteries inspired i took pictures of them theyre very large 3264x2448 so i am going to send you links to them rather than attachments and you can retrieve them yourself
7694701 first up a startlingly cheap bicycle headlight turned out to contain a pair of excell aas theyre nice and shiny since this light has never been used on an actual bike
7694702 second a trio of extra energy aas looking very blue they came installed in a light up umbrella no really
7694703 third our old friend golden power showing up packed in with a korg kaossilator
7694704 the kaossilator is a depressingly trendy audio toy the first picture is just the batteries and the second includes the korg itself they were described on the box as test batteries im not sure what that implies
7694705 fourth the gold peak greencell which is indeed green i forget what they were in it was probably something embarrassing so you can make something up if youd like
7694706 fifth the astonishing new titen these came with a mostly low quality device designed to allow you to hook your crappy old game console up to your shiny new computer monitor and thus save you the trouble of having to own both a monitor and a television
7694707 it also saves you the trouble of playing games since it doesnt really work very well the new titens appear to have started to corrode and were quickly thrown out after this photo shoot
7694708 sixth the vinnic line returns these were installed in a remote control for a tiny and very trendy audiophile grade pre amp note that while the remote has loads of buttons the pre amp itself has only a knob
7694709 the volume buttons control the knob its motorised and only the first two buttons on the keypad are functional they switch between the two inputs on the pre amp actually the third button controls a tape output but really who uses that kind of thing any more i havent touched an actual cassette in years in short if you lose the remote youre basically screwed
7694710 vinnic batteries if you recall were previously involved in an embarrassing display of your willingness to encourage some fellow to dig through his girlfriends things dismantling her personal items
7694711 note that the old vinnics i have submitted are the original design and are considered highly collectible in some segments of the battery market
7694712 i hope you find these submissions fascinating and delightful please attempt to ignore my filthy floor at least the filth is depicted in detailed high resolution

7694770 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks

7694810 faith in the having mode is the possession of an answer for which one has no rational proof it consists of formulations created by others which one accepts because one submits to those others usually a bureaucracy it carries the feeling of certainty because of the real or only imagined power of the bureaucracy it is the entry ticket to join a large group of people it relieves one of the hard task of thinking for oneself and making decisions one becomes one of the beati possidentes the happy owners of the right faith faith in the having mode gives certainty it claims to pronounce ultimate unshakable knowledge which is believable because the power of those who promulgate and protect the faith seems unshakable indeed who would not choose certainty if all it requires is to surrender ones independence god becomes in the having mode an idol in the prophetic concept an idol is a thing that we ourselves make and project our own powers into thus impoverishing ourselves we then submit to our creation and by our submission are in touch with ourselves in an alienated form while i can have the idol because it is a thing by my submission to it it simultaneously has me once he has become an idol gods alleged qualities have as little to do with my personal experience as alienated political doctrines do the idol may be praised as lord of mercy yet any cruelty may be committed in its name just as the alienated faith in human solidarity may not even raise doubts about committing the most inhuman acts faith in the having mode is a crutch for those who want to be certain those who want an answer to life without daring to search for it themselves in the being mode faith is an entirely different phenomenon can we live without faith must not the nursling have faith in its mothers breast must we all not have faith in other beings in those whom we love and in ourselves can we live without faith in the validity of norms for our life indeed without faith we become sterile hopeless afraid to the very core of our being faith in the being mode is not in the first place a belief in certain ideas although it may be that too but an inner orientation an attitude it would be better to say that one is in faith than that one has faith one can be in faith toward oneself and toward others and the religious person can be in faith toward god
7694811 this best fits all that i am but let it not constrict me beyond what is meant to be constricted at this time in my life

7694813 he refuses to do a book so this is more like a talking book a really thorough autobiography
7694814 im trying to paint a realistic picture of who my father is i think the osbournes to a degree tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy yeah my dad can be that guy but its not him
7694815 i think that the osbournes almost discredited who he is as an artist my dads not an idiot hes nothing short of a genius in my opinion he does have huge flaws and were trying to really paint an honest picture of that
7694816 it doesnt make you feel like we were 1 11 last year for sure

7694823 we felt like the changes needed to be made you know high energy from younger coaches and all that is good stuff but when youve got old guys who have been there done it who still have high energy thats even better
7694824 thats what we landed on with coach bleil a high energy guy who has been there has seen it and knows how to make adjustments weve kind of got the best of both worlds
7694825 last year everyone was questioning everything in the locker room no one was confident at all in what we were doing
7694826 everyones on the same page this year everyones more confident about what were doing and we all move faster its going to be fun its going to be a lot different than last year and everyones really excited about it
7694827 we just have to improve how we play later in the season
7694828 thats not to say that we will just coast and then turn it on i think we just need to make plays
7694829 i want to get this place going where it should be
7694830 im real satisfied when we get a chance to play a school like texas and next year we have kansas coming in here

7694842 what martin did diminishes the dignity of a human being you cant just buy or rent life its even worse when someone famous and in the public eye is doing it
7694843 i dont think its right to deny children of maternal figures just because you have a big ego
7694844 the flight attendant came back and told us to remain calm thats when we saw the two pilots with the oxygen masks on hearing them breathe like darth vader made it a little harder to stay calm
7694845 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks i cant imagine what might have happened if that window had shattered at 30 000 feet
7694846 i think this is a great place to get a little attention on what no child left behind is doing to our kids and to our teachers

7694856 its part of my past that i want to still have it be part of my future too
7694857 i didnt have the pressure of playing at wimbledon as an english player i could come here and get on with it
7694858 the first year i got a wild card into the main draw and i had played juniors before thinking that i was out of league and that i was just so fortunate to be able to walk on the grounds
7694859 becoming a champion of it and then becoming a player with really good results and now coming back as a mom and as a former no 1 and the champion i mean its just all overwhelming
7694860 i thought i played pretty well considering i havent really played since april and had been injured
7694861 i knew i drew a tough opponent in the first round so im happy to have played the way i did and get through in the scoreline in the fashion i did
7694862 all of a sudden just right before the olympics it seemed to turn a corner
7694863 i have no idea what happened but it feels better now
7694864 now that ive started to work really hard off the court you go into the matches with sort of no excuses no worries
7694865 its a complete waste of time going on the court and finding reasons why you might lose the match and what have you you just go out there and fight for every single point because thats a complete waste of time putting the work in if youre not going to use it out on the court
7694866 we have some young guys and i mentioned to them that everybody starts off as a no name and some of these guys are building names for themselves now
7694867 if we go out and play like this every week its going to be hard to beat us
7694868 especially up front because how we go up front is how we go as a defense so we just really need to be able to do this week in and week out
7694869 it makes a world of difference when were able to sit back and we can cover and theyre getting pressure getting it out of the quarterbacks hands fast and we are early on our coverage
7694870 youve got to get back and try to block him because hes so fast it makes it hard on a guy if he gets them going upfield and turns it into power hes going to knock him back because hes got leverage on them hes doing some awesome stuff and just seeing him come in and act like hes pass rushing when a quarterback starts scrambling the way he covers ground on the other side of the fields just unbelievable

7694880 a psychopathic mass murdering schizophrenic clown with zero empathy and an unnatural love of hamburgers
7694881 i cant stop thinking at night my body is exhausted and my mind is still going
7694882 im wondering what drives a man to eat that many hamburgers and wear a gray crown beanie and let his bushy sheepdog hot dog slobber on him uncontrollably
7694883 frankly i dont think i could handle the role if it wasnt for all the ecstasy
7694884 its clear from the dark knight that audiences want dark versions of beloved characters so thats what were going to give them almost exclusively
7694885 im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
7694886 people know that i can give the kind of speech that i gave four years ago thats not the question on voters mind i think theyre much more interested in what am i going to do to help them in their lives
7694887 and so in that sense this is going to be a more workman like speech
7694888 theres not a liberal america and a conservative america theres the united states of america
7694889 theres not a black america and white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
7694890 you know 2004 i think was unique nobody knew who i was and i think even up to the time that i walked on to the stage and we had handed out obama signs people were thinking what is this

7694912 despite the challenges usip managed to build productive relationships with both the grp and milf helped the parties come up with creative solutions to stubborn issues of ancestral domain and started dialogue between disparate moro ethnic groups
7694913 through its activities usip introduced concepts and approaches that were useful to both government and milf peace panels

7694915 i think 80 of them have already said they are going to work hard for obama
7694916 we have to convince those hard core hard hard core hillary supporters to move towards obama
7694917 hillary had an inside track already and obama had to build his bridges from day one
7694918 when you talk about hillary being new york based thats the strongest sector of the indian community its a natural mesh whether its the jewish community or the indian community thats the strongest point starting from there
7694919 it didnt necessarily translate to the rest of the country hillary also brought deserving or not a lot of negatives with her
7694920 ever since obama became the leader i feel the holdback has been much less in the indian community than in the rest of the country
7694921 there is no embarrassment and no shame to say that in both communities we recognize the fact that we have two mothers

7694946 investors were cautious about painting alstom with the same brush as siemens which has been embroiled in a slush fund scandal also the previous investigation into alstom was over infrastructure contracts in south america and asia between 1995 and 2003 before the companys chief executive patrick kron took charge if the previous investigation was over past contracts chances are that this one is too suggesting a limited impact on the company and its current management

7694960 to be truly effective a global response is needed but the uk has an opportunity to lead the way
7694961 in the uk alone biofuel subsidies cost 550m annually in 2005 a similar investment in preventing deforestation and peatland destruction could have offset the equivalent of up to 37 of all uk co2 emissions
7694962 in the uk we can dramatically increase funding for forest and peatland projects domestically and with key partners especially in south east asia as well as lobbying at an international level for the right global policies
7694963 all this can be done within our current budget by ending wasteful and damaging biofuel subsidies
7694964 while ministers are calling for the international community to look at the impact of biofuels here in the uk the governments policy means people are filling up their cars with biofuels that may be damaging the environment and endangering food security
7694965 time and again the government has been warned that their policy of targets without safeguards is madness

7694973 hey i missed the demo from so n so what did they show
7694974 if you thought you couldnt afford a hasselblad think again
7694975 folks my watch says 8 30 and thats the time we are supposed to start the demo my mother taught me to always try to be on time or call if i was going to be late so i will leave it up to you should we start now or give those people who are not here yet a few more minutes
7694976 what do you hope to get out of this demo today
7694977 im curious would you tell me why you are here today
7694978 people forget that a demo is not a show n tell its a show n sell youre not there to demonstarte feature after feature after feature while putting people to sleep your job during the demo is to sell the product your company and yourself
7694979 you know about the golden rule do unto others as you want them to do unto you i believe you should always break that rule when giving a demo if you want to be ultra successful in your demos you should demo unto others as they want not as you want this approach will increase sales
7694980 look i am going to tell you and describe to you what you would see if this was working

7694991 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7694992 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7694993 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7694994 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers

7695030 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
7695031 theyre going all of these routes through threats intimation to try to thwart the here because they dont have an argument on merit
7695032 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
7695033 your station is committed to operating in the public interest an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity
7695034 with all our problems why is talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7695035 i think this is a great place to get a little attention on what no child left behind is doing to our kids and to our teachers

7695043 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7695044 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7695045 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though
7695046 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7695047 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7695048 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7695049 and i know he has been supportive of secretary rices state department
7695050 i think secretary rice has made clear who she intends to vote for and that will be and whomever he chooses to join him on the ticket
7695051 im sure theres also a baseball game on tonight too

7695055 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7695056 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
7695057 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7695058 ive talked to the mccain campaign a little bit about the issue but certainly not about me being in that mix

7695066 once the missile defense system is put in place it will work automatically with the entire nuclear capability of the united states it will be an integral part of the us nuclear capability and for the first time in history and i want to emphasize this there will be elements of the us nuclear capability on the european continent it simply changes the whole configuration of international security of course we have to respond to that
7695067 us missiles in europe beyond deterrence to first strike threat
7695068 by means of a us first strike about 99 of russian nuclear forces would be taken out
7695069 some people have the illusion that you can do everything just as you want regardless of the interests of other people of course it is for precisely this reason that the international situation gets worse and eventually results in an arms race but we are not the instigators we do not want it why would we want to divert resources to this and we are not jeopardizing our relations with anyone but we must respond name even one step that we have taken or one action of ours designed to worsen the situation there are none we are not interested in that we are interested in maintaining a good atmosphere
7695070 it would be better to look for other ways to fight terrorism than create low yield nuclear weapons that lower the threshold for using these weapons and thereby put humankind on the brink of nuclear catastrophe
7695071 i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
7695072 when a new planned building rises in the slum be it a public toilet or a sewing co operative it immediately becomes a monument
7695073 architects were typically doing these darth vader things with helicopters and gee whiz materials they came at it with a lot of enthusiasm or commercial interest there was a lot of experimentation going on the fact that shelter had to come out of local material and processes eluded these people when you told them that you can build a permanent house in bangladesh in three days for the same amount of money they were proposing to spend on temporary housing they ignored you

7695082 keep in mind that this coverage may not be permanent
7695083 we believe this action will present a capital structure that both provides for future funding and increases overall shareholder value
7695084 the combination of rapidly increasing volume and the changing dynamics of network traffic require a high speed density ethernet switching capability that does not exist today there are reportedly 8 hours of video being created by applications like youtube every minute of the day and industry forecasts predict video to increase from 30 to 80 of the traffic on the network in the next four years as recently remarked by john donovan from at amp t nyse t it took 100 years to get 1 billion devices on the network it will take less than 10 years to get the next billion the sheer magnitude of this change will require both innovation and new approaches to the network as we know it
7695085 in order to leapfrog todays switching solutions we designed both the hardware and software to be cost effective and carrier hardened from the inception of the project
7695086 we have 288 10ge ports per switch with headroom to go to twice that amount all at line speed with no blocking in the networks and under the control of a sophisticated quality of service sensitive software system all of this genuinely differentiates our switching product in the market as well as being ten times faster at a third of the price of the current competition
7695087 there was a concern about the increased cost to carriers we accommodated that by reducing the speed zones
7695088 its disappointing that it cant be all that it could be
7695089 if we didnt lose one or two females a year
7695090 we want the speed to be slow enough so that the whales have a chance to get out of the way or the blow will be a glancing blow and they will survive
7695091 people there want to see you touch you hear you
7695092 some of it is going to depend on who mccain picks its going to depend on what kind of rural program that obamas going to have and what kind of rural program that mccains going to have
7695093 when all is said and done i dont think hes going to spend too much time in rural areas
7695094 in the south its a double hurdle because culturally john mccain would appear closer to rural voters and of course theres the racial issue in the south its tough sledding for him
7695095 he needs to get populist and start talking about screwing those who screwed us out here
7695096 he needs to start talking about enforcing antitrust laws and leveling the playing field on trade treaties i think if he does that hell be ok
7695097 i think he can make real inroads in rural america
7695098 99 percent sure a president obama isnt going to infringe on gun rights
7695099 i agree with her but thats the message hes not been able to send yet in rural areas outside of the northwest
7695100 theyre not looking for a tribe theyre looking for somebody to represent their issues very well and if theyll just look instead of listening to rush limbaugh theyll find out that in most cases the democrats are much more in tune
7695101 malia you know this stuff on rich and all goes back and forth because you can argue one guys a little uppity and ah its a zero sum game right where do we go with this
7695102 crazy bell ringer was right theres money to be made in a place like this

7695130 my fellow americans tonight america faces a new evil that is a threat to american life liberty and all that america stands for our intelligence services inform us that for the last 130 years several million canadians have been amassing along our northern border many of them armed with hockey sticks something has got to be done to stop these ungodly canadians and as far as this president is concerned a bunch of evil tree hugging beer swilling puck heads who always say please and thank you after every sentence arent even a real country besides america doesnt appreciate people who actually think that canada is bigger than texas thats why ive decided to bomb their capital toronto goodnight america and god bless

7695139 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about his judgment than any ad ever could and the fact that hes launching his own convention by defending his long association with a man who says he didnt bomb enough u s targets tells us more about barack obama than any of tonights speeches will

7695149 but each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey
7695150 and i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me my mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion and her intelligence reflected in my own daughters
7695151 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7695152 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7695153 we were in there from about six to eight oclock with all phases going through evaluating special teams rating all the special teams so it was probably a couple of hours
7695154 every day we tell our players you get an opportunity to get better or get worse
7695155 theyve had a good three weeks of practice certainly well have a lot to learn in understanding the speed of the game and how fast its going to go weve got good leadership up front on both sides of the ball and were going to have to rely on them to lead the way for us
7695156 when we signed them we told everybody from signing day on to prepare mentally and physically
7695157 to prepare like you are going to play next fall after 10 14 days of practice well decide if you are physically and mentally ready to play and if we have the need in that case well play you and if not well redshirt you

7695160 we received credible information that drug cartels in mexico have given permission to hit targets on the u s side of the border
7695161 one of the first things we did was to notify all officers in our department of the situation
7695162 we first learned of the threat last week our deputies are in a higher state of awareness we will respond to any incident appropriately
7695163 we are aware of it and we are addressing it
7695164 cbp is on heightened alert ever since we became aware of the threats in mexico
7695165 we are closely monitoring these developments and will act accordingly to protect the integrity of the border
7695166 we are always in the business of analyzing this type of information
7695167 its further evidence of the blatant just the audacity of these cartels
7695168 youve got three cartels in juarez with a fight between the gulf and the sinaloa cartels along with the juarez cartel so that might have contributed to pushing some people across the border

7695175 i like to think that im pretty knowledgeable on nasty and extremely horny conduct but i recognize that there are things out there that ive never heard of
7695176 when i learn something new i try to utilize it in my films so that people are always shocked and in awe its higher education that captures your attention my films like black cock slut are filth at its best and of course blu ray filth is even better
7695177 the important thing is he has the intellectual ability to learn

7695179 if biden gives that little extra boost to obama in places like the scranton wilkes barre area in a tight race like the 11th its a nice add on for kanjorski
7695180 while i recognize the benefits of properly developed casinos i have long been a proponent of re siting

7695189 we still prefer to use natural bait they seem to produce best for us catfish love baits like worms chicken livers and fresh cut bait ask others who fish in your area what baits are working for them it is important to select the right bait for the fish you are after channel catfish and blue catfish are scavengers and will hit just about any bait flatheads on the other hand are predators meaning they prefer to hit live baits many people think flatheads are scavengers but that assumption is wrong
7695190 mr williamsons public chastisement and tony ryalls criticisms of labours secret agenda to amalgamate district health boards show that national is clearly not going to change a single thing in health
7695191 amalgamating some dhbs would be a good thing abolishing them all would be even better the debate over how many dhbs new zealand should have is purely academic the system is only held together by the commitment and dedication of doctors nurses and other health professionals at the front line
7695192 dhbs are a phoney democracy people think they elect a board to make decisions for the benefit of local populations but boards only exist to implement the government of the days health policies
7695193 as such the 21 dhbs exist for one reason only to pretend kiwis make decisions locally when in fact health is centrally controlled by the government

7695196 its frustrating because i want to be here and help the team but for me not being 100 percent to go out there its not just hurting the team its me not being 100 percent
7695197 i was told nothing could make it worse which is why i wanted to pitch through it it just hasnt gone away
7695198 weve all seen john maine even without his best stuff if im not mistaken he had a pretty good game in pittsburgh
7695199 but the bottom line is we cannot risk his long term health in the midst of this pennant race which means that guys are going to have to step up
7695200 i think through the past weeks and months and years with the media talking about my putting and writing about my putting and people talking about my putting and people wanting to help me i must have had hundreds of letters and phone calls and all saying that they can fix my putting it kind of gets in your head that youre not a good putter
7695201 so i made a point after last week that im going to change that attitude and i believed in myself that im the best putter and i came out here with a different attitude
7695202 if i keep doing this im going to win a lot more
7695203 i tried to bunt just to tie the game on the visitors side thats kind of weird
7695204 ive never seen anything like that and hopefully we never see that again especially when you lose a game when you wait this long
7695205 there needs to be some proper time for reflection there shouldnt be a knee jerk reaction to the outstanding performance of this team we need to analyse the results look at what happened underneath the medal tables
7695206 it has been both an inspirational and outstanding performance and it was a huge privilege to lead such a close knit motivated and successful team i hope many of the athletes will be with us at the greatest moment in british sport when we host the olympics in 2012
7695207 we need support not just at an elite level but also facilities to encourage youngsters to take up sport not just for the olympics but for the general well being of the nation
7695208 just enjoying it and that passion that drives you forward
7695209 i would hope that this highlights road racing and that it inspires people
7695210 but if we really want people to understand the sport it is going to come from getting people riding to work and school and kids having cycling as part of their life
7695211 we were just sitting back chilling sipping the champers it was wicked
7695212 my daughter is the best thing thats ever happened to me that sounds so pat i know but thats how it is
7695213 i love it because i relate to the idea of being in like with someone not really loving someone but liking someone enough to prolong the relationship
7695214 hm so its very very unlikely that i will meet someone to fall in love with or marry if thats the way its going to be if im going to go to my grave as a single person i better start getting used to it i better start being happy being single
7695215 we really have no pre conceived notion of what were going to recommend
7695216 we want it finished when its finished its more important to get it done right
7695217 they hok sport think they can have it done this year
7695218 i would like to see you modernize the inside of your building any way you can
7695219 we have a feeling that they have split up and went different ways from finding some of the jumpsuits throughout the city
7695220 are looking at every family and background friend of the suspects and they will continue to do that until they hopefully capture these individuals
7695221 to get tunnel vision on where one suspect might be going we could actually miss the lead on another one
7695222 i cant comment on went wrong at this time if anything went wrong at all
7695223 the escapees are more of a threat right now than how they did it or how they got up to the roof
7695224 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7695225 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7695226 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7695227 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7695228 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7695229 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7695230 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7695231 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7695232 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7695233 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7695234 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7695235 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7695236 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7695237 talk about their life together and building a family grounded in faith and values
7695238 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a champions league qualifier i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team
7695239 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages
7695240 we didnt play well and we know well have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage its always a funny time for us to have such a massive game before weve got going in the season some of our results have reflected that
7695241 we lost at home to ak graz in the year we won the competition and had a narrow win in the last minute against maccabi haifa two years ago so anyone thinking well win comfortably knows thats very dangerous

7695245 sen biden improved the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when he believed amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments sen biden had to make the tough calls and he voted to pass a bill
7695246 i got to keep a lot of the clothes too
7695247 the vietnam war was raging and the body count was high
7695248 the idea of an assassination like the one depicted in the film did not appear to be so far fetched
7695249 we are in a position where we have to beat the red sox but we have to win win win no matter who we play
7695250 they blow us out we blow them out close games we win close games we lose
7695251 we have to take advantage of this series with the red sox
7695252 this is our chance to move up in the standings its big for us
7695253 but now that theyve won a couple of championships they are able to relax a bit

7695274 i have a great deal of respect for women whom i always treat as equals and never as sex objects

7695277 much higher price of p23 800 000 in purchasing a 70 000 square meter landfill site at p340 sq m when the city government could have opted for the p12 866 800 site measuring 160 835 sq m at p80 sq m on july 9 this year the city council of bacolod ratified the deed of conditional sale opening an avenue for the city to pay dynasty agricultural corporation p23 800 000 this was per resolution 525 on july 25 also of this year disbursement voucher civ 5449 in the amount of p20m was made in favor of dynasty as partial payment for the purchase of the 70 000 sq m landfill the remaining balance of p3 800 000 reads the complaint will be paid after a year as stipulated in the deed the complainant further recalled that on april 8 2008 the moya guanzon amp sons farms incorporated wrote gasataya on its willingness to sell a landfill of 160 835 sq m the moya guanzon amp sons farms incorporated outbid the dynasty almost seven times lower nonetheless leonardia et al concentrated their attention to buy the 70 000 sq m
7695278 to the damage and prejudice of the city government in the amount of p10 933 200 these public officials motivated by evident bad faith manifest impartiality and gross inexcusable negligence chose a much higher price giving dynasty undue advantage unwarranted benefit and preference
7695279 the kci stand is no to recall there is no solid ground for it this will be a futile exercise loss of time and money the so called loss of confidence that kambilan is invoking is due to the resignation of most of the internal followers of among ed and the demand of the members of the biyaya a luluguran at sisikapan balas for the removal of provincial administrator vivian dabu
7695280 i was told by my legal counsel that i should not be recalled instead it is those people who were involved in the issues of quarry irregularities and corruption in government

7695296 david and victoria beckham were driving a car that had been scratched the day before when it had been left parked at the airport they were not involved in any accident at all
7695297 heh looks like a decent game but i dont know if therell be another goal especially from roma
7695298 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7695299 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7695300 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7695301 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7695302 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7695303 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7695304 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7695305 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7695306 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7695307 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7695308 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7695309 lime en blauw zelf de bank is limegroen maar ik weet echt zeker dat ik er mijn stekkie van kan maken en van ga maken
7695310 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7695311 well get everybody together later this week and try to whittle it down i dont expect it to be a lot of guys im just not a big believer in huge expansion in september
7695312 well probably do that beyond that ill talk to coop a little bit about it dave and ricky and i have talked about it a couple of different times and made multiple lists and tried to whittle it down well bear down on it probably thursday or friday
7695313 actually to be honest with you ive always said there are certain stadiums that ill always associate with being in the major leagues and this is one of those places when i was a young player i remember coming to new york for the first time and playing at shea i mean it just said major leagues to me the astrodome was that way these new stadiums i guess because ive played a while theres not that awe factor the first time you come here as a rookie in new york its a huge stadium and you know the history thats associated with it you just have that feel that this is the major leagues it will be a little sad to see it go but i think it is time for a new facility
7695314 he balances the ball on his head and runs around the field which means the only way to stop him is to foul him
7695315 i wanted to do something to thank all the people who have helped and supported me throughout my life it is due to these people that i have been so fortunate to meet all of my heroes i felt the best thing i could do to give back was to raise money for cerebral palsy
7695316 all proceeds from the golf tournament will go to dr mindy aisen ceo of research and education for the cerebral palsy international research foundation dr aisen was the doctor to christopher reeve after his horseback riding accident
7695317 i plan on doing other events throughout the year but for now i am hoping everyone will come out to wildcat on sept 9

7695398 when the accusation is made jesus at first makes no reply but writes with his finger on the ground he hesitates he does not draw a line fix an interpretation tell the woman who she is and what her fate should be he allows a moment a longish moment in which people are given time to see themselves differently precisely because he refuses to make the sense they want when he lifts his head there is both judgment and release writing in the dust tries to hold that moment for a little longer long enough for some of our demons to walk away

7695415 an extraordinarily well written introduction in the study of human cognition it deals with concepts like memory recognition problem solving and perception at the end of the day this book will save an enormous amount of time by providing the necessary foundation for the books to follow
7695416 metaphor the authors explain is a fundamental mechanism of the mind one that allows us to use what we know about our physical and social experience to provide understanding of countless other subjects cognitive metaphors are how jurors interpret our case before we can hope to convince them of our version of the facts we must first activate the metaphors the jury will use to interpret those facts
7695417 this is a great foundational resource for any attorney interested in cognitive science
7695418 an understanding of how we categorize is central to any understanding of how we think and how we function and therefore central to an understanding of what makes us human for the trial attorney they matter in how the jury reasons and responds to all that we do in the courtroom
7695419 once we realize that more if not all of our behavior is the result of cognitive triggers we are prepared to explore the more meaningful questions of how to activate the jurors cognitive triggers
7695420 daniel goleman demonstrates how relationships have the power to mold not only human experience but also human biology if we read only one book on cognitive science this is it
7695421 author macolm gladwell says its a book about change in particular its a book that presents a new way of understanding why change so often happens as quickly and unexpectedly as it does for example why did crime drop so dramatically in new york city in the how does a novel written by an unknown author end up as a national bestseller people who understand the tipping point i think have a way of decoding the world around them and the juries in front of them
7695422 for the trial attorney this course allows us to explore new areas of why people do what they do and the physiological forces in play every time we enter the courtroom i watch these lectures on the treadmill because they make me look forward to exercising
7695423 as law students we were immersed in the flawed belief that reason must be exercised independent of emotion that the introduction of emotion into the reasoning process will somehow taint the results damasio lays this nonsense to rest with unassailable scientific inquiry into how human beings reason neurologically
7695424 adam blatner takes us step by step through the elements of psychodrama including techniques such as role reversal doubling and surplus reality blatners writing is clear and succinct and provides the instruction for how we use the psychodramatic skills taught at the trial lawyers college
7695425 despite the time and money spent on focus groups and market research 60 to 80 of new offerings fail why do people often say one thing in focus groups yet act differently when making real decisions harvard professor gerald zaltman argues that the answer lies in how the mind works if for no other reason this is a must read book for understanding how to conduct meaningful focus groups that open the door to the cognitive metaphors our jurors will use to reach their decisions
7695426 in why we love renowned anthropologist helen fisher offers a new map of the phenomenon of love from its origins in the brain to the havoc it creates in our bodies and behavior provocative enlightening engaging and persuasive why we love offers radical new answers to age old questions what love is who we love and how to keep love alive for the trial attorney it gives meaning to the horror we experience when our ability to love is taken from us fisher demonstrates unequivocally that love is a basic biological need
7695427 in the courtroom subtle shifts in word usage can mean the difference between success and failure
7695428 this is the one soure that puts it all together without a cognitive science background it will be difficult to follow at times but worth the effort
7695429 this book should be used in conjunction with the mind manager software available at www mindjet com we always prepare mindmaps for every phase of the trial from witness examinations opening statement and closing arguments do to pretrial motions they not only expand the way we think they create a flexible organization that is able to change with the trial
7695430 dont bite the hook is a practical step by step guide on how to not give up our power
7695431 ive got a reading list that ive been putting together for gerry spence
7695432 bill here is a reading list that should get you started down the road of cognitive science let me know when you want more by the time you are done with these you will be irrevocably addicted
7695433 as i drove down the dirt road on the way to dubois the last day of the trial lawyer s college over 12 years ago i remember feeling a sense of hope hope that i might actually be able to figure out why i do the things i do and feel the feelings i feel a hope that maybe i just might be able to figure out how to gain some semblance of control over a life that seemed to batter me about like a small boat on an angry sea and most of all a hope that rather than constantly sailing into the wind i might someday learn to sail with the wind
7695434 the last 12 years have been a remarkable journey along the way i read and studied the following books these books are some of the books that taught me how to ride with the storms and how to enjoy the sea when it is calm in the process almost as a side effect we began to see eight and nine figure results but most of all they helped make being a trial attorney a magnificent adventure
7695435 we hope this reading list will help you to sail with the wind
7695436 what is a book about baseball doing on this list
7695437 how much of our understanding of what goes on the courtroom is 19th century myth passed down from one trial attorney to the next how much is just wrong what can cognitive science teach us about how jurors think decide and act
7695438 this is the book that led me to question all that i had been taught about how to win in the courtroom in every case since i now constantly ask myself am i playing moneyball or just following some popular myth
7695439 no we are going to get drunk and listen to munson on the radio
7695440 this classic crib is designed for safety durability and style the crib features the simplest quietest mechanism for lowering and raising the guardrail when the time comes the crib converts into a toddler bed

7695465 i am here tonight to pay tribute to two men who have changed my life and the life of this country barack obama and edward m kennedy
7695466 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7695467 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7695468 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now
7695469 and i know someone else whos been inspired all over again by senator obama
7695470 more than any senator of his generation or perhaps any generation teddy has made life better for people in this country and around the world
7695471 for 46 years he has been so much more than just a senator for the people of massachusetts hes been a senator for all who believe in a dream thats never died
7695472 i tried to bunt just to tie the game on the visitors side thats kind of weird
7695473 ive never seen anything like that and hopefully we never see that again especially when you lose a game when you wait this long
7695474 washington state is doing its part to address climate change
7695475 we continue to have to litigate to force the bush administration to do its part this is another example of the epa failing to recognize the human health end environmental consequences of air pollution
7695476 its time for leaders in the other washington to do their part to address smog and global warming
7695477 the states largest source of carbon emissions is the coal fired power plant transalta in lewis county

7695485 dua kendaraan itu hanyut saat menerobos banjir di desa asam asam kecamatan jorong kedua kendaraan itu nekad menyeberang dalam kondisi arus deras
7695486 mereka berhasil selamat karena bisa bertahan pada beberada pohon di daerah banjir tersebut sampai saat ini masih dalam pencarian
7695487 saat ini daerah jalan yang tergenang banjir sudah mulai bisa dilewati namun harus pelan pelan itupun baru kendaraan besar seperti truk bis dan kendaraan lainnya
7695488 kami sudah mengusulkan dalam daftar inventaris masalah dim rancangan undang undang pajak daerah dan retribusi daerah pdrd ini ditunda pembahasannya karena menteri keuangan ingin agar penyajiannya lebih komprehensif dalam satu paket kebijakan
7695489 daerah lain yang lalu lintasnya tidak macet tidak boleh menerapkan erp dki jakarta pun harus memenuhi beberapa syarat yakni menyediakan moda transportasi massal yang nyaman dan aman serta menjamin tidak ada kemacetan di jalur erp
7695490 kenaikan tarif itu harus disertai dengan kebijakan lain yakni mengalokasikan minimal 10 persen dari total penerimaan pajak kendaraan bermotor untuk pembangunan jalan dan infrastruktur
7695491 bila ada usulan terhadap regulasi retribusi daerah menyangkut kendaraan sudah pasti akan ditolak departemen perindustrian dan pengusaha industri otomotif sebab tidak mendukung peningkatan produksi mobil nasional
7695492 mereka pasti akan menilai kenapa pemerintah menerapkan kebijakan yang tidak probisnis di tengah bergairahnya industri otomotif nasional seharusnya pemerintah menerapkan kebijakan yang terbaik agar terbangun iklim bisnis yang kondusif misalnya memberikan berbagai kemudahan dan menyiapkan infrastruktur yang memadai
7695493 apakah kenaikan itu bukan disebabkan kerusakan jalan munculnya terminal bayangan di pusat keramaian lalu lintas usia kendaraan yang sudah tua atau munculnya pasar tumpah
7695494 wait until the various parties are served and then ill make the appropriate motion to the court for expedited discovery at that point well probably have a conference call with the judge to see where and when we will be proceeding but this case because of the nature of it and because the judge said he will make an effort to keep the case moving along it needs an expedited track to overcome the normal time frame of six months to one year and beyond this case cannot take that long

7695498 demand and require that our representatives affirm the peoples election of hillary rodham clinton as our 2008 democratic nominee
7695499 since winning west virginia the clinton campaign has claimed a lead in the popular vote however the math behind this claim relies upon a number of points that have been disputed by neutral political observers and by the obama campaign most problematically the clinton campaign count gives clinton 328 309 votes and obama 0 votes in the disputed michigan primary
7695500 caucuses are undemocratic and bad because sen clinton didnt win them
7695501 rejection of conflicts of interest by delegates who have received donations from a candidate standing for the nomination
7695502 judah benjamin said on august 24th 2008 at 8 29 pm about the law suit brought by philip j berg esq my goalposts in this case have not moved one one thousandth of an inch i still believe the senator is ineligible under article ii of the constitution i still believe there is a paper trail somewhere i still believe that a large part of that is in jakarta indonesia i believe wholeheartedly that the actions of the annenberg foundation and of the senator himself give the strong impression of validating my view
7695503 but i must warn people of the following in my opinion some at least of what is alleged in the law suit is legally and factually incorrect it certainly isnt the suit i would have drafted were i a lawyer
7695504 a i am convinced that the allegation that the senator was born in kenya is untenable b i can see only the very smallest and least probable possibility that the senator is currently a kenyan citizen and i can see no possibility whatsoever that he did not lose kenyan citizenship between 1982 and 1984 if he is a kenyan citizen today it must be the result of a ministerial decree made since 1982 this view is based on kenyan law the berg suit does not seem to refer to kenyan law at all c while i believe that the colb is probably a forgery and that it must be if he was adopted by lolo soetoro in hawaii the possibility exists that he was adopted in indonesia under indonesian law prior to august 1966 in which case i could be wrong about the colb if that is the case the paper trail exists exclusively in indonesia beyond the reach of the federal courts or bergs action i have said this before
7695505 it still might be true but in indonesia where we cant follow boo hoo
7695506 d i asked polarik why the campaign did not use a
7695507 e i said and i repeat maya kassandra soetoro ng was born in jakarta indonesia in 1970 therefore and by definition she could not possess a valid legal hawaiian colb i wondered how she acquired us citizenship i now know to a 75 level of certainty and it has nothing to do with a forged colb there is an entirely different story behind it which also has nothing to do with her mothers citizenship that story does involve more editing of history
7695508 omg shes obamas sister she must be guilty of something
7695509 f i pondered at the outset of my investigation if the whole point of the exercise might not be to secure the candidacy of some person who would otherwise not get it
7695510 the survey results would suggest that anwar will not lose but he may not do exceptionally well either
7695511 we have decided to quit the coalition and sit on the opposition benches in parliament
7695512 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled
7695513 i dont anticipate it would have any impact on our joint efforts to combat extremism
7695514 who threaten the stability not only in pakistran but also
7695515 the ppp also violated the latest agreement reached earlier this month that the judges will be restored 24 hours after the resignation of musharraf
7695516 the ppp even nominated zardari for president and announced the election schedule without consulting our party
7695517 struggle for restoration of the judges and supreme court chief justice to challenge zardari in the september 6 presidential candidate
7695518 he is a good pakistani who is a non partisan person
7695519 despite the break up of the coalition both parties should continue to work for the stability of the country
7695520 we will play the role of constructive opposition and will not create hurdles for the ppp government
7695521 we are sad over s decision we want to move together and solve the problems facing the nation we will request nawaz sharif to return to the government
7695522 i will vote for anwar he represents the voice of the people god willing he will win
7695523 how do i love my needles let me count the ways
7695524 it has brought a new sense of purpose and excitement to our firm we implemented needles in conjunction with a new marketing campaign to assist us in dealing with an anticipated high call volume thank goodness we did
7695525 it allows me to compete with the larger firms on the same level of control and process of information
7695526 now at any rate he is as bad an orc and just an enemy he deserves death
7695527 but i do not choose now to do what i came to do i will not do this deed the ring is mine
7695528 behind that there was something else at work beyond any design of the ring maker i can put it no plainer than by saying that bilbo was meant to find the ring and not by its maker in which case you also were meant to have it and that may be an encouraging thought
7695529 but you have been chosen and you must therefore use such strength and heart and wits as you have
7695530 always after a defeat and a respite the shadow takes another shape and grows again
7695531 i wish it need not have happened in my time
7695532 and so do all who live to see such times but that is not for them to decide all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us
7695533 he was interested in roots and beginnings he dived into deep pools he burrowed under trees and growing plants he tunneled into green mounds and he ceased to look up at the hill top or the leaves on trees or the flowers opening in the air his head and his eyes were downward
7695534 i do not choose now to do what i came to do
7695535 what a pity that bilbo did not stab that vile creature when he had a chance
7695536 pity it was pity that stayed his hand pity and mercy not to strike without need and he has been well rewarded frodo

7695542 these abnormal features of tumor vessels impair delivery of circulating chemotherapeutic drugs to the actual tumor site
7695543 because high cell density increases contractility across the entire cell layer these findings suggested that tumor capillary cells are inherently hyper contractile
7695544 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7695545 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
7695546 weve become very good at growing some bacterial species what might be called the weeds of the microbial world
7695547 but many other species cant be cultured by current methods
7695548 although we know now that humans should respect and even cherish their microbial symbionts
7695549 this type of infection reflects a situation in which our microbial companions have overstepped their bounds something has gone awry with this balance
7695550 this discovery may eventually lead to enhanced understanding of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit disorder all conditions in which a persons ability to remember and change such rules is impaired
7695551 this indicates that different parts of our brains store different kinds of memories and information
7695552 provides clues about how the human brain accomplishes complex goal directed behaviors that require remembering and changing abstract rules an ability that is disrupted in many mental illnesses
7695553 these experiments validate the ns1 pocket as a target for antiviral drug discovery
7695554 because this ns1 pocket is highly conserved in all influenza a viruses isolated from humans a drug targeted to the pocket would be effective against all human influenza a strains including the bird flu
7695555 in the best case scenario this would open up the window of time that people could recover and go back to normal functional status
7695556 the russia georgia conflict has transformed the contemporary geopolitical world with large consequences for peace and security in europe and beyond russias disproportionate counter attack with movement of large forces into abkhazia and deep into georgia accompanied by the widespread destruction of economic infrastructure damage to the economy and disruption of communications and movement between different regions of the country constitutes a dramatic shift in russian western relations it has undermined regional stability and security threatened energy corridors that are vital for europe made claims with respect to ethnic russians and other minorities that could be used to destabilise other parts of the former soviet union with ukraine a potential target and shown disregard for international law
7695557 russian actions reflected deeper factors including pushback against the decade long eastward expansion of the nato alliance anger over issues ranging from the independence of kosovo to the placement of missile defence systems in europe an assertion of a concept of limited sovereignty for former soviet states and a newfound confidence and aggressiveness in foreign affairs that is intimately linked with the personality and world view of russias predominant leader prime minister vladimir putin
7695558 western actions or policies should be modified in the future to avoid worsening the problem of russias
7695559 securing russias cooperation in opposing irans march toward a nuclear weapon pressuring north korea to give up its nuclear arsenal and trying to keep the peace in south and central asia are top level priorities we make a mistake by needlessly picking fights over secondary things if that harms our ability to cooperate on truly crucial matters
7695560 we are in a predicament to continue down the path of likely nato membership for georgia and ukraine would risk causing even worse troubles with russia over a second tier geostrategic issue when we need moscows help in first tier issues not to mention the fact that were georgia in nato and then again attacked by russia we would have a huge and dangerous predicament on our hands yet we cannot capitulate to russian bullying and deny georgia and ukraine membership out of fear either in this situation two principles should guide further u s action first we should avoid rushing to do anything the best policy will avoid committing to major enduring decisions on matters such as nato membership since it is time for tempers to cool and provocations to cease among georgians and russians second we need a new concept for expanding nato perhaps it is time to consider russian membership not now of course and probably never with mr putin or mr medvedev in power but someday at least russia might be offered the option assuming it satisfies nato membership criteria even as we emphasize to moscows future leaders that they will have no veto over the possible membership of others
7695561 russia may no longer be a superpower but despite its declining population it remains a major power one in a position to influence the opening decades of the 21st century russia possesses approximately half the worlds
7695562 russia is back china has emerged suddenly the united states isnt the worlds only superpower

7695567 things really happen like that and im very happy that im back
7695568 i know from the beginning the president and the dfa secretary have nothing to do with what happened thats one thing im very sure of
7695569 it leaked maybe because of the excitement of many friends of cristina ponce enrile that shes going to be appointed to the vatican to take my place but its ok things happen like that
7695570 it was very uplifting that the cbcp was behind me i found out that they really appreciated my work
7695571 tita nida comes home to us as she left us whole there is reason to give thanks because not all public officials like tita nida finish government service like her
7695572 some leave government because their names have been tainted by scandal some leave government because they did something wrong to the people they represented
7695573 the coming of tita nida is an encouragement for those in the public service it is an inspiration for those in public service that someday your turn will come
7695574 the peace negotiations cease to be authentic when it is used to extend the administrations term of office or if it exploits the current situation to push us closer to emergency rule
7695575 as women religious we say no to these maneuverings and selfish designs
7695576 from our eyes of faith they are gods anawim belonging to the same family as the poor among christians and lumads in mindanao
7695577 the peace is the fruit of justice in todays context the church further clarifies that peace is the fruit of solidarity
7695578 we had to constantly break down barriers and perceptions of what women can do
7695579 i think that was really an important action that will help solidify the party
7695580 if they really want to win this is the way we have to do it
7695581 i just think its a tremendous occasion for all americans especially women
7695582 this is not between hillary clinton and barack obama its between john mccain and barack obama
7695583 really if we live in a just world this will be the end of joe bidens political career
7695584 the are more and less charitable readings of what biden said but theres no way to read it which doesnt reflect very poorly on biden
7695585 i think at this point you have to say that biden suffers from what one might with real generosity call chronic racial grandpaism that is to say the penchant for making comments that are not only racially offensive but also extremely silly
7695586 we grieve for the many lives lost in the still ongoing armed conflict in many of our mission areas we are currently accompanying thousands of internally displaced people as they struggle to secure themselves and their families in cramped classrooms public facilities and shared homes of relatives
7695587 we express concern that if the current all out war offensives of the government which comprises of air strikes indiscriminate shelling and militarization of communities will continue without let up we will be faced with a humanitarian crisis of massive proportions
7695588 anguish women and children who will be most vulnerable and traumatized in situations of all out offensives not to mention its lasting adverse effects on the environment
7695589 at a time when the people have nothing to eat because of the grave economic crisis and food shortages all out war is simply a senseless and costly recourse of the arroyo government
7695590 a grave injustice has dawned upon the moro people with the obvious failure of the arroyo government to show sincerity in its peace negotiations with the moro islamic liberation front milf
7695591 alleged violations of the laws of war by the milf in its recent attacks particularly in lanao del norte should be dealt with accordingly under its own processes
7695592 we support calls for an interfaith fact finding and mercy mission in conflict areas to show our solidarity and pastoral concern for the displaced
7695593 for a return of all parties to the negotiating table to sincerely thresh out differences and strive to address the roots of the bangsamoro problem
7695594 its a shame she didnt get to speak because shes a dynamic speaker
7695595 when thousands of peoples is riled up to see you that could arouse your ego
7695596 we got mouths to feed though gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
7695597 they gotta put your face on a 5 000 bill
7695598 im just gonna speak to simon the way i speak to everybody
7695599 im just gonna have my opinion be honest and i dont foresee any problems im really excited about this and up for the challenge
7695600 its really flattering too you know to think that idol even thought about me
7695601 i mean when i got the call i thought they were calling the wrong person so im the and im hoping everyones gonna go easy on me and that i bring a lot to the table
7695602 im maybe not a household name but people know of me in the industry
7695603 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7695604 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7695605 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7695606 id say i believe in what i believe in and im willing to fight for it and im pretty feisty
7695607 the bottom line from my perspective is the surgery went well
7695608 right now its a rough day for him but everything went well
7695609 he was fixing to be a big part of this team and to go out there on that field and see this kid laying there after what he went through was tough
7695610 we were talking about it this morning you can be out there in one play and it can be over for you just like that
7695611 i talked to cedric the other day and he told me how well hes doing
7695612 were rooting for him and i just cant wait to see him walk through those practice gates
7695613 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7695614 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7695615 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7695616 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7695617 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7695618 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
7695619 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
7695620 on an exhale from the belly body downward dog using the entire breath to get there

7695625 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7695626 the act of helping a bottle re fulfill its destiny
7695627 i could no more denounce an admitted terrorist than i could my own grandmother
7695628 that i am able to add a coach with the experience and credentials of jeff ruland to my staff is exciting
7695629 hell be an invaluable resource for our players particularly our big men and an asset to the organization as a whole
7695630 im excited to re join the 76ers and have the opportunity to help the organization reach the goal of winning a championship as well as return to a city that is very close to me and my family
7695631 i owe a lot to the thunderbirds and the ownership there sam bregman and david kahn played a large part in my move back to the nba i am a shining example of how the nba development league continues to prosper and promote not only players but coaches as well
7695632 why do people get jealous when others love the same one they love
7695633 god help us learn to love like you intended as a body working together giving all credit to the very one who defined love from the beginning
7695634 i will be coach while the club wants me and while i want to be here
7695635 as soon as one of us doesnt think im the right man for the job it is time to move on
7695636 if the club wanted me to leave this year i would leave
7695637 the win loss ratio is the only thing a coach can be judged on
7695638 people can have judgment calls and they might be right but most people think the coach has more control on a game of football than he actually does and i say that whether we have won or lost i think the coaching contribution is overrated
7695639 our defensive group have come through unheralded and yet they have played enough good footy for you to think we have under performed this year
7695640 we just feel as a combination that schneider and milne are quite effective
7695641 where do you find a stephen milne it was a relief not to make that change
7695642 you learn not to take things for granted and i think the way that myself and even stephen milne have come back since being dropped has been positive for the club and weve won a few more games so thats always nice
7695643 its not great to look at his face but it was great to have him out there against adelaide
7695644 i thought he played really well again and obviously hes had a pretty tough week but the way hes handled himself even last week coming off with the cheekbone and finishing off the game and the travel this week and then playing the game was fantastic
7695645 he contributes really well and gives us another avenue to goal which we really need
7695646 we probably havent put a full game together which weve been really happy with but theres definitely three quarters or half a game which is how wed like to play our football
7695647 i think weve been putting some good scores on the board and also stopping the opposition so if we can do that for four quarters well give ourselves every chance to be successful
7695648 i think playing a team youve lost to pretty soon after is a good thing its always nice to try to get one back you missed out on
7695649 they always say you learn a bit more from your losses than you do from your wins but if that was to happen id really look forward to that
7695650 the precipitous rise and fall of lobotomy raises important questions about medical innovation
7695651 at what point do interventions meant to alleviate suffering begin to conflict with essential human qualities

7695818 every now and then something comes along that changes peoples perception of what is possible we at hiper3 feel that the aviva ironman 70 3 singapore has already changed peoples perception of triathlon across the asian region it has set the bench mark that all other 70 3 races should aspire to reach
7695819 it is only fitting then that hiper3 uses this event to change another perception the dynamic of triathlon has long since been that it is an individual racing for their own goals and rewards we will be bringing a concept that looks to bring a number of potential winners to a race that will not only look for individual glory but have a focus on a wider goal of team success

7695837 unitedhealthcare respects the relationship between a patient and physician and understands that it is ultimately their decision whether to seek a particular treatment when we administer health benefits on behalf of an employer we rely on published peer reviewed medical literature to determine whether or not a particular health service is supported by the clinical community and then must also verify whether its covered based on the members benefit plan unfortunately a stem cell transplant to treat kyles condition is not currently supported by national clinical guidelines and as a result is not covered under his benefit plan an external medical review was also performed by a third party outside of unitedhealthcare and that group also determined that there are no published studies that support a stem cell transplant for this condition

7695850 nosotros no buscamos el favor de los dirigentes trabajamos mucho todos los d as para poder llegar con beneficios al productor y lo estamos haciendo como nunca antes a n despu s de la tormenta de cuatro meses que tuvimos en el pa s
7695851 todos los productores quieren tener una actividad que deje buenas ganancias nadie quiere dejar de hacer lo que ha hecho siempre pero el campo ha sido invadido por formas de producci n que atentan contra la permanencia de la familia en el campo yo conozco las historias del gaucho que a los 60 o 70 a os vende sus 100 hect reas su arado y su tractor y les reparte un poco a cada uno de sus cuatro o cinco hijos y todos con sus familias se van a la ciudad
7695852 no vinimos a demonizar ning n tipo de producci n agropecuaria todas son v lidas la soja tambi n porque en esta entre r os maravillosa es eficiente el que produce trigo ma z lino arroz soja miel leche o ganado no s lo por los recursos naturales sino porque vienen con una cultura del trabajo con una ense anza de sus padres que no encontramos en todas las provincias entre r os es toda productiva
7695853 pero yo les puedo asegurar por muchas razones rememor principalmente por mi origen por mi ense anza y porque me cri entre las cosas simples del campo que jam s a este gobernador ni a ninguno de sus funcionarios se les ocurri perjudicar al sector agropecuario ni a ning n productor se lo dije varias veces a los productores y al que hoy lidera alfredo de angeli con quien tuve esta semana una charla en la calle solos sin custodia sin alcahuetes y sin nadie mano a mano yo con ellos hablando como me gusta hablar a m y como les gusta hablar a ellos
7695854 yo no le temo a ning n sector de la sociedad que quiera recriminarme algo lo que s le pido y le exijo es que me d la oportunidad de dialogar respetuosamente como lo hicimos hace 48 horas en la calle y cuando alg n productor quiso levantarme la voz fue el se or de angeli el que le baj el copete y tambi n tuve que poner en su lugar a m s de uno
7695855 la producci n se diversifica usando herramientas tiles que pone a disposici n el estado y gracias a dios cada d a tenemos m s de esas herramientas para que la gente de campo siga viviendo del campo y en el campo
7695856 estamos ejecutando un programa de riego para tener citricultura y arrozales bajo sistemas intensivos estamos electrificando el coraz n arrocero de la provincia para tener con riego y electricidad el arroz m s competitivo del mundo tenemos que recuperar esas 100 000 hect reas de arroz que perdimos y volver a ocupar el 56 de los molinos arroceros que est n ociosos
7695857 estamos generando el programa de rutas troncales y vecinales m s importante de la historia de entre r os
7695858 conseguimos ahora dos millones de pesos para ayudar a los productores afectados por la sequ a estamos comprando una nueva cosechadora de algod n para ayudar a los productores de feliciano empezamos la reconstrucci n del ferrocarril de carga en entre r os para ir m s barato a nuestros puertos de exportaci n desde el mi rcoles est a disposici n una l nea de cr dito para arroceros a tasas negativas
7695859 sta es la manera que entre r os va a salir adelante no con discursos lindos con fotos de ocasi n con sobadas de lomo ni yendo para donde calienta el sol sino haciendo lo que durante d cadas nuestros viejos y nuestros abuelos nos ense aron que no es otra cosa que trabajar
7695860 de coraz n les pido d ganles a sus hijos a sus hermanos a sus familiares que nadie va a impedir que este gobierno provincial intente todo por nuestra producci n agropecuaria hay muchos picos que hablan y no entienden nada de esto hay algunos picos que hablan de esto pero entre un grano de soja y una sand a no saben cu l es cual
7695861 en esto nos va la vida a m me interesan muy poco los palcos o los carteles lo que nos interesa es poder comparar dentro de un tiempo donde est bamos cuando arrancamos y donde estamos

7695933 most worshipful king solomon we come to inform you that fifteen of us fellow crafts seeing the temple about to be completed and being desirous of obtaining the secrets of a master mason by which we might travel in foreign countries and receive masters wages entered into a horrid conspiracy to extort them from our grand master hiram abiff or take his life but reflecting with horror on the atrocity of the crime twelve of us recanted but the other three persisted in their murderous design and we fear that they have taken the grand masters life we therefore now appear before your majesty clothed with white gloves and aprons in token of our innocence and acknowledging our premeditated guilt we humbly implore your pardon
7695934 most worshipful king solomon i being one of those who pursued a westerly course coming down near the port of joppa met a seafaring man of whom i inquired if he had seen any strangers pass that way he informed me that he had
7695935 this is very unjust of the king we are told if we do not find the ruffians we must be punished put to death probably what have we done it is very true we have been associated with these three ruffians but we have not committed any actual crime
7695936 well brothers i am very weary i must sit down and rest before i can go any farther
7695937 what course shall we pursue we must not go and report ourselves if we do the twelve will be put to death here are three of the poor fellows with us we must not go and give them up to be put to death rather let us take a northwesterly or a southwesterly course which way shall we go
7695938 we will go a southwesterly course and will come up with our brothers
7695939 what means this acacia coming up so easily the ground has been newly broken this has the appearance of a grave
7695940 oh that my throat had been cut across my tongue torn out by its roots and buried in the rough sands of the sea at low water mark where the tide ebbs and flows twice in twenty four hours ere i had been accessory to the death of so good a man as our grand master hiram abiff
7695941 oh that my breast had been torn open my heart plucked out and placed upon the highest pinnacle of the temple there to be devoured by the vultures of the air ere i had consented to the death of so good a man as our grand master hiram abiff
7695942 oh that my body had been severed in two my bowels taken from thence and burned to ashes the ashes scattered to the four winds of heaven that no more remembrance might be had of so vile and wicked a wretch as i ah jubela jubelo it was i 113 that struck him harder than you both it was i that gave him the fatal blow it was i that killed him
7695943 what shall we do there are three of them and only three of us
7695944 most worshipful king solomon i being one who pursued a westerly course and on my return after several days of fruit less search being more weary than my companions sat down on the brow of a hill to rest and refresh myself and on rising accidentally caught hold of a sprig of acacia 1 which easily giving way excited my suspicions having my curiosity aroused i examined it and found it to be a grave
7695945 most worshipful king solomon while sitting down to rest and refresh ourselves we heard the following horrid exclamations from the clefts of the adjacent rocks the first was the voice of jubela exclaiming oh that my throat had been cut across 114 my tongue torn out by its roots and buried in the rough sands of the sea at low water mark where the tide ebbs and flows twice in twenty four hours ere i had been accessory to the death of so good a man as our grand master hiram abiff the second was that of jubelo exclaiming oh that my breast had been torn open my heart plucked out and placed upon the highest pinnacle of the temple there to be devoured by the vultures of the air ere i had consented to the death of so good a man as our grand master hiram abiff the third was the voice of jubelum exclaiming louder than the rest it was i that gave the fatal blow it was i that killed him oh that my body had been severed in two my bowels taken from thence and burned to ashes the ashes scattered to the four winds of heaven that no more remembrance might be had of so vile and wicked a wretch as i ah jubela jubelo it was i that struck him harder than you both it was i that gave him the fatal blow it was i that killed him upon which we rushed in seized and bound the ruffians and now have them before your majesty
7695946 most worshipful king solomon your orders have been duly executed upon the three murderers of grand master hiram abiff
7695947 well brothers can we find where the acacia was pulled up
7695948 yes this is the place let us remove the rubbish and dig down here
7695949 yes here is the body of our grand master hiram abiff in a mangled and putrid state let us go and report but what were our orders we were ordered to observe whether the masters word or a key to it or any thing appertaining to the masters degree was on or about the body but brothers we are only fellow crafts and know nothing about the masters word or a key to it or any thing appertaining to the masters 116 paragraph continues degree we must however make an examination or we will be put to death
7695950 let us go and report that we find nothing on or about the body excepting the jewel of his office
7695951 this is the jewel of our grand master hiram abiff there can be no longer any doubt as to the identity of the body
7695952 my worthy brother of tyre as the masters word is now lost the first sign given at the grave and the first word spoken after the body is raised shall be adopted for the regulation of all masters lodges until future generations shall find out the right
7695953 o lord my god i fear the masters word is forever lost
7695954 solemn strikes the funeral chime notes of our departing time as we journey here below through a pilgrimage of woe
7695955 lord of all below above fill our hearts with truth and love when dissolves our earthly tie take us to thy lodge on high
7695956 o lord my god i fear the masters word is forever lost
7695957 you will take the body by the entered apprentice grip and see if it can be raised
7695958 most worshipful king solomon owing to the high state of putrefaction it having been dead already fifteen days the skin slips and the body cannot be raised

7695966 if you try to fear and smear your way to the presidency it aint going to work some of john mccains ads have been so over the top and pathetic he literally should ask for his money back from his consultant because theyre just not going to work

7695968 his ability to talk directly about economic issues will be very important for southwestern pennsylvania
7695969 increasingly looks to be a tight race for the white house employing such an unconventional electoral map is more than desirable for the democrats it may be a necessity
7695970 betting that this time colorado and the west may just go their way in recent years democratic governors have replaced republicans in what used to be solidly red montana wyoming new mexico arizona and colorado
7695971 with its nine electoral votes and a surging population colorado may be the bellwether state

7695977 the results in beijing have lifted the curse of dashed expectations that so often hangs over british sport now we need to build on this by getting more young people involved in sport
7695978 the research is clear if developed countries spent the same amount of money on preventing deforestation and the destruction of peatlands as they do on misguided biofuel subsidies 15 billion us dollars this would halve the total costs of tackling climate change
7695979 this report is timely and welcome it is becoming increasingly clear that unless we find a practical solution to the problems caused by deforestation the battle against climate change is in danger of being lost
7695980 this pressure initially confined mainly to consumer services such as hospitality and travel has now spread to the professional and business services sector covering areas such as marketing and legal services

7695992 the results contradict almost every benefit claimed for campus diversity students faculty members and administrators all responded to increasing racial diversity by registering increased dissatisfaction with the quality of education and the work ethic of their peers students also increasingly complained about discrimination
7695993 a higher level of diversity is associated with somewhat less educational satisfaction and worse race relations among students

7696016 es hora de que los arque logos comiencen a buscar otras razones de la extinci n de los neandertales y la supervivencia de nuestros antepasados
7696017 i feel this is the beginning of the new era in parliament the era probably when the executive has to find ways of negotiating with the legislature in order to put through programs
7696018 obviously as a party we are fully aware that we find ourselves in a situation where we have somebody claiming to be head of state which we know very well did not win that head of state
7696019 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7696020 an insult to all americans democrats as well as republicans
7696021 there ought to be no place in the political and social discourse of american culture for such deliberate distortions and lies sure to be viewed by hundreds of thousands of young people around the world
7696022 but each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey
7696023 and i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me my mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion and her intelligence reflected in my own daughters
7696024 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7696025 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7696026 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7696027 i am here tonight to pay tribute to two men who have changed my life and the life of this country barack obama and edward m
7696028 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now

7696042 you just have to deal with it theres no other option
7696043 i was a little surprised but ive had some time to digest it and ill be ready to go

7696045 because what if the kids had of been outside or what if they would have went in the school you know
7696046 we did receive a call saying that an individual had been shot in the stomach
7696047 she was scared she said they had to hide under the desk
7696048 the school was lockdown just to ensure the safety of the children in case there was some substance to the call
7696049 and theyre really hoping and asking that residents in the area will let us know if they know of any criminal activity so that we can make a movement to try to stamp out some of this violence
7696050 weve heard criticism from across the country including representatives of the medical community that mr epps bill as presently drafted could be interpreted as instilling fetal rights let me be clear our government will not reopen the debate on abortion
7696051 for this reason im announcing that the government will introduce legislation that will punish criminals who commit violence against pregnant women but do so in a way that leaves no room for the introduction of fetal rights
7696052 the term is used in such a derogatory way in society at this point and time
7696053 because mental retardation is one of the developmental disabilities that a person could have
7696054 some people want to avoid receiving our services because of the high level of stigma attached to our name
7696055 at this point retardation has taken on the same level of connotation as idiot moron and imbecile have taken on
7696056 the real answer that i dont think will change in my lifetime is that people with disabilities become so accepted in society that no one would think about using a term that refers to people with disabilities in that kind of a manner
7696057 until we get everybodys attitude changed we are just going to need to change the term every 30 40 years

7696063 i have realised this for a number of times many ugandans are given sh1 000 to pretend to be blind during voting time such that the person who paid the money can help him or her cast the vote as he wishes
7696064 even people who are capable and sure of winning an election have succumbed to the crooks who give them as low as sh5m to stand down in their favour
7696065 that is why they have insisted on using a one sided electoral commission which helps them to play their deals as they wish
7696066 fdc is not like the nrm which deceives people that an election can be held with one of the contestants holding the same post he or she is campaigning for we shall all stand down and if some people are re elected they will resume their work
7696067 it feels really special great to see friends and some of my family here
7696068 i am really touched that that moment reached out and touched other people in canada as well as at the olympics

7696070 right now im just going to relax a little bit and probably be back training in a month or two
7696071 i think in every athletes career theres a lot of ups and downs you take the ups and learn from the downs i think ill just continue doing that and see how far that takes me but i dont know if itll take me all the way to 2012
7696072 its a little early to think it 2012 im just coming off these games its pretty exciting and i just want to take that all in
7696073 i always knew she was the best in the world and now im happy everyone gets to see that
7696074 im not sure what to expect but im excited and ill enjoy my minutes of fame or whatever it gives me
7696075 i realize im in a position to be a role model for young people so im looking forward to that
7696076 how can you stand there with your guns aimed at us waiting to arrest us when you know expletive well bush is a criminal who needs to be arrested
7696077 they must be pointed out for the traitors that they are to their own families
7696078 when it starts to come here and it starts to come home it makes people uncomfortable
7696079 were being treated by the city of denver and the secret service like political prisoners like pariahs
7696080 eventually theyll have to start sweeping a couple of series but i think the minimums got to be two out of three
7696081 i draw a circle of peace i give my peaceful energy to places on the planet calling for harmony
7696082 we only know the engine had problems and they did not make a successful landing
7696083 theres not a thing he can do at this point were working with the u s embassy to have all of the arrangements made for the repatriation of those who are deceased and medical flights for those living
7696084 there were farmers in the field where they crashed they pulled my husband out of the plane 30 seconds before the plane exploded
7696085 he has constant pain he says he can deal with hes just grateful to be alive
7696086 he did everything he was a carpenter a multipurpose utility player he was a very popular employee forever upbeat
7696087 he was very giving i think he was in africa last year
7696088 on november 4 2008 the american people will trek to the polls to elect the 44th president of the united states from the inception of the republic america has only elected white anglo saxon protestant males with the exception of john kennedy an irish catholic from the state of massachusetts who was elected in 1960 in this presidential year there is the possibility of a woman a mormon an italian american catholic or an african american could be elected president of the united states of america this is americas historical moment
7696089 do you have a vision of victory for your life do you get up each morning knowing that god has great things in store for you or are you letting the pains of yesterday destroy your hopes for tomorrow when you stop focusing on your disappointments hurts and pains god will fill your life with joy hope and satisfaction the bible says hell do more than you could ask or think god has an abundant life in store for you god wants you to be happy
7696090 we fully expect that both the number of suspected and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues and samples continue to be tested
7696091 he has several medical problems all interacting with each other and has a long way to go
7696092 both he and lynne are very happy with the care he is receiving and the australian embassy has been very supportive
7696093 its better news today because its been a couple of terrible days
7696094 overall an immensely enjoyable experience and it could well become a piece of electronic art that may be a required listen in the near future
7696095 building up tension through clever drum programming and a heightened sense of atmosphere each track ups the ante for the album as a whole while being complete in and of themselves
7696096 we have a feeling that they have split up and went different ways from finding some of the jumpsuits throughout the city
7696097 are looking at every family and background friend of the suspects and they will continue to do that until they hopefully capture these individuals
7696098 to get tunnel vision on where one suspect might be going we could actually miss the lead on another one
7696099 i cant comment on went wrong at this time if anything went wrong at all
7696100 the escapees are more of a threat right now than how they did it or how they got up to the roof
7696101 the son of man came not to be served but to serve
7696102 i want to hear him talking about the right to life the sanctity of marriage second amendment rights and lower taxes
7696103 i think he received it as advice from a friend
7696104 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7696105 in fact some officials also seem comfortable in the role of theologian
7696106 political issue but as a matter of accuracy and justice
7696107 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7696108 since speaker pelosi has in her words studied the issue
7696109 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7696110 abortion kills an unborn developing human life it is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves and abuse the fidelity of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith

7696115 you see the beleivers as regards their being merciful among themselves and showing love among themselves and being kind resembling one body so that if any part of the body is not well then the whole body shares the sleeplessness insomnia and fever with it
7696116 he who is not merciful to others will not be treated mercifully

7696120 all obvious moves look dubious in analysis after the game
7696121 we have decided to quit the coalition and sit on the opposition benches in parliament
7696122 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled
7696123 i dont anticipate it would have any impact on our joint efforts to combat extremism
7696124 who threaten the stability not only in pakistran but also afghanistan
7696125 the ppp also violated the latest agreement reached earlier this month that the judges will be restored 24 hours after the resignation of musharraf

7696138 as americas oldest professional ballet company we felt that it was important to take the company out to america
7696139 the tendency for the american dancers was to go to new york to have a career
7696140 so it was basically accidental that foreign dancers auditioned for me here or sent videotapes i needed dancers so i hired them what they bring is part of their heritage
7696141 i thought she had a beautiful quality on stage beautifully trained
7696142 its generated just the kind of debate we looked forward to in terms of presenting new works
7696143 this pressure initially confined mainly to consumer services such as hospitality and travel has now spread to the professional and business services sector covering areas such as marketing and legal services

7696217 its nothing to do with priorities or which orchestra is better it was decided to split the work between the two orchestras
7696218 its quite a normal practice and if the olympics had been in melbourne the sydney symphony would have been involved im sure of that

7696276 the prose and poetry of it all or dippy verses
7696277 i dont much enjoy analyzing my own work its sobering enough to see what curious things my novels say to other people never mind what they say to me

7696282 he balances the ball on his head and runs around the field which means the only way to stop him is to foul him
7696283 if you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs
7696284 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7696285 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7696286 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7696287 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7696288 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7696289 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7696290 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7696291 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7696292 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7696293 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7696294 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7696295 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7696296 for example when americans gain a reputation for needing to do things very quickly it can foster an attitude in poor communities that discourages local people from doing things to improve their own situation
7696297 we dont need to do anything lets just wait and some outsiders will show up and do it for us
7696298 the stm trip must be seen as one small part of a wider learning process that includes both pre and post trip training
7696299 the mindset of participating in missions as a learner and one who is going to partner with othe rlocal christians in the process of transformation must be fostered before during and after the trip

7696301 what is the role of jesus in the kingdom according to what you see here
7696302 maybe we are a little bit crazy maybe we are just bored
7696303 portuguese players like all the glamour perfume look all nice and here people just get down and get dirty
7696304 this is bizarre but when you think about it it makes training so much more fun
7696305 the sport is also a symbolical mental liberation from the restraining yoke of being constantly within reach
7696306 its our nature to create fun happenings probably because our summers are so short
7696307 at first it was difficult to promote them as they were small local events where people did not speak any foreign language
7696308 but now they are raising the interest of foreign press and visitors probably because they are so different from anything else going in their own countries
7696309 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7696310 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7696311 in the process of expanding in europe germany is one of several possible future markets
7696312 we receive inquiries from all over the world there is enormous interest in current
7696313 according to our observations germany is a market that could soon be ripe for current
7696314 tv and the web amount to the same thing to us
7696315 unlike most broadcasters we do not only use television to attract people to the internet on the contrary people go to current com swap thoughts concerns and videos and then we bring the best of it to the tv screen
7696316 i like what he says and theres something about him i trust im going to take a chance on him
7696317 the survey suggests that this the economy is an umbrella issue covering many other concerns including those relative to health care
7696318 if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system
7696319 given that a lot of people work for insurance companies a lot of people work for hmos youve got a whole system of institutions that have been set up
7696320 we wish george bush could serve us another 8 years in the same stellar manner he served us the last but alas our great constitution which he has worked so hard to uphold will not allow that we realize now that he has the rest of the world pretty much straightened out that he could complete his domestic agenda if he had the time
7696321 i believe that every american has the right to affordable health care i believe that the millions of americans who cant take their children to a doctor when they get sick have that right we now face an opportunity and an obligation to turn the page on the failed politics of yesterdays health care debates its time to bring together businesses the medical community and members of both parties around a comprehensive solution to this crisis and its time to let the drug and insurance industries know that while theyll get a seat at the table they dont get to buy every chair
7696322 and nothing illustrates obamas failure so far to put some meat on his campaign than his inability to nail mccain on this issue and to speak specifically and powerfully about his own excellent plan which he announced early in the campaign

7696342 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7696343 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7696344 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7696345 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7696346 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7696347 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7696348 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7696349 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7696350 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7696351 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7696352 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7696353 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7696354 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7696355 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly

7696365 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
7696366 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
7696367 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
7696368 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
7696369 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7696370 it could be good for the nation if other corporate companies could emulate what standard bank has done to work with undp on an issue that is of national and global concern
7696371 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7696372 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7696373 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7696374 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7696375 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7696376 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7696377 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7696378 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7696379 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7696380 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7696381 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7696382 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7696383 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7696384 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7696385 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7696386 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7696387 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7696388 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7696389 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7696390 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7696391 the four day conference was intended to boost the capabilities of the youth
7696392 the event was also designed to encourage them to demonstrate their national pride and to stay in school because the future of iraq is in their hands
7696393 education and sports go hand in hand in a kids learning process
7696394 its important for the kids to know that there are youth activities available to them during the summer months when schools are not in session
7696395 the skills learned while they are still young will affect the future of iraq in a very competitive world
7696396 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant
7696397 should and will take actions to reduce the emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions
7696398 coal will continue to play a large and indispensable role in a greenhouse gas constrained world

7696402 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7696403 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7696404 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7696405 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7696406 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7696407 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7696408 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7696409 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7696410 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7696411 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7696412 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7696413 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7696414 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7696415 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7696416 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7696417 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7696418 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7696419 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7696420 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7696421 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7696422 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7696423 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7696424 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7696425 ill refrain from reviewing the machine until i have something good to say i will say that the software is light years from being complete
7696426 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7696427 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7696428 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7696429 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7696430 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7696431 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7696432 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7696433 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7696434 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7696435 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7696436 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7696437 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7696438 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7696439 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7696440 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7696441 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7696442 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7696443 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7696444 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7696445 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7696446 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7696447 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7696448 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7696449 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7696450 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7696451 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7696452 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7696453 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7696454 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7696455 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7696456 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7696457 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7696458 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7696459 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7696460 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7696461 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7696462 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7696463 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7696464 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7696465 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7696466 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7696467 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7696468 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7696469 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7696470 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7696471 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7696472 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7696473 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7696474 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7696475 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7696476 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7696477 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7696478 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7696479 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7696480 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7696481 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7696482 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7696483 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7696484 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7696485 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7696486 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7696487 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
7696488 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7696489 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7696490 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7696491 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7696492 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7696493 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7696494 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7696495 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7696496 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7696497 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7696498 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7696499 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7696500 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7696501 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7696502 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7696503 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7696504 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7696505 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7696506 well they were just going through his pockets he didnt have to shoot that little boy
7696507 as they approached they noticed one of the males a 17 year old had what appeared to be the butt of a gun sticking from his waistband area
7696508 they ordered him not to move to drop it but as he reached for the firearm one officer discharged
7696509 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7696510 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7696511 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7696512 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7696513 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7696514 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7696515 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7696516 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7696517 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7696518 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7696519 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7696520 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7696521 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7696522 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7696523 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7696524 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7696525 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7696526 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7696527 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7696528 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7696529 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7696530 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7696531 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7696532 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7696533 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7696534 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7696535 all management staff has quit within the last three months
7696536 the two founders of bon app tit come on site at least once a week
7696537 other representatives from bon app tit headquarters are on site every day as visitors its a very sticky situation the kitchen staff isnt being told anything when dinner is cut how many jobs will be cut too the thing that really gets me is that the googlers have no clue and will be asking us questions when dinner and other programs stop they wont know the truth either
7696538 i expect that number of claims will go up a lot theres quite a bit of time to go
7696539 wij willen er alles aan beerens naar nec te halen
7696540 dat zal alleen niet gaan zonder de hulp van onze sponsors daarom proberen we nu mensen te mobiliseren om het geld op tafel te krijgen
7696541 als ook klose van werder bremen overkomt voel ik er weinig voor bij bayern te blijven
7696542 in principe schuw ik die concurrentie niet maar je weet hoe dat gaat als een club als bayern zich voor vele miljoenen versterkt met twee topaankopen
7696543 die moeten speeltijd krijgen zo werkt dat ik pas ervoor mijn laatste contractjaar bij bayern grotendeels op de bank door te brengen en zo mijn geld te verdienen ik heb de afgelopen vier seizoenen een hoofdrol gespeeld bij bayern en wil niet opeens genoegen nemen met de kans op een bijrolletje
7696544 ik zie niets in een transfer naar een franse of turkse club olympique lyon en fenerbah e hebben contact gezocht maar dat zie ik niet zitten
7696545 het verbaast mij niks dat er nog geen akkoord is
7696546 als een club aangeeft dat een speler niet meer dan een reserve is dan verwacht je dat de clubs er toch snel uit kunnen zijn verder wil ik er op dit moment niets over zeggen
7696547 i started thinking as i was coming over here why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university why is it that my wife is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because their fathers and mothers were not bright is it because hes the first biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree that hes was smarter than the rest
7696548 game spotting meeting local tribes relaxing on beaches and adrenaline sports
7696549 we go up then down then up again for a while and then we are at camp
7696550 anything that is complex is not useful and anything that is useful is simple this has been my whole lifes motto
7696551 if the incident had been reversed and it had been an atheist that had physically assaulted a theist for postering for a theist event that would easily be considered a hate crime and it frequently is this is the exact reverse scenario
7696552 they are treating it not as a hate crime but as a dispute that arose and led to an altercation
7696553 we dont have anything that suggests that as far as im aware of i know mr trottier was talking about that but certainly from what i see it doesnt look like it falls within what our policies and procedures define as a hate crime
7696554 but were still looking at that as well to cover all the bases
7696555 the first individual smacked me in the face twice and said
7696556 atheists have never been accorded the same respect as those with religious beliefs even though our position originates in logic and reason not myth and superstition this escalation of a systemic although till now hidden discrimination is very troubling
7696557 i think i discovered the hard way the boundaries of freedom of speech
7696558 the fact that an atheist should fear for his well being while advertising for a university event that seeks to promote free inquiry is alarming and though i feared for my life briefly ive never felt as strong about my atheism my colleagues and i have only strengthened our resolve to forge ahead with our agenda to push for secularism science and freedom of thought
7696559 you can turn me over i am done on this side
7696560 love your enemies do good to those who hate and persecute you
7696561 if a man slaps you on one cheek offer the other as well
7696562 if a man should take your shoes offer him your coat as well
7696563 son apparently you dont understand the seriousness of this situation
7696564 while i hate galaxy girl was originally kat cahills runner up for our who wants to create a super heroine contest shadowline editor kris simon and i loved the concept so much we had to put it on the fast track to becoming its own series
7696565 when kat saw seths upcoming work on brat halla she knew he was the perfect artist to capture the mood she was going for we really cant help but agree
7696566 the core of i hate galaxy girl is renee finding the self confidence to achieve her dreams despite constantly being told to give up the experience is something i think just about anybody can relate to while the overall story is still a heck of a lot of fun
7696567 what if it was possible for us to render a car so realistically so photo realistically that you cant tell the difference between a real one and a clay model
7696568 9 11 was an inside job our so called election system is completely rigged both parties are corrupt the corporate news media are a joke and a fraud and both white house occupant bush and nearly every member of congress are traitors to america
7696569 9 11 was an inside job our so called election system is completely rigged both parties are corrupt the corporate news media are a joke and a fraud and both white house occupant bush and nearly every member of congress are traitors to america
7696570 9 11 was an inside job our so called election system is completely rigged both parties are corrupt the corporate news media are a joke and a fraud and both white house occupant bush and nearly every member of congress are traitors to america
7696571 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7696572 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7696573 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes

7696588 the television and dvd will find many uses including playing training videos for our volunteers and community safety information at public events as well as enabling us to better monitor the media during operations
7696589 after extensive research the j41 was the obvious choice for our company due to passenger comfort proven reliability and fantastic fuel efficiency
7696590 its not a formal role and does not have any strict requirements all we ask is that ambassadors be positive about the region and proud of its achievements we encourage local companies to support businesses supporting their region
7696591 if we can arm the businesses of the hunter with a positive message to take to their customers here and outside the region we will have a united front in promoting ourselves
7696592 when barack obama announced his candidacy for president from the steps of the old state capitol he described springfield as the crucible where he learned the art of politics and bridging division
7696593 it was here in springfield where i saw all that is america converge he told a crowd of thousands that frigid february day in 2007
7696594 one has to wonder today what springfield obama was talking about
7696595 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7696596 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7696597 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7696598 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7696599 you lost get over it you lost get over it

7696614 all the hard work of the past four years is worth it
7696615 i will remember this for the rest of my life being at the venue meeting other athletes
7696616 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7696617 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7696618 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7696619 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7696620 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7696621 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
7696622 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
7696623 look how long it takes the police or anybody else to get here
7696624 if someone wants to come here and harm someone at least we would have sort of defence
7696625 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
7696626 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
7696627 the big boost to infrastructure announced today reflects last years strong economic performance

7696630 of the 11 deaths in ontario six have been characterized as where the listeria bacteria has been an underlying or contributing factor in the death
7696631 five are still under investigation in terms of determining the extent of the contribution of the bacteria to the death of the individuals
7696632 the one in b c is still a little bit controversial but listeriosis contributed to the death
7696633 all the suspect cases have been diagnosed with listeriosis but it is only via laboratory testing the genetic fingerprinting that we can determine if they are directly linked
7696634 that would be an investigation by the public health agency of canada and the local health units they do the food history so they would make the linkages
7696635 in terms of prevention their advice to pregnant women is lousy
7696636 maybe they should put a warning label on the back of the package

7696880 the hardest part for me was realizing i sign in before you can post messages
7696881 je zit hier anoniem en zon vreemde naam is t nou ook weer niet
7696882 would gilbert keith chesterton support this cause for which im about to invoke his name into
7696883 show the desperate level al qaida has reached with members of one family driving each other to death
7696884 one of the things were really concerned about is how many people are getting hoodwinked by this whole drill now drill here pay less nonsense
7696885 the idea that youre going to use american oil to solve americas energy crisis multi national energy corporations drilling that oil and selling it to foreign markets theres a danger were going to throw away americas beauty and throw those coastline communities under the bus
7696886 there is a solution a green energy solution is right on price its right for the people its right for the planet theyre wrong on price you cannot drill and burn your way out of this you
7696887 expanding renewable supply means you have more solar more wind geothermal more clean energy that also will bring prices down its pure adam smith you know its nothing radical its adam smith so thats right for the price of energy but its also right for the people there are a lot more jobs putting up solar panels and building wind farms than there are in coal mines ill tell you that its right for the planet as well by bringing down carbon emissions when they say drill here drill now pay less we say thats happy meal politics its complete fantasy we say cut demand expand supply and create green collar jobs
7696888 this book is written for those who cannot for their life take modern western culture at face value
7696889 survives and flourishes to the extent that its values are taken to be natural and self evident
7696890 not a liberating new epoch but the working out of a certain decadence that had been predicted for many years even centuries
7696891 the marketing of public depravity among the many for the sake of the private wealth of the few
7696892 for those who suspect that this modern western world even with its wealth and productivity lacks something essential to the human spirit
7696893 too many people are refugees in their own land some outwardly wandering from place to place some inwardly they are displaced people wanderers who do not really know what to call home
7696894 experience of community is one that is much discussed because there is a deep hunger for it but it is this very thing that is so elusive
7696895 families naturally impose a hierarchy of moral judgments based upon the interdependence of generations and the availability of experience
7696896 the ordinary citizen with a sense of impotence in a world barren of meaningful social groups
7696897 social bodies with influence were now less like families and more like armies
7696898 one would think that the modern state is about peace
7696899 but from its actions one can be certain it is organized for war
7696900 to answer some basic questions for those who would like to know if their senses have failed them or if in fact something significant is palpably missing from life in the midst of such a world
7696901 when she has not herself succumbed to the prevailing anti culture of late modernity
7696902 is there a reason that the community with the most far reaching common vision an ecumenical vision began with a man who claimed nothing for himself but answered to a call that ultimately meant his death
7696903 the meaning of the religious experience of vocation in terms of a christian theology of vocation
7696904 for it is precisely choice when it is the first word in our ethical vocabulary that pulls us apart and likewise vocation calls us together
7696905 discourse about god for the sake of life in community
7696906 discourse about society for the sake of life with god
7696907 what one believes about god shapes the way one lives with others in community and what one knows of society if you indeed believe in god cannot be complete if it does not take into consideration the enormous fact of god
7696908 explore the relation between christian theology and the natural sciences using philosophy and history as dialogue partners xi
7696909 having to do with knowledge of nature or the universe
7696910 taking something for granted or accepted as true without proof a supposition
7696911 one of the more significant intellectual conversations of the twenty first century
7696912 best carried out in dialogue with the great tradition of christian theology and in response to the challenges to the christian faith which are raised by other disciplines such as the natural sciences xix
7696913 it goes without saying that this book is in no way an exercise of the magisterium but is solely an expression of my personal search for the face of the lord cf ps 27 8 everyone is free then to contradict me i would only ask my readers for that initial goodwill without which there can be no understanding
7696914 one who brought god to man the god with whom as son he was one xi
7696915 the real object of faith the figure gestalt of jesus became increasingly obscured and blurred xii
7696916 much more like photographs of their authors and the ideas they hold xii
7696917 the impression that we have very little certain knowledge of jesus and only in later stage of faith did his divinity shape image we have of him
7696918 penetrated deeply into the minds of the christian people at large
7696919 a dramatic situation for faith because its point of reference is being placed in doubt intimate friendship with jesus on which everything depends is in danger of clutching at thin air xii
7696920 the very essence of biblical faith to be about real historical events xv
7696921 does not exhaust the interpretive task for someone who sees the biblical writings as a single group of holy scripture inspired by god xvi
7696922 for someone who considers himself directly addressed by the bible today the methods first limit
7696923 is that by its very nature it has to leave the biblical word in the past it is a historical method xvi
7696924 because it is a historical method it presupposes the uniformity of the context within which the events of history unfold it must therefore treat the biblical words it investigates as human words
7696925 intuit something of the deeper value the word contains xvi xvii
7696926 that the inner nature of the method points beyond itself and contains within itself an openness to complementary methods in these words from the past we can discern the question concerning their meaning for today a voice greater than mans echoes in scriptures human words the individual writings schrifte of the bible point somehow to the living process that shapes the one scripture schrift xviii
7696927 not simply imposed from the outside on what is in itself a heterogeneous ensemble of writings xviii
7696928 evolving in continuity with their original sense tacitly corrected and given added depth and breadth of meaning xviii xix
7696929 a process in which the word gradually unfolds its inner potentialities already somehow present like seeds but needing the challenge of new situations new experiences and new sufferings in order to open up xviii xix
7696930 you can see that the old and new testaments belong together xix
7696931 jesus christ as the key to the whole and learns from him how to understand the bible as a unity xix
7696932 it cannot be the conclusion of a purely historical method but this act of faith is based upon reason historical reason and so makes it possible to see the internal unity of scripture by the same token it enables us to understand anew the individual elements that have shaped it without robbing them of their historical originality xix
7696933 presupposes historical critical exegesis and makes use of its findings
7696934 but it seeks to transcend this method and to arrive at a genuinely theological interpretation of the scriptural texts
7696935 deeper value which pertains most of all to words that have matured in the course of faith history xx
7696936 the author does not speak as a private self contained subject but in a living community in a living historical movement not created by him nor even by the collective but which is lead forward by a greater power that is at work xx
7696937 from the perspective of a common history that sustains him and that already implicitly contains possibilities of its future
7696938 the people of god from within whose heart and to whom they speak xxi
7696939 this people does not exist alone rather it knows that it is led and spoken to by god himself who through men and their humanity is at the deepest level the one speaking xxi
7696940 really did explode all existing categories and can only be understood in light of the mystery of god xxii xxiii
7696941 solely an expression of my personal search for the face of the lord xxiii
7696942 because it struck me as the most urgent priority to present the figure and the message of jesus in his public ministry and so to help foster the growth of a living relationship with him xxiv
7696943 exactly much like the game itself it could easily have been produced in the late 1980s
7696944 there are so many books that hit the shelves these days that covers just start to blend together into one big mottled wallpaper so it was a mild surprise when i encountered the stark black and minimalist cover designs

7696951 the results were like muslims some were good some were shiite
7696952 no one could quite believe their ears when he came out with his shiite joke
7696953 he had a very responsible job in a multinational company what on earth was he thinking of
7696954 there were a few embarrassed guffaws but everyone except him knew he was for the high jump the moment he said it
7696955 once word got round and a complaint was made he was toast
7696956 howells jumped before he was pushed part of the deal was that the circumstances of his departure must never be discussed
7696957 but there was no chance of that once his shiite joke started doing the rounds
7696958 we dont comment on individual cases and it is as simple as that
7696959 but everybody at barclaycard gets diversity training and that forms part of our employment contracts
7696960 we do not have a policy of discriminating against anyone who works for us or who wants to be a client and muslims are very much welcome to use our financial services
7696961 he just said the wrong thing at the wrong time in the wrong place
7696962 hes worked all over the world including germany italy and south africa he wouldnt have done that if he was racist
7696963 we ran a real strong grassroots campaign for a year and a half with no money most local campaigns would love to run a campaign like we did
7696964 with the explosion of the mac audience studios no longer have the luxury of releasing new
7696965 where the problem has been is that the existing click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank dvd authoring
7696966 i dont think its a good thing to have both your president and vice president between them have 11 homes at a time when were in a housing crisis
7696967 soul will be located in the old perch space right above lotus on central avenue
7696968 its gonna be a lounge im also gonna do light food there i love food and i love music and i think its perfect to integrate these two together to where theyre on equal playing fields
7696969 i want people to relax and chill and listen to the music
7696970 and if you wanna dance dance if you wanna get a bite to eat then eat but people need to be there and hang around and feel comfortable thats what im working on now hopefully its gonna be the house music mecca its all interactive the dj will be playing all throughout dining hours and everything i wanted a place where everything was happening all at once music and food youre having dinner whats wrong with listening to some good music hopefully thatll be a place a where some of the new guys can play and every now and again i can bring some of the bigger guys to come play i want it to inspire and motivate others
7696971 i think its important for california to realize that we have two eastern senators on one ticket and then you have senator mccain who is often referred to as californias third senator
7696972 we democrats like to think that voters vote on issues
7696973 republicans are better at reaching out to peoples emotions and theyre not confined by the truth
7696974 barack obama wants to change the tax code with proposed tax increases for people making 42 000 a year
7696975 and more importantly he restores taxes on high income corporations just as they existed at the end of the clinton administration thats critically important because it allows for funds to be available for basic programs
7696976 mr smith never tells you that decisions about furniture were a small part of a big thing that had to get done
7696977 those decisions were made by a bipartisan commission and for mr smith to blame jeff merkley is another example of republicans playing loose with the truth
7696978 this convention is going to be so well orchestrated and put together that obama is going to come out with a big bump in the polls
7696979 the us is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
7696980 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
7696981 the us is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
7696982 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
7696983 in the process of trading up and down dramatically last week it has become clear that only one factor really matters right now
7696984 big money investors have turned oil into a proxy for the u s dollar
7696985 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7696986 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7696987 im so proud and excited for him i havent gotten a call from them yet but he does have my support
7696988 if you rode a bicycle youd be home by now
7696989 il ministro gelmini dovrebbe scusarsi con gli insegnanti meridionali per le accuse denigratorie e per la sua scarsa conoscenza del territorio
7696990 probabilmente alla gelmini mancato un adeguato corso di formazione per svolgere il ruolo di ministro il governo berlusconi prosegue russo fino ad oggi ha mortificato la categoria degli insegnanti e lo dimostra la legge 133 appena approvata in parlamento che prevede il taglio di 85mila posti quasi tutti nel meridione anche in questo caso sottolinea russo la gelmini con il suo silenzio e la sua complicit ha denigrato gli insegnanti come se dietro quei posti non ci fossero professionalit ma semplicemente numeri
7696991 everything the organizing the venues the environment in beijing all went so smooth no trouble no problem weve been enjoying it
7696992 sports in china is good the country is very progressive and weve seen more technologies in this olympics were happy that russia is third on the gold medal chart but china did better
7696993 it is a spectacular feat by china i hope india can do the same one day
7696994 the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony were really good introductions to chinese history and i hope they gave everybody a better understanding of how much pride the chinese people have for their country and history
7696995 it was so spectacular and i think everybody was impressed by what they saw
7696996 i think the americans now talk a lot about how really good the chinese audiences have been especially when the americans were part of the competition
7696997 as a chinese i am so proud that we have achieved so much in the olympic games
7696998 los nicos controles que tienen sentido son los que se hacen fuera de competici n en los entrenamientos ahora muy pocos se van a arriesgar a tomar algo
7696999 sono qui questa notte dir caroline kennedy sulla base di antipazioni del suo intervento per onorare due uomini che hanno cambiato la mia vita e hanno cambiato il nostro paese barack obama e edward kennedy
7697000 theres been some studies apparently by previous governments of this i havent seen them which have said it may not work
7697001 but we want to have another look at it because its a positive constructive idea
7697002 the more money you bring into sport the more you can expand it and raise standards
7697003 in an age when higher education is threatened with a relentless technology that threatens to dispense with human beings altogether professor van doren exemplified a tradition of inquiry that celebrates personal interaction as the path to a meaningful education one shaped by spontaneity emotion and yes reverence
7697004 devin is a proven nba player and hell help strengthen our backcourt with his ability to play both the shooting guard and the small forward positions
7697005 he knows our system and we are glad that he is back as a hornet
7697006 the team is filled with great talent and playing with a point guard like chris paul is a joy i am excited to be in new orleans i have a lot of family in the city so it has always been a second home to me
7697007 i dont really see how you could change the building its two storey the walls actually support the top and the bottom storeys cr allgood said
7697008 the council of the day decided in their wisdom to consider those 55 submissions but to actually put the police station up where the court house is cr allgood said
7697009 after talking to the designers we realise how important it is to have the police station and the court house very close to each other
7697010 obviously the police presence on that site is of heritage value because theyve been there for a long time but not in the building that exists there at the moment cr marshall said
7697011 heritage place to me is the precinct that has been used for police use for a number of years and not necessarily the existing police building which hasnt been there for a long time
7697012 admittedly it was built at the same time as the russell street building but russell streets long gone without any objections from around melbourne cr mckenzie said
7697013 now accepting although disappointed of the situation that the facility would not functionally operate on the site at alexandra oval
7697014 we wrote to council to inform them we didnt feel all options had been fully explored at alexandra oval mr cronin said
7697015 were comfortable now that both options have been explored to a balanced extent mr cronin said
7697016 while weve come up with different opinions weve still worked very effectively together and were looking forward to that continuing mr cronin said
7697017 well still be working to bring as many other sporting activities to the area as possible mr cronin said
7697018 last year we held the service in beaufort and next year it will be in stawell
7697019 the great response we had to last years sustainable living expo proved there is a strong interest in sustainability and in learning more about reducing our impact upon the environment mr scherger said
7697020 well have all the latest information and resources available to set out exactly whats available right now to help households become cleaner and greener
7697021 the expo is free for exhibitors and visitors with a free door prize and other giveaways mr scherger said
7697022 estou profundamente preocupado pela solicita o do presidente dmitry medvedev para que o conselho da federa o russa e a duma as c maras alta e baixa do parlamento da r ssia reconhe am as regi es da abkhazia e da oss tia do sul como pa ses independentes
7697023 we have our planning cap on and the adequacy of a facility that is not owned by council is not our concern cr hooper said
7697024 i cannot see how a brand new building full of glass and stainless steel sitting in between the old post office and the court house is in keeping within context of that precinct cr hooper said
7697025 to me they are in conflict and fulfilling my statutory obligations as a councillor and putting my planning hat on i cannot see how i can support it under the act and fulfil my responsibility
7697026 if we were in ballarat or significant places in melbourne that facade would be hung onto and i dont see why we should lower our expectations of a developer cr hooper said
7697027 i think what weve got is something a little bit different and i would like the developer to go back and have a think about the design
7697028 all of the other buildings can be knocked down theyre of no significance and all of the consultants agree with that
7697029 iluminar o que o entregador de leite mais famoso de fountainbridge pensa de muitos aspectos da cultura escocesa e da vida do esporte da arquitetura e claro da tend ncia g tica na literatura da esc cia
7697030 a recep o ser uma oportunidade para a senadora clinton ver seus delegados muitos deles pela primeira vez desde o fim das prim rias agradecer a eles pelo apoio e pelo trabalho rduo e mais importante ainda os incentivar a apoiar e trabalhar pelo senador obama com a mesma intensidade que fizeram por ela para que ele seja eleito em novembro

7697038 estou absolutamente convencido de que tanto hillary clinton quanto bill cinton ex presidente e marido dela entendem o que est em jogo
7697039 e afinal ap s tudo o que aconteceu nesses ltimos 19 meses o barack obama que eu conhe o hoje o mesmo homem pelo qual me apaixonei h 19 anos

7697044 it was such a strange and random thing but so simple when lesean mccoy sweated on an athletic department trainer who had recently been diagnosed with 3 spots of skin cancer miraculously the condition improved we collected 3 more vials and treated other patients with 100 remission this is the biggest medical breakthrough since we discovered that masturbation does not in fact create blindness
7697045 were certainly exploring all options with lesean under current study is that his flatulence completely eliminates rosacea and irritable wlat syndrome iws
7697046 those three factors are really what impacted our result chief executive john mulcahy said
7697047 but we would expect the volatility of the markets to stabilise mr mulcahy said
7697048 we wouldnt expect credit spreads for instance to widen significantly from here
7697049 we would think over time they would contract to some extent
7697050 were not a price setter we usually follow so well follow appropriately mr mulcahy said
7697051 were very comfortable at the moment with the underlying securities mr skilton said of the exposures
7697052 its not to say were not watching them very closely
7697053 thats still a good performance in a deteriorating economic environment mr mulcahy said
7697054 we wouldnt comment on market rumour but were quite confident that our business is performing strongly

7697058 its well known that when you drink you get a buzz but a couple of hours later that initial impact at least is gone
7697059 there is always a very delicate balance between newly formed cells and dying cells
7697060 its a very active period of that balance because usually you develop a surplus of tissue then later melt it back down to acquire a specific shape
7697061 the digits form because the inter digital tissue dies if it did not die we would have paddles instead of hands with fingers
7697062 you have to make people aware of the science behind the risk
7697063 we are not saying that every pregnant woman who drinks three or four glasses of wine in a short period will have a baby with birth defects but it elevates the risk
7697064 ya allah jika anwar ibrahim ini satu manusia yang tulus satu manusia yang betul betul jujur dalam apa yang diperjuangkan jikalau dia ini satu manusia yang betul betul mahu akan kebenaran maka ya allah kau permudahkan lah usaha manusia ini dan berkatilah usaha beliau tetapi ya allah jika manusia bernama anwar ini betul betul pembohong betul betul suka bontot lelaki betul betul tukang liwat atau seorang yang mempermain mainkan sentiment rakyat dan memutar belitkan kepala otak rakyat demi kepentingan dia untuk jadi pm maka ya allah kau letakkanlah segala bala dan petaka kepada manusia bernama anwar ini dan keluarga beliau dan kau laknatlah manusia ini
7697065 whoever wins the majority of these people in the end wins the election
7697066 ive known that accountability matters ive never actually encountered results of accountability versus change until right now
7697067 most of the people here are independents they reject ideology and they reject partisanship and so accountability becomes important
7697068 im sick of the entitlement mentality of them the politicians
7697069 this is our first real voyage into the convention scene
7697070 its an extraordinary confluence of decision makers would be decision makers and the media we feel that its a place that we should be
7697071 whats different this year is that for both parties technology is at the forefront of the election
7697072 the democratic party is clearly the most tech savvy party
7697073 it is a success from the point of view of safety i guess you could say that
7697074 has put a lot of emphasis on winning the west as part of the 50 state strategy
7697075 its sometimes a little lonely being a democrat in utah but were starting to see like some of our surrounding states where people are looking for a change and seeing that democrats can win even in the red states
7697076 were very privileged in the state of montana to have gov brian schweitzer speaking tuesday evening
7697077 we have a different view about guns than people in new york city or inner city d c or inner city chicago
7697078 i know him quite well i wouldnt vote for him but i definitely would go out to lunch and have a good time with him
7697079 take the energy bring it back and let people realize that its important to have a two party system
7697080 a survey of royal society fellows found that only 3 3 per cent believed in god at a time when 68 5 per cent of the general uk population described themselves as believers
7697081 poll in 90s found only seven per cent of members of american national academy of sciences believed in god
7697082 why should fewer academics believe in god than the general population
7697083 deal with very complex issues of religious and cultural pluralism
7697084 tinge of western cultural imperialism as well as an anti religious sentiment
7697085 a football field of land washes away every 50 minutes
7697086 we see a problem and try to fix it and let the music be the voice of the people
7697087 we arent just going to concentrate our means on four or five sports to bring home the medals like the british have done
7697088 80 of the french medallists will still be up for selection in 2012
7697089 in london there will be european chauvinism judge corruption buying of brawn and brains and a strong dose of racism

7697094 we have people who see lake michigan and say wheres the other side you cant comprehend 90 miles across if you havent seen it
7697095 they want productions to come into their town and they are going to do backflips to try to make it work we hear that all the time from producers everyone seems happy to have crews here even though we are shutting down their roads and shooting at 2 a m

7697320 this idea of content sharing is not about cutting back what we do it is about sharing our content with the other large ohio newspapers and getting their content in return
7697321 the goal is to have stories that benefit the readers of all of our newspapers a secondary benefit is that readers will know how much is produced by our newsrooms
7697322 empower newspapers to set up their own member to member sharing of content via ap exchange a highly versatile and robust platform
7697323 wed all like to be able to be out there but given the reality of the costs and other priorities it just isnt realistic

7697330 author abraham zaleznik uses the isaiah berlin parable of hedgehogs and foxes hedgehogs know one big thing while foxes know many things
7697331 our products work across a wide range of vertical segments but for us its the size and structure of a business that makes a huge amount of difference
7697332 its things like whether they have specialised staff or is the business owner doing everything do they have section managers or a payroll person every business is different but those things tell us a huge amount about the types of solutions we need to take to them
7697333 you need a better quality of skill in b2b sales
7697334 they need to know how to think not just what to think so they can engage in a meaningful dialogue about the future of a business just flogging a product wont get you very far
7697335 we tell our sales staff that they have two ears and one mouth and they should be used in those proportions you may have an opinion on the product and what it can do but it is irrelevant it is the clients opinion that counts
7697336 one of the key things we and others do is to understand your market and have a very clear value proposition ideally per client we have all been guilty of coming up with a generic statement to market hoping to gain traction but it wont get that if its not specific so per client has to be the goal
7697337 one to one marketing is the ideal it will usually be impossible to do that but to get as close as possible you need to craft a value proposition around solid information about the company and then have sales staff tailor it further to a particular client
7697338 we know the big corporates are focused on compliance so for them our approach is all about peace of mind and credibility on statutory compliance for the independent contractors administrative convenience is the issue and so for them the message is structured very differently
7697339 the issue with consumers occurs when a business calls them about something theyre not interested in and its the same in the business market if a call or email is irrelevant
7697340 you need to do your research and understand what clients issues are and the outcomes they are trying to achieve if you make a call and help them address that need they are not going to get annoyed and you will be able to progress
7697341 we dont want to try and educate the market about what we do because it is cost prohibitive to do so so we focus on those who hit the website because we have a specialised product they are almost pre qualified if they have come by search to our website so for us it is a matter of ensuring we present a compelling argument to them
7697342 the web is incredibly important but i see so many business that have a very dull website that is essentially just a brochure in electronic form
7697343 it is such a critical thing that you need to make sure it is properly designed and provides rich and changing content to visitors it is not something you can set and forget
7697344 our survey doesnt talk about our products at all but we think it helps us build a brand by associating us with the qualities we want to place on our products
7697345 it is a most effective channel to market because you get broad exposure for next to nothing
7697346 there is an awful lot of fatigue in corporate land in terms of being sold to theyve seen the sell a thousand times before but if you can send information to a decision maker that is relevant informative and helps them carry out their work better theyll accept it
7697347 it is cost effective because it is one to many great for marketing to small business because they tend to see it as less threatening than a sales person coming to their office and best of all it is a great way to directly engage with people
7697348 webinars are great because you cut down the cost of travel and they are a time efficient way for you to touch base with your clients you can get 10 people together in the three minutes it takes them to log in
7697349 recommenders and influencers are incredibly powerful but it takes a long time the accountants that recommend our product are a big part of our strategy but it took 5 or 10 years to earn the confidence of that channel
7697350 we just dont think advertising is a very effective way of getting to a business audience we would rather do things like talk at a workplace relations conference or bring out a white paper even if we were to advertise in an industry magazine people will see it and probably not give it a second glance and they know its been paid for
7697351 unless youve got a huge budget and youre going to do a concerted campaign to get traction youd get far more value spending the 100 000 on a sales person
7697352 i think they both play critical roles we need all of our mayors to be urgently turning out their vote to the greatest degree possible in our base of support in americas cities
7697353 but we also need governors organizations to be very engaged in the suburbs which i think will be the battleground in this race
7697354 2010 is very critical because its a redistricting year that we go through and governors are going to be looked upon very strategically
7697355 well break all records this year and its helped us to be competitive in states that maybe we havent been competitive before
7697356 its their hope to be able to win back a number of governors races in that year in order to control the drawing of congressional district boundaries
7697357 i wont go to every event im invited to that would be impossible
7697358 in fact you go to a small percentage of the events you are invited to because you have your duties to preside

7697373 this latest crisis in indian kashmir must not be used as a pretext for subjecting the press to more violence and obstruction
7697374 journalists must have all the guarantees they need including permanent passes to be able to work freely despite the curfew we also call on the police authorities to investigate the violence by certain elements that have led to injuries in the ranks of the press if no sanctions are adopted the door will be left open for more abuses finally we call for an end to the censorship of local tv stations which is a clear violation of the right of kashmiris to be informed

7697427 the elements the nepali people overthrew are again issuing challenges to bring down the maoist led government earlier than the first hundred days however they will not succeed
7697428 if attempts are made to oust us from the government we will mobilise the people
7697429 we are not afraid at all even if some elements boast their numbers of seats in the constituent assembly we will prove that we can sustain the government by mobilising the people
7697430 that is why one should not worry about the sustainability of the maoist led government
7697431 the nepali government and people are striving for national stability and economic development and hoped to get support and cooperation from china

7697438 the clintons love this country they love the democratic party and they are going to be active participants in our campaign for the remaining 70 days

7697449 in the course of making this decision i thought long and hard about what i brought and what i did not bring to the mayors office i took into consideration my family the many people that have supported me those that have encouraged me and those that asked me to continue to represent the citizens of this community
7697450 as i consider the positives regarding a second term as mayor i find 28 000 reasons to continue that being said when i consider my family i find many reasons to return to nursing
7697451 given that the position of councillor would allow me to continue to represent people on the westside apply the knowledge that i have gained over the past year and at the same time allow me to return to a part time position at kgh i feel that this would be the best way to balance the needs of my family and those of the 28 000 people on the westside
7697452 i believe that all members of council want to support this request it is certainly a safety issue however i have serious questions and doubts about the applicant and their inability to meet the requests of staff
7697453 we are getting a major piece of infrastructure its going to have long term benefits to the community in terms of safety
7697454 i havent heard that is the case today so unfortunately i cannot support a full road closure which otherwise might have support of the neighbourhood just to get it over with
7697455 if it is the wish of council we are quite prepared to have that manned 24 hours a day to prevent other traffic from using that route
7697456 we have no problem with that it thats your desire

7697471 it was just an eery feeling i got when i saw the man sitting there and the way he was looking at the women in the restaurant as they were going in and out of the restroom and it was just really uncomfortable so when i looked him in the face it just all clicked
7697472 i could sleep in my bed that night because i knew they had the right person

7697499 it really shook him up he and i both essentially went through high school and college fantasizing about christina applegate so at first he was really excited like dude i totally get to see christina applegate nude but i guess the trauma of realizing that he drove a dagger into the collective heart of men everywhere by cutting off the very things that helped him through the rough spots of puberty was just too much for him
7697500 it started out kind of funny actually she was lying there on the table unconscious he was joking around check it out im finally getting to touch kelly bundys boobs but then you could almost see a kind of black cloud of realization drift over him as i handed him the scalpel and he remembered the task at hand when it was all said and done he just stood there for awhile then screamed what have i done and ran out of the room crying
7697501 i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here instead of taking the motorway we took the road up through the brecon beacons i feel at home here

7697509 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7697510 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7697511 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7697512 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7697513 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster
7697514 there would be no chance for mr heim to take control of his fathers money as long as there is no hint or proof for mr heims demise there is no legal basis for german authorities to declare him dead

7697522 of the 11 deaths in ontario six have been characterized as where the listeria bacteria has been an underlying or contributing factor in the death
7697523 five are still under investigation in terms of determining the extent of the contribution of the bacteria to the death of the individuals
7697524 the one in b c is still a little bit controversial but listeriosis contributed to the death
7697525 all the suspect cases have been diagnosed with listeriosis but it is only via laboratory testing the genetic fingerprinting that we can determine if they are directly linked
7697526 that would be an investigation by the public health agency of canada and the local health units they do the food history so they would make the linkages
7697527 in terms of prevention their advice to pregnant women is lousy

7697541 his fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him be patient with me and i will pay you back
7697542 but he refused instead he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt
7697543 then the master called the servant in you wicked servant he said i canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to
7697544 i am not i mean maybe i am its just um are these uh
7697545 as of 9 30 a m august 22nd the number of confirmed data breaches in 2008 stood at 449 the actual number of breaches is most likely higher due to under reporting and the fact that some of the breaches reported which affect multiple businesses are listed as single events
7697546 linda foley itrc founder attributes part of the growth of the itrcs breach list to the ability to access state attorney general notification lists that contain breaches that were not reported via media or other sources

7697566 he has been incredible in his ability to link up and get to the right spots when we need someone to run into space
7697567 you need to be an extremely talented endurance athlete to keep getting into spots that other people cant get to because they are too tired
7697568 when you watch him play a game he runs really hard hes doing a little bit of what shaun hart and nigel lappin used to do

7697581 we have continued to refine our brand proposition with significant investment in price merchandise range and quality during the year
7697582 we continue to make gains in market share with sold increases in key measures such as customer traffic basket size and items sold
7697583 in real growth terms this is an improvement on last year
7697584 i heard some comments the other day about the gap closing but they must looking at different numbers to the ones im looking at mr luscombe said
7697585 the numbers that are available to us see us as the biggest player actually growing ahead of the market place
7697586 the numbers ive been looking at show our competitor growing less than the market
7697587 the mathematics of that means that the gap must be opening

7697590 he thought none of that would happen with our kids
7697591 i dont love you i dont need you i dont want you
7697592 my poor daddy would come out and hed just cry june why are you doing this
7697593 theyd say things like god doesnt want you to suffer like this or god doesnt work that way or god gives you common sense
7697594 and i had ears to hear god was in the pruning process in my life
7697595 june you think things are going to get better but they are not
7697596 ive been thinking i know that i said things to hurt you and you said things to hurt me but if you want to well try to make a go of it
7697597 and it wasnt two weeks before he was calling me darling and telling me he loved me
7697598 i cant believe were having so much fun in our 60s
7697599 i cant believe were having so much fun in our 60s
7697600 and every night hed go to bed and say i really appreciate all you do
7697601 and so was he because it was so precious that we were doing it again
7697602 it was six times larger than it was supposed to be
7697603 i know that you know that everybody is a sinner
7697604 and we need jesus and hes the only way to heaven
7697605 we dont want to miss out on what god has to teach us even during the hard times
7697606 because my mama could go through what she did with daddy
7697607 i knew the lord would also give me the strength to be able to make it through with my husband
7697608 the lord used it to bring me to a personal relationship with him
7697609 to start dealing with my anger and bitterness to bond my husband and me together and basically turn my life 180 degrees
7697610 we dont want to miss out on what god has to teach us even during the hard times
7697611 thank you for hanging in there and showing what real love is
7697612 i would like to thank you for all the good and wonderful years words cant tell you how i really feel our love just grows and grows
7697613 especially during those last seven years lamar and i shared such a deep passionate love relationship
7697614 he was my soul mate my lover my best friend he was the spice of life he kept me laughing
7697615 the days and months immediately following lamars death were especially tough

7697619 he can pull out a fresh run and i thought he could get home and run a place and perhaps win if everything went his way
7697620 he will go up in distance now he is usually only good for the one fresh run so the plan is to step him up to a 1500 metre race at sandown on september 10 but it was a nice first up effort

7697626 along with our partners in nhs 24 and nhs boards across scotland we have sought out new ways of helping people who experience anxiety and depression
7697627 this funding will deliver accessible user friendly cognitive behavioural therapy and put people more in control of their mental health
7697628 the scottish government is committed to improving services for those with anxiety and depression and this funding is a direct expression of that commitment
7697629 we will also be commissioning a full evaluation of this pilot service to determine whether this can be rolled nationally in the future
7697630 around 300 000 people each year in scotland seek help from their gp for symptoms of depression making it the most common mental health condition experienced by people living north of the border
7697631 while medication is frequently prescribed there is a broad awareness that psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy can provide long term benefits to patients
7697632 developments within this type of therapy have shown that computerised or telephony based cbt can be highly effective as part of a wider model of care for those with mild to moderate depression

7697655 how much of what is going on here is real and how much is the result of the moment s at which various things hit us
7697656 el promedio del monto estimado de inversi n bordea la cifra de 200 millones por el tiempo de vigencia del contrato

7697658 mostly its about winners and losers at least in the early phases of climate change
7697659 if youre talking about 1 degree 2 degrees hotter not runaway stuff but what were almost certainly committed to over the next 30 or 40 years there will be countries that get away relatively cost free in that scenario particularly countries in the higher latitudes
7697660 there will be huge falls in the amount of crops that you can grow because there isnt the rain and its too hot
7697661 that will apply particularly to the mediterranean and so not just the north african countries but also the ones on the northern side of the mediterranean
7697662 the ones in the european union like spain and italy and greece and the balkans and turkey are going to be suffering huge losses in their ability to support their populations
7697663 it may mean the collapse in the global trade of food because while some countries still have enough there is still a global food shortage
7697664 if you cant buy food internationally and you cant raise enough at home what do you do you move so refugee pressures huge ones are one of the things that drives these security considerations
7697665 india and pakistan are both nuclear armed countries all of the agriculture in pakistan and all of the agriculture in northern india depend on glacier fed rivers that come off the himalayas from the tibetan plateau those glaciers are melting
7697666 theyre melting according to chinese scientists to 7 per cent a year which means theyre half gone in 10 years
7697667 india has a problem with this pakistan faces an absolutely lethal emergency because pakistan is basically a desert with a braid of rivers running through it
7697668 those rivers all start with one exception in indian controlled territory and theres a complex series of deals between the two countries about who gets to take so much water out of the river those deals break down when theres not that much water in the rivers
7697669 its unthinkable but yet its entirely possible so these are the prices you start to pay if you get this wrong
7697670 some of them actually im afraid weve already got them wrong in the sense that there is going to be some major climate change
7697671 that borders going to be militarised i think theres almost no question about it because the alternative is an inundation of the united states by what will be effectively climate refugees
7697672 they us are concerned actually about losing a lot of land and a lot of crop production within the united states itself
7697673 a lot of floridas basically about six inches above sea level and the mississippi river delta well weve already seen what one hurricane did there plus of course many interventions overseas by the american armed forces as much bigger emergencies occur in much bigger parts of the world
7697674 and its not just the analysts i spent the past year doing a very high speed self education job on climate change but i think i probably talked to most of the senior people in the field in a dozen countries
7697675 theyre scared theyre really frightened things are moving far faster than their models predicted
7697676 you may have the arctic ocean free of ice entirely in five years time in the late summer nobody thought that would happen until about the 2040s even a couple of years ago
7697677 the threshold you dont want to cross ever is 2 degrees celsius hotter than it was at the beginning of the 1990s
7697678 that is a margin we have effectively already used up more than half of it would require pretty miraculous cooperation globally and huge cuts in emissions
7697679 my kids will and i dont think that is going to be a pleasant prospect at all because once you go past 2 degrees and you could get past 2 degrees by the 2040s without too much effort things start getting out of control
7697680 the ocean starts giving back to the atmosphere the carbon dioxide it absorbed that world is a world where crop failures are normal
7697681 where for example australia does not export food any more it is hanging on to what it can still grow to feed its own people but that is about all that it is going to be able to do and many countries cant even do that
7697682 there is a study out from the chinese academy of scientists and then swiftly disappeared again but about two years ago we predicted the maximum damage that would be done to china under foreseeable climate change in the 21st century was 38 per cent cut in food production
7697683 that is only about three fifths of the food they now eat and there will be a lot more of them
7697684 because there is so much uncertainty around the markets financial markets capital markets equity markets people dont really know what to think and when one is confused people dont want to make major decisions
7697685 potentially industrial and retail sectors may correct more than the commercial office sectors which tends to be more resilient the down side tends to be less in those areas
7697686 at the moment it is holding up quite well and that is due to the fact that there is a much bigger domestic market in asia pacific than in previous slowdowns and also because there is much more wealth in asia pacific than historically
7697687 although vietnam has its own set of problems if you look beyond the immediate future it has a huge population it has one of the longest coastlines in asia so again there are opportunities there
7697688 i tried to bunt just to tie the game on the visitors side thats kind of weird
7697689 ive never seen anything like that and hopefully we never see that again especially when you lose a game when you wait this long

7697709 this story makes everyone smile and feel happy when i tell it so why is that i asked myself now focussing on what and why is happiness since meeting you and your work the underdog receiving recognition the unexpected the coincidence all of that
7697710 the things that go wrong often make the best memories
7697711 our trip starts now every part of this trip is part of the fun we dont need to fuss about spending a lot of time in the airport before we get on board or traveling by car once we get to denmark the airport is part of the fun and the car ride will be part of the fun the time spent waiting in line to go on the canal tour is just as important as the canal tour itself

7697722 in our view this data is a strong indicator that performance of the mobile carriers network is affecting the iphone 3g more than the handset itself

7697727 in connection with the incident the intruder was able to get a small number of openssh packages relating only to red hat enterprise linux 4 i386 and x86 64 architectures only and red hat enterprise linux 5 x86 64 architecture only signed
7697728 as a precautionary measure we are releasing an updated version of these packages and have published a list of the tampered packages and how to detect them to reiterate our processes and efforts to date indicate that packages obtained by red hat enterprise linux subscribers via red hat network are not at risk
7697729 while there is no definitive evidence that the fedora key has been compromised because fedora packages are distributed via multiple third party mirrors and repositories we have decided to convert to new fedora signing keys
7697730 this may require affirmative steps from every fedora system owner or administrator
7697731 clearly the original claim was an attempted fraud and appropriately rejected
7697732 those who submitted and certified it should be ashamed of themselves

7697778 i think it is the ability to deliver accurate fluid replacement and keep the dogs warm
7697779 that seems to make the difference between them surviving or dying
7697780 i have been surprised that so many people here think you can give a vomiting dog oral electrolytes when the opposite is required

7697827 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7697828 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7697829 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions

7697923 concerns about credit risks both in the united states andjapan are still strong there are also worries about the globaleconomic outlook
7697924 the period ahead will be difficult as we work through thehard task of the redundancies but we will deal openly andfairly with all concerned and see this through
7697925 this is a far reaching program designed tocomprehensively restructure and reposition the business foryears to come
7697926 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7697927 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7697928 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7697929 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

7697933 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7697934 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7697935 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7697936 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7697937 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7697938 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7697939 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7697940 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7697941 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7697942 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7697943 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7697944 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7697945 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7697946 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7697947 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7697948 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7697949 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7697950 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7697951 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7697952 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7697953 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7697954 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7697955 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7697956 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7697957 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7697958 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7697959 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7697960 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7697961 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7697962 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7697963 i saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals
7697964 our fighters had hopes of winning despite the judges but it was useless they were condemned beforehand
7697965 every discipline every human and material resource that we dedicate to sport
7697966 there will be european chauvinism judge corruption buying of brawn and brains and a strong dose of racism
7697967 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7697968 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7697969 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7697970 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7697971 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7697972 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7697973 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7697974 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7697975 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7697976 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7697977 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7697978 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7697979 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7697980 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7697981 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7697982 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7697983 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7697984 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7697985 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7697986 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7697987 who are open to doing something on the production side
7697988 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7697989 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7697990 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7697991 aku suka dia karena orangnya cuek aku juga jadi cocok
7697992 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7697993 you have to use what you have to get what you want
7697994 if the soviets can win a game using noting but ground and the empire can do the same with the sea ea said the allies rule tha air i will try to play a game that i only use allied air units
7697995 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7697996 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7697997 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7697998 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

7698005 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7698006 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7698007 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7698008 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7698009 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7698010 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7698011 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7698012 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7698013 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7698014 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7698015 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7698016 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7698017 after following miss fffabulous suggestion i bought a pair of citizens of humanity kelly maternity jeans and wore them every single day last week they can be dressed up or down and make you feel pretty hot when youre starting to show and looking frumpy in loose fitting clothes the best part for me is that they are nice and long which makes them work well with boots or wedges and they can be rolled up to wear with flats like all maternity pants i find that they need to be pulled up periodically during the day but i think this should happen less as i get further along im at 12 wks right now thank you miss fffabulous for your recommendation i am really happy with them kate

7698106 the president of the united states has claimed on more than one occasion to be in dialogue with god if he said that he was talking to god through his hairdryer this would precipitate a national emergency i fail to see how the addition of a hairdryer makes the claim more ridiculous or offensive
7698107 it is terrible that we all die and lose everything we love it is doubly terrible that so many human beings suffer needlessly while alive that so much of this suffering can be directly attributed to religion to religious hatreds religious wars religious delusions and religious diversions of scarce resources is what makes atheism a moral and intellectual necessity
7698108 a person who believes that elvis is still alive is very unlikely to get promoted to a position of great power and responsibility in our society neither will a person who believes that the holocaust was a hoax but people who believe equally irrational things about god and the bible are now running our country this is genuinely terrifying

7698146 but they know that in order for hillary to be effective in the future we need a democratic white house and they are ready to lay down whatever they need to move on and fight for that
7698147 were really really passionate about the chance to see the first woman ever in the white house
7698148 know they have to put that aside and keep working for that someday in the future they know that everything they care about as democrats is at stake in this election and they are ready to go to work for it
7698149 i have worked with senator obama i know he is going to be just a great president
7698150 he sits next to me on the veterans affairs committee and he shares my passions and he is a great leader and it was not hard for me to make that decision at all
7698151 when he is in the white house i can pick up the phone and talk about issues that are important to washington state
7698152 plan x or y or whatever we are on now
7698153 thats one of the things about marve hes a tough guy
7698154 of course we felt bad for our teammate i talked to him about it hes handling it great thats the kind of guy marve is hes not going to let this get in his way hes going to come back and hes not going to skip a beat hes going to be firing on all cylinders
7698155 all the guys theyve all handled it real well this is a program thats going to hold guys accountable and they know that theyre still going to get their opportunities the guys that are suspended are going to be there to cheer the other guys on theyre not there to hold any grudges theyre there to support the rest of the guys
7698156 curfew study hall and doing the right things in the classroom
7698157 hes mature he reminds me of a rockstar to be that young i marvel at how well he handles the pressure and how far hes come along in a short amount of time he really doesnt act like a freshman quarterback its been a great transition from high school to now hes taken it so well really taken control of it im proud of him
7698158 marve likes to get out of the pocket and scramble a little bit more jacory likes to stay in the pocket
7698159 if we throw them in for 60 plays and 30 plays they dont know what theyre doing then youll have problems
7698160 we have confidence because we prepared them for the situation
7698161 theyve gotten a lot of reps in scrimmages and what not so i think theyll go into the situation and be ready theyve gotten more work than most freshman have ever here so they wont be as brand new to things
7698162 allen bailey the other day went through the whole entire individual work out and tossed one of the offensive lineman doing drills
7698163 we just got to keep progressing both of them went to the doctor and the doctor said they looked good as long as the doctors say its ok they could play moncur was probably more ahead of bailey but both of them are about equal now
7698164 cook knows the defense like the back of his hand
7698165 when i came in as a freshman he knew the defense like the back of his hand and now he knows this one like that it gives you a lot of confidence when you got a guy in there when you know what to do it gives you a lot of confidence
7698166 the terminology has changed a lot and as we go through the season well pick up on a lot of things
7698167 basically what we have to do is erase everything from the last two years and start all over
7698168 hes graded out real well in all of our scrimmages and practices
7698169 its real surprising when you think hes only been here one year by the way hes playing it looks like hes been here a couple years
7698170 i wouldnt compare him to rochford xavier is really athletic rochford was a guy who would beat you with speed xavier has a little more muscle on him he some speed on him too but he definitely can move people around
7698171 one minute you could be getting ready to punt then a first down comes and you might be in field goal range

7698177 a building of this quality scale and material is a good precedent to set
7698178 any observations besides that this is a giant can of worms
7698179 design review guidelines do trump code i dont think design review guidelines allow a building of 74 feet or even 64 feet to be built in this neighborhood
7698180 i dont spend a lot of time worrying about stuff like that
7698181 we have to remember that whales are descended from a common ancestor of cows so this is not a surprise given what we know about whales
7698182 this is an incredibly neat use of google earth this is a study we would not have dreamed about doing five years ago
7698183 a reflectibilidade de um metal uma fun o muito sutil de sua temperatura

7698185 deeply discounted distressed sales continue to drive volume in many regions of the state in general greater percentage gains occurred in lower priced areas that had been most adversely affected by the market downturn since late 2005 and that are concurrently experiencing the biggest declines in prices
7698186 philosophical beliefs and whats in the best interests of the state
7698187 its very upsetting and frustrating because we get requests for milk every day
7698188 we need a milk bank for babies who cant get their nutritional needs met by their mothers donated milk can prevent serious infection in babies save lives and greatly improve health outcomes
7698189 ive already told you once you cant hand out those balloons its an offence
7698190 this is an unconscionable state of affairs and must be investigated
7698191 if you do not have a person going around checking on what people are doing when they are recording and coding information all evidence suggests there will be errors random systematic and perverse
7698192 its extraordinary that a health minister would not want to investigate this immediately
7698193 it displays ignorance and it says he does not trust the people running our hospitals
7698194 the speed at which the climate is changing has been significantly underestimated with thousands of australian homes potentially at risk from rising sea levels a conference has heard ports harbours and airports situated near the ocean are also vulnerable to the immediate effects of climate change said keynote speaker jo mummery preliminary modelling has found that if there is a rise in sea levels 269 505 houses could be at risk in nsw and 2 875 houses in the nt
7698195 dr jo mummery from the department of climate change told the delegation that if sea levels rose just one metre exclusive pockets of the gold coast would be completely washed out she says if water enters a 200 metre buffer zone almost 559 000 residential buildings would be affected across the country
7698196 the head of the climate change unit at the australian national university and science adviser to the federal government professor will steffen says he believes the scientific community is underestimating the speed at which the climate is changing
7698197 the evidence over the past 12 to 18 months suggests that we have underestimated how fast this aspect of the earths system can change
7698198 yeah mom just keep yelling at me its all going in one ear and right back out the other
7698199 uh dear you know there isnt really any santa claus dont you
7698200 honey you know santa claus is really mommies and daddies right
7698201 honey im sorry i thought you knew havent the other kids in school been telling you there isnt any santa claus
7698202 lets see how we can use this to our advantage
7698203 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen
7698204 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
7698205 the bottom line is we dont have a job if we dont entertain
7698206 in my mind thats as big a part of the job as shooting under par
7698207 we play so good overall when you win you should give your speech in english mostly what comes out is nerves totally different language in front of camera youre excited and not thinking in english
7698208 the lpga could come out and say they only want 10 koreans but theyre not
7698209 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
7698210 this is an american tour it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
7698211 this should be a priority in their professional development just the way working on their short game is a priority
7698212 we just need to get confidence in the camera when cristie kerr won in 2005 at michelob ultra open first thing she said to the camera was i need a beer
7698213 at a difference of 4 6 dbm one might start to wonder if there is anything wrong
7698214 she was one of those players who we immediately trusted and it gave us flexibility swallen said
7698215 a lot of time with young players you have to get them seasoned the game is a little faster game but she was ready to play the first game she scored a goal she was one of the those players we wanted to get the ball to because the right things happen
7698216 it seemed like the seniors were all so much bigger than the freshman she said
7698217 it has gone by so fast it doesnt seem like i should be a senior and i dont seem that much bigger than the freshmen
7698218 she distributes the ball she has great vision swallen said
7698219 if we need her to go forward she will do that she kind of does everything we want her to touch the ball as much as possible being a midfielder allows her to dictate the course of the game
7698220 shes the type of kid who wants to be the best at everything swallen said
7698221 shes that way in the classroom taking all accelerated classes everything she does all day is always high end
7698222 raises an important point of law that could outlive this administration
7698223 arkansas needs to affirm the importance of married mothers and fathers
7698224 we need to publicly affirm the gold standard of rearing children whenever we can the state standard should be as close to that gold standard of married mom and dad homes as possible
7698225 im just going to keep fighting to find a place to live
7698226 fema keeps bailing us out but somehow i always feel like a victim
7698227 you are stuck for so long in a temporary housing situation that you end up running up costs and its not the most efficient way to deliver long term housing needs its bleeding your ability to put your money in longer term needs
7698228 were in this interim phase where were trying to move people out of travel trailers and mobile homes and into rental units that well help pay for
7698229 but the third phase the permanent housing is going to be a challenge
7698230 but so much of it never reached the people who needed it
7698231 it was kind of pathetic to tell you the truth
7698232 there was a concern about the increased cost to carriers we accommodated that by reducing the speed zones
7698233 its disappointing that it cant be all that it could be
7698234 if we didnt lose one or two females a year
7698235 we want the speed to be slow enough so that the whales have a chance to get out of the way or the blow will be a glancing blow and they will survive
7698236 well take our voices with our hands well make like knives well make demands im burning bridges for the last time im breaking habits for the first time i saw my future today it said im going away and i still havent sung the last line on my way down im not ready to lay im not ready to fade im not ready to die
7698237 this shocking incident underscores the terrible dangers and threats that continue to face journalists in somalia
7698238 we call for them to be set free immediately the somali authorities must act urgently to see our colleagues come to no harm
7698239 we are worried about their safety as we have had no contact with anybody saying they are holding the journalists and their driver

7698244 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
7698245 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discreet charm
7698246 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case anymore
7698247 heres my thoughts on this there is a good amount of space in a 5 1 4
7698248 is a virtue thinking outside of practical common sense and reason is dangerous and unrealistic
7698249 wow the new bell canada ads are such a dramatic change from their previous image
7698250 i saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals
7698251 our fighters had hopes of winning despite the judges but it was useless they were condemned beforehand
7698252 every discipline every human and material resource that we dedicate to sport
7698253 there will be european chauvinism judge corruption buying of brawn and brains and a strong dose of racism
7698254 show the desperate level al qaida has reached with members of one family driving each other to death
7698255 i swear to allah that i do not know them they were strangers
7698256 no no they put it on me and told me to take it off at home
7698257 the senior who is ahead of me at left tackle has had a back thats been acting up he hasnt been able to practice much and missed the scrimmage on friday with him hurt ive been playing with the ones first team
7698258 ive got to be ready to play either way lesuma may not be able to play every down
7698259 its a little nerve wracking but im sure im going to be excited when game day comes
7698260 but most importantly this game means a lot to my teammates and i dont want to let those guys down i just want to do well so my team can do well
7698261 we just watched game film sunday and well start putting in a game plan
7698262 but theyre definitely a good team theyre very athletic and good on defense were going to have to execute and be efficient on both sides to get the win i think we have the talent and if we play our best we can win
7698263 im ok now but its definitely been an interesting summer
7698264 to go from being injured to getting better and then getting sick and getting better again and now possibly starting its been a crazy summer its been a hard summer
7698265 its definitely a shift the new coaches have brought in some new philosophies and new expectations
7698266 the thing ive learned the most is that its not so much about the coaching staff as it is the players like i said i dont want to go out saturday and play well for our coaches i dont want to let my teammates down

7698275 we dont think that parade is going to enhance our image as the arts and cultural capital of new zealand
7698276 we dont want to make a big fuss over this event it isnt the type of high quality event we want wellington to be known for
7698277 most of our 1000 or so members would probably be happier if the event did not proceed but if it does we dont want the huge focus on it that was created by the controversy in auckland this year
7698278 we suspect that many auckland businesses likewise dont see the auckland parade doing much for aucklands brand either
7698279 todos los aspectos del conflicto afgano deben respetar escrupulosamente las leyes internacionales incluidos los aspect

7698282 what most people dont seem to realize is that there is just as much money to be made out of the wreckage of a civilization as from the upbuilding of one
7698283 thats not real thats just lip service to former candidates former candidates and party elders thats just a courtesy
7698284 okay whom do you think the best pick for obama would have been
7698285 el que se siga atacando a al cvr como se hace quiere decir que hemos tocado carne y que las conciencias no est n del todo tranquilas hay que leer el informe porque si se hiciera eso no se dir an las tremendas torpezas y estupideces que algunos de los cr ticos pronuncian es de personas muy poco inteligentes el fanatizarse y solo ver un lado del asunto lo que dijo la cvr forma parte de la historia del pa s y no se va a borrar a menos que borremos nuestro pasado nuestras cosas buenas y malas
7698286 les dir luego de haber visitado israel hace mes y medio que su sentir en general es no permitiremos que ir n obtenga un arma nuclear
7698287 mi trabajo como presidente ser a tratar de asegurarme de que estamos apret ndole las tuercas a ir n diplom ticamente hablando que llevamos a la comunidad internacional a actuar contra el programa nuclear de ir n de manera seria tenemos que hacerlo antes de que israel sienta que tiene la espalda contra la pared
7698288 bill clinton sabe algo sobre eso de tratar de mejorar la econom a no tendr a sentido alguno que yo intentara editar sus afirmaciones
7698289 beyond the speeches how much do you really know about barack obama
7698290 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could and the fact that hes launching his own convention by defending his long association with a man who says he didnt bomb enough u s targets tells us more about barack obama than any of tonights speeches will
7698291 sayajalullahu bada usrin yusron alloh kelak akan memberikan kelapangan sesudah kesempitan
7698292 new book out and making the move to open access
7698293 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
7698294 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
7698295 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
7698296 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
7698297 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
7698298 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
7698299 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
7698300 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
7698301 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
7698302 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
7698303 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
7698304 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
7698305 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
7698306 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
7698307 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
7698308 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
7698309 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
7698310 success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best that you are capable of becoming
7698311 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7698312 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognise these separatist regions
7698313 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7698314 the united states will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7698315 the g7 is united in support for georgias territorial integrity and alarmed by reports of russian plans to recognise abkhazia and south ossetia
7698316 that decision is not going to help things it only adds to the tension in the region
7698317 we will take any decision including up to a complete break in relations
7698318 there has been a dramatic worsening of our relations but we are not to blame
7698319 a wide range of initiatives will result in a head count reduction of approximately 550 employees in australia and new zealand or approximately five percent of the companys full time workforce
7698320 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile
7698321 this far reaching programme will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7698322 over the course of the 2006 and 2007 financial years we achieved a52 million in ongoing real cost reductions
7698323 cost synergies associated with the merger of fairfax media and rural press and the acquisition of southern cross radio produced a further a53 million in savings
7698324 all of these synergies will be realised by the end of this financial year
7698325 the survey results would suggest that anwar will not lose but he may not do exceptionally well either
7698326 we have had a spate of window etching in the lincoln rd and moorhouse ave areas in the last couple of weeks particularly between august 1 and 4
7698327 i would estimate that the damage in the moorhouse ave lincoln road area in the past few weeks would be in excess of 50 000
7698328 this type of crime is also happening in most other parts of the city and needs to be stopped
7698329 these findings suggest that lung cancers interact with circulating white blood cells and change the types of genes that are active in these cells
7698330 we found that the types of genes present in these cells could tell us whether or not cancer was present
7698331 ct screening results in the detection of lung nodules in 20 to 60 percent of subjects
7698332 this high false positive rate requires patients to undergo extensive follow up investigations such as serial ct scans pet scans or biopsies this test may be able to obviate the need for such things if it is developed into a large scale diagnostic tool
7698333 if our results are encouraging we would like to test this in a prospective clinical trial
7698334 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
7698335 theyre going all of these routes through threats intimation to try to thwart the here because they dont have an argument on merit
7698336 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
7698337 your station is committed to operating in the public interest an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity
7698338 with all our problems why is talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7698339 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7698340 i hate the feeling that you shouldnt wear your hillary gear unless there are two or three of you together
7698341 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7698342 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7698343 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7698344 i cant imagine not going into a convention and hearing alabama and the whole world looking up to see what comes next
7698345 but as typical of these roll calls at a certain point somebody has the votes and the protocol and graciousness come through and that will have its own dynamic
7698346 letzter versuch der besuch eines der wie schwammerln aus dem boden wachsenden in lokale
7698347 and i know he has been supportive of secretary rices state department
7698348 i think secretary rice has made clear who she intends to vote for and that will be and whomever he chooses to join him on the ticket
7698349 im sure theres also a baseball game on tonight too
7698350 although current penetration of the higher education market is only 2 3 percent that still represents a good rate of uptake for such a new pre standard technology
7698351 as video becomes an essential part of the academic experience bandwidth video requirements and newer laptops which increasingly will have 802 11n built in mean that a marriage of convenience will occur between students needs to view video anywhere on campus and the ability of 802 11n enabled laptops to handle the bandwidth requirements
7698352 we finally know what the big faults between wellington and blenheim are doing
7698353 the general discontinuity of active faults across cook strait has important implications for how we interpret the size and location of future earthquakes in the region
7698354 by determining the rate of activity on the faults over many thousands of years we can also estimate the interval of time between earthquakes on each fault
7698355 apesar de alguns nos acharem defensivos demais s jogamos com um volante somos um dos poucos times do brasil a jogar assim

7698357 of course why not if there is a suspension of military cooperation this is military cooperation
7698358 no one with common sense can expect to cooperate with russia in one part of the world while acting against it in another
7698359 by daring to begin the life youve always wanted you become energized
7698360 laughter is a direct route to the soul it broadens your perspective keeps you healthy and makes an unbearable situation easier to deal with
7698361 being paralyzed by indecision is worth than making the wrong decision
7698362 prayer is asking god to transform the situation and become the heart of your life
7698363 hope is the knowledge that even in the worst of times we can triumph over hardship and sorrow and grow in spirit
7698364 we cant always choose our circumstances but we can choose our attitude towards them
7698365 create more wealth than any other single business action known

7698378 people are finding themselves overextended now that the economy is failing
7698379 it stands to reason that if we are seeing this kind of increase in the number of automobile repossessions then there has to be an elevated level of big ticket repossessions
7698380 when people have financial troubles among the first things they stop paying are things like their boats
7698381 ive had more of my customers dispose of their airplanes than before

7698428 we still have students who come in with questions about what types of loans are available to help with increasing prices
7698429 we recommend to students who have been with us multiple years to seek out department rewarded scholarships
7698430 students can check with the different schools and programs on campus to see what rewards are offered for the fall and spring semesters
7698431 we even have an express financial aid advisor this year who can answer quick questions in a matter of minutes
7698432 any little bit i can do to reduce my receipts is worth it
7698433 with costs already rising you have to wonder how high things will be four years from now

7698445 part of the experience of learning to play is learning about the guy we ask who were your influences and why did you write a certain song such as rushs

7698450 sometimes people sabotage the boat if they know youre coming to get it they take fuel they take parts
7698451 i remember years ago when we used to pick up a boat a day
7698452 people that have gotten into boating more recently are not as experienced and may not have realized the costs involved fuel is a big part of it marinas are charging 5 to 6 a gallon and youve got a 300 to 400 gallon tank
7698453 but if i dont take your car someone else will

7698465 well what we found is that online video consumption has grown rapidly in the last 12 months from 11 of europeans users watching some kind of online video in 2006 but then in 2007 that was up to 28 so it really has grown extremely rapidly
7698466 i think thats one of the interesting things weve found is although the consumption has grown rapidly we still tv as by far the most important deliverer of video content into the home
7698467 broadcasters shouldnt be complacent about this this is in some ways a challenge to the authority of tv and in certain among certain user groups young users are increasingly watching content online as well as on tv and some shows like the bbcs mighty boosh at least 40 of its audience watch it by iplayer
7698468 but they know that in order for hillary to be effective in the future we need a democratic white house and they are ready to lay down whatever they need to move on and fight for that
7698469 were really really passionate about the chance to see the first woman ever in the white house
7698470 know they have to put that aside and keep working for that someday in the future they know that everything they care about as democrats is at stake in this election and they are ready to go to work for it
7698471 i have worked with senator obama i know he is going to be just a great president
7698472 he sits next to me on the veterans affairs committee and he shares my passions and he is a great leader and it was not hard for me to make that decision at all
7698473 when he is in the white house i can pick up the phone and talk about issues that are important to washington state
7698474 when i die i want to go peacefully in my sleep like my grandfather not screaming in terror like his passengers

7698482 we know that family is going through a most difficult time
7698483 we want them to know how deeply we feel for them and support them
7698484 we are still hopeful that additional information will eventually surface that will lead us to yi jien
7698485 but we know that the odds for that outcome are reduced with each day that goes by in the absence of a promising development we will be scaling back the operation

7698494 a policeman assigned to guard the archangel michael church in deshasha beni soueif province south of cairo hit three women while they were taking sand into the church to fix the floor which was cracked as result of water collection underneath
7698495 the worrying rise in sectarian tension that we have seen in deshasha is a direct result of violations committed by the police
7698496 this incident must be investigated and those responsible held accountable
7698497 the archangel michael church in deshasha is but one example of the futility of any efforts to reform and unify construction and renovation laws for places of worship so long as security agents continue to violate existing laws in a discriminatory manner and with complete impunity

7698524 to be truly effective a global response is needed but the uk has an opportunity to lead the way
7698525 in the uk alone biofuel subsidies cost 550m annually in 2005 a similar investment in preventing deforestation and peatland destruction could have offset the equivalent of up to 37 of all uk co2 emissions
7698526 in the uk we can dramatically increase funding for forest and peatland projects domestically and with key partners especially in south east asia as well as lobbying at an international level for the right global policies
7698527 all this can be done within our current budget by ending wasteful and damaging biofuel subsidies
7698528 while ministers are calling for the international community to look at the impact of biofuels here in the uk the governments policy means people are filling up their cars with biofuels that may be damaging the environment and endangering food security
7698529 time and again the government has been warned that their policy of targets without safeguards is madness

7698566 this reflects much tougher trading conditions for business and professional firms after a period when business trends had been holding up in the face of the slowing economy
7698567 from what ive seen so far this season it will be the same two at the top of the league again
7698568 arsenal and liverpool have the players to push united and chelsea hard but those two are just too strong at the moment they have too many options
7698569 im sure united will end up with berbatov and that will make a big difference for them it will give them another goal threat and another way of playing
7698570 their movement is something else and made it really difficult for us tonight to get into the game tevez in particular was excellent today a real handful
7698571 we were a decent team last season and will be a good one again this year
7698572 we have a few new players and they just need to learn how to play together but that will come

7698583 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7698584 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7698585 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7698586 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up

7698597 he cocked the gun on the side of my face and i said please dont do this

7698638 but we both play skills positions where you really have to have good hands and i felt we had soft enough hands to do pretty well in the competition
7698639 i got hit with a couple of balloons i got wet receivers chased me around threw a couple of balloons at me it was fun
7698640 it was a good time it got everyone close together i met some new people from different teams so i think it was a pretty good day
7698641 it was very well attended i heard a lot of the teams out their supporting each other i know football was like we need to leave the place better than when we came
7698642 there are things sports embodies and makes visible to us values that extend far beyond sports values of excellence values of working really absurdly hard to develop the highest possible levels of performance values of working in teams values of sucking it up when something goes wrong and getting right back up and doing your best the next time
7698643 hafner is done he will never play well in this league again
7698644 should the govt ban airsoft is airsoft good or bad
7698645 kelly shoppach and ryan garko will likely be the odd men out
7698646 my guess is that sal fasano and andy gonzalez will be the odd men out
7698647 why did the browns fall short of the playoffs last season
7698648 5 is your friend and teammate braylon edwards plotting some sort of revenge after gashing his foot a couple weeks ago nah laughs hes just working to get back he will be fine hes taking care of his foot and he will be ready soon
7698649 hey remember that time you hurt the all pro wr
7698650 get bumped back when you get hit by an enemy based adventure games
7698651 i believe if we began impeachment proceedings we will be engulfed in more of the politics that has made washington dysfunction
7698652 outside her bel air home nancy reagan stood arm in arm with john mccain and offered a significant but less than exuberant endorsement ronnie and i always waited until everything was decided and then we endorsed the republican matriarch said in march well obviously this is the nominee of the party they were the only words she would speak during the five minute photo op
7698653 you cant believe her shes going to try and deceive you into thinking shes not an angry black woman
7698654 heres the woman who thought it was ok for the man responsible for a million deaths based on lies should walk around free
7698655 you say you are a pro choice democrat how can you then support mccain
7698656 heres the woman who thought it was ok for the man responsible for a million deaths based on lies should walk around free
7698657 theres really five companies that control 90 percent of what we read see and hear
7698658 disrespectful of the effort of the game developers who worked on the game and misleads both consumers and game industry peers
7698659 some people claim that providing complete credit information encourages people to leave their job before a game is complete
7698660 these reasons are simple window dressing for policies that are arbitrary unfair and in some cases even vindictive and they simply dont hold up
7698661 the number of people who read a games credits is irrelevant even if only one person reads the credits of a game integrity demands that all work be accurately and honestly represented
7698662 the bottom line from my perspective is the surgery went well
7698663 right now its a rough day for him but everything went well
7698664 he was fixing to be a big part of this team and to go out there on that field and see this kid laying there after what he went through was tough
7698665 we were talking about it this morning you can be out there in one play and it can be over for you just like that
7698666 i talked to cedric the other day and he told me how well hes doing
7698667 were rooting for him and i just cant wait to see him walk through those practice gates
7698668 undoubtedly the entire responsibility for the events in south ossetia lies on the georgian side the georgians have repeatedly tried to expel the ossetians from their traditional homeland such attempts were made in the 19 th century on three separate occasions the georgian government tried to wipe out the inhabitants of south ossetia the first time was when the russian empire collapsed in 1918 at that time some 18 000 ossetians were murdered by georgian troops and 50 000 fled to north ossetia the second time was at when the soviet union disintegrated in 1991 georgia declared its independence and attempted to annex south ossetia an autonomous region under the soviets editors note more than 3 000 people were killed by the georgian forces and 40 000 became refugees during these past few days the georgian government attempted to commit genocide against the south ossetian people for a third time it shocks me to know that the georgian members of the peacekeeping force shot their russian colleagues in the back this is something that i as a decent human being cannot understand i cannot comprehend how normal people can shoot at children women and old people
7698669 the usa wishes to extend its influence in the caucasus through the agency of georgia to have access to oil supplies in the caspian region their strategy is such that they are indifferent to the means used and the fate of the peoples of the region means nothing to them american values are no longer those preached by the founding fathers of american democracy washington jefferson and madison we face another america and we must understand that their desire to bring georgia and the ukraine into nato is only a move to find willing hands to provoke an armed conflict with russia
7698670 yes i can confirm im pregnant its still early so im being cautious im resting as much as possible
7698671 ive moved down to the beach with tito i love being by the beach
7698672 i think im gonna stay unmarried and just go for the babies
7698673 darius has been in twice for workouts with us and has impressed us with his progress health and attitude
7698674 darius will have the next couple of months to prove to myself and coach rivers that he can help us win
7698675 the rise of the indo afghan empire c 1710 1780
7698676 from the black mountain to waziristan by h c wylly
7698677 the pathans themselves left no early contemporary literature they built no monuments and left no inscriptions in their own country therefore the historians must rely on stray and chance material available in the records the literature monuments and coins of the many dynasties and peoples whose path took them to the territories where the afghans now dwell
7698678 the record of these traditions and tribal tables is suggestive
7698679 under this interpretation even the bani israel story may reflect some part of the truth and at least indicate a cause for a belief which however unreasonable it is hard to shake
7698680 it is inconceivable that a conquering race such as the epthalites huns which left proved descendants down in india among the rajputs did not contribute also to the blood of the peoples of gandahara peshawar which was one of their headquarters
7698681 the family tree of ghurghusht qais third son is shorter and less attractive the kakars of zhob loralai and parts of sibi in baluchistan are a very large tribe and they have never been held high in the account whether in war or peace and are less anarchic
7698682 about two thirds of the original utmanzai territory is now occupied by the gaduns who in old days were invited to cross the indus as mercenaries and were given in requital the lands they now hold on the western and southern slopes of mahaban mountain the trans frontier clans contain about 2000 fighting men they do not enlist freely nor are they in request being considered to be of smaller fighting value than other pthans the trans indus gaduns are bounded by the utmanzais by amazais the tribesmen are all cultivators or cattle owners
7698683 the first genuine and historical glimpse of the afghan and pathan peoples in their own country is given to us in the inimitable baburnama the memoirs of babur the first mughal emperor 1482 1530 prior to this the names ghaljis and lodhis was all that was heard in the chronicles
7698684 when we come to babur everything changes suddenly the curtain rises the footlights go up on the afghan scene that up to that moment has been shrouded in darkness
7698685 from the narrative it is likely that the change of plan was due to negotiations between babur and malik shah mansur usafzai negotiations which ended in baburs taking the maliks daughter in marriage
7698686 in other words baburs evidence taken on broad view does not conflict with the suggestion for afghan and pathan origins as set out earlier in this book
7698687 where they had emigrated from the west of indus in the 17th century
7698688 the protection granted to such parasites was not free however and had to be earned
7698689 the hamsayas received territories of their own land and could act as their buffers against outside encroachments
7698690 even the laws of hospitality will go down before the nurtured enmity bequeathed by blood feud
7698691 i believe that tribal movements have been very greatly exaggerated in the tribal traditions in my time i have seen a process of replacement of one tribe by another going peacefully on over a period of generation in the usafzai and mohammadzai territory known as maira in the north of samah
7698692 for some years however the gaduns continued to give trouble committing outrages of all kinds and raiding on the border they were blockaded coerced and fined they were implicated in attacks on malakand and chakdara posts but in the end they finally made submission and paid up the fines demanded of them
7698693 the pathan tribes who boasted they had never within memory yielded even to mughal or durrani had actually suffered defeat in open battle at the hands of unbelievers
7698694 that peshawar contains no architectural monuments of any value is due mainly to the devastation of 1823
7698695 the hatred of the sikh terror which they shared no doubt helped them to sink all jealousies and work together for the common end
7698696 as a people they have always been evilly notorious for their faithlessness lawlessness treachery and brutality so much so that the saying afghan be iman afghan is faithless has passed into a proverb among neighboring peoples and oddly enough is acknowledged by themselves to be a true count not only in their dealings with the stranger but among themselves too
7698697 i was 20 years old in 1847 and i met him more than once and i remember him well i was once in a jirga when he asked us if we would stand and fight with sikhs if he stood by us we swore we would there were tears in our eyes and a tear in abbott sahibs eye too we did he was our father there are no angrez like abbott sahib now we loved him
7698698 among the people of hazara he left a name which will not die
7698699 it is impossible to reflect on the tribal society without mention of nawab abdul qayyum khan
7698700 to look at he was magnificent who held his head splendidly
7698701 among the people of n w f p he will live for ever
7698702 year by year the pathans of n w f p became more conscious of a challenge an uplifting that called them to an expansion of the mind faintly dreamed of but never before realized the eyes of youth turned to wider horizon of ambition and employment he was outgrowing the trammels of tribalism and began to look with contempt on the introversions of kabul under durrani feudal
7698703 afghanistan is largely an ethnic mystery in the absence of written records makes tracing their ethnogenesis almost impossible in recent years scholars have begun to examen the afghan ethnic groups but anthropometric and serological evidence is still scanty and historic sources are fragmentary and inconclusive thus the question of afghans origin has evoked more controversy than consensus
7698704 no part of afghanistan has been subject to more speculative theories or requires more practical elucidation than this mountain region in which so large a share of the drama of afghanistan history has been played
7698705 the mythical character of the whole account is surely clear enough from what has been said even the story of the early conversion of qais and his companions can be disproved we shall see from reliable muslim sources including the traveler al biruni and the courtier al utbi both writing in the time of mahmud of ghazni early in the eleventh century a d these accounts establish that four centuries later than the time of qais the province of kabul had not been islamized and this was only achieved under the ghaznavids the hindu shahiya kingdom of jaipal extended almost to kabul and mahmud had to fight against infidel afghans of the sulaiman mountains even later than this in the great war of a d 1192 between the muslim invaders and the hindu kingdom of northern india the hindu ruler had assembled a force of afghan horsemen and there were afghans fighting on both sides there is thus more than an indication that even at the end of the twelfth century the sixth hijri all afghans had not been converted though the legends represent them as rushing into the fold in the days of khalid
7698706 the theory of jewish origin of pathans though ardently believed in by many pathan intellectuals does not stand a test of a scientific analysis the gap of 1700 years between qais and his ancestor king saul is supposed to have been filled in by 36 generations which does not appeal to reason the whole account of this theory is thus reduced to a legend pure and simple
7698707 israel appears to have blue eyes and among its characteristics red hair but there is no sort of proof of the claim nor its likely that one can ever be forthcoming also the name afghanistan was born in relatively modern times formerly it was known as kabulistan and khorasan
7698708 because they were a tribe of prestige and vigor and because they held some of the best part of what we now call afghanistan and because it was one of their chiefs who founded the afghan power calling it the durrani empire all the muslim tribes other than the turkish origin claim to be offshoots of the same race the story of the afghan tribes those who call themselves the ben i israel has been told and how many have tacked themselves on to a bogus genealogy because it was fashionable thing to do cis indus is the tract once famous as the black mountain and the scene of many expeditions to prevent its tribes raiding into the peaceful districts of hazara here the bulk of the clans all belong to the big subgroup of the izazai but with them three are non pathan origin known as gaduns the swatis of allai and the tanawals
7698709 as has already been said there are certain tribes which by location and association are commonly styled pathans but are not so in reality
7698710 it is curious to find that swatis in hazara district describing themselves as pakhtuns and gaduns do the same though the only theory that they are perhaps connected with the kakar pathans is in my opinion rubbish they are not pathans at all in origin
7698711 the origin of the tribe gaduns or jaduns is not very clear but they certainly have no connection with the yusafzais among whom they dwell they claim descent from the family of ghurghusht but are more probably of rajput origin many of the descendants of jadu the founder of rajput dynasty emigrated from gujrat some eleven hundred years before christ to the hills of kabul and kandahar when they moved to mahaban range the tribe crossed the indus into hazara these have however lost all connection with their trans frontier tribesmen and are to all intents and purposes punjabis
7698712 the trans frontier clans contain about 2000 fighting men they do not enlist freely nor are they in request being considered to be of smaller fighting value than other pthans the trans indus gaduns are bounded by the utmanzais by amazais the tribesmen are all cultivators or cattle owners
7698713 about two thirds of the original utmanzai territory is now occupied by the gaduns who in old days were invited to cross the indus as mercenaries and were given in requital the lands they now hold on the western and southern slopes of mahaban mountain
7698714 this tribe is especially illustrious as the representative of buddha the founder of buddhist religion whose direct descendants are always regarded as yadus the original name has become strangely corrupted and the race is now seldom designated as yadu or yaduvana but commonly by the term jadu or jadun or jadubansi
7698715 the utman division of mandanr occupies the southern slopes of mahaban mountains on the west bank of the indus jointly with the gadun or jadun tribe these gadun represent the great yadu tribe their name became the patronymic of the descendants of buddha a progenitor of lunar race
7698716 those who try to identify the pathans exclusively with the jews or the aryans or the greeks or the white huns are not rationalists they base their opinions mostly on traditions and legends which cannot stand a scientific analysis the habitat of pathans is located such that all the foreign invaders of india pass through it leaving behind stragglers and deserters who settled permanently and thus mingled their blood with that of those among whom they lived the fact is that the pathans are the finished product of racial intermingling extending over three thousand years they have thus become a hybrid race and the distinction between afghan and pathanas made by caroe neither appeals to common sense nor conforms to the beliefs held by all the pashto speaking people
7698717 gaduns about 10 000 on the banks of indus although some speak pashto they can no longer be considered as pashtoon tribe
7698718 if we have to wait until after the election to do so then believe me were going back to the horrors of july 15 without a doubt
7698719 but wishes like hopes just arent part of the equations
7698720 its going to be very very difficult for the next few months
7698721 there are three negative things that are going on at present which will continue to overhang the markets
7698722 firstly the credit crisis is far from over secondly the u s economy is going to deteriorate in the second half of 2008 and will stay very weak until the end of next year
7698723 thirdly in the macroeconomic sense youre getting spillovers from the u s to the rest of the other major economies those three things interacting is going to take time for markets to work their way through
7698724 this convention is going to be so well orchestrated and put together that obama is going to come out with a big bump in the polls
7698725 were anticipating were going to reduce natural gas use in dublin ireland by 20 percent this year
7698726 when i learned the symbol of the islamic faith will appear on coca cola packaging during ramadan 2008 i found myself wondering whether or not the atlanta based soft drink maker will soon include the christian cross and jewish star of david in future holiday packaging designs targeting people of those faiths
7698727 in a globalizing world ramadan presents an opportunity to showcase the true values of islam and what it stands for
7698728 because no other brand is as inclusive as and no other company is as diverse as coca cola we have a unique opportunity to play a valued role as an international bridge builder and facilitator of dialogue during ramadan
7698729 in addition to the focus on ramadan and eid the coca cola system has also implemented policies and programs to meet the needs of muslim employees such as providing halal food in cafeterias and organizing special prayer rooms at company facilities
7698730 sometimes i wish i were a little kid again skinned knees are easier to fix than broken hearts
7698731 i think it would be great if they could increase funding for all the sports starting now not two years down the road when its very difficult to pull off good performances
7698732 its really great to represent canada and i hope i made everyone proud
7698733 all the hard work of the past four years is worth it

7698747 kara is going to be right in your face if she has to be

7698752 pr cticamente todas las comunidades comparten una tendencia hacia la baja en el n mero de constituciones y un incremento en el n mero de disoluciones con el informe correspondiente al segundo semestre del a o confirmaremos si esta tendencia responde a una coyuntura econ mica pasajera o se instalar en el largo plazo
7698753 el estudio de este a o confirma que cuando los elementos b sicos de servicio est n perfectamente implementados la calidad de servicio al cliente mejora por lo que aumenta tambi n la retenci n del cliente ha sido muy interesante comparar estos elementos de servicio con el nivel de prioridad y atenci n que les dan las organizaciones
7698754 la elecci n de un canal fue calificada entre los indicadores m s bajos que influyen en la mejora del servicio al cliente menos del 2 de los participantes seleccionaron esta opci n en sus tres primeras alternativas
7698755 teniendo en cuenta que solucionar el problema en la primera llamada es el mayor indicador de mejora del servicio al cliente nos sorprendi conocer que no todos los centros de contacto se han alineado con este objetivo
7698756 los centros de contacto todav a se basan en las m tricas de eficiencia est ndares la tasa de abandono es el indicador com nmente utilizado el 90 1 de los centros participantes lo consideran un factor clave mientras que s lo un 63 4 utiliza el rendimiento que supone la soluci n de problemas en la primera llamada estas conclusiones manifiestan la diferencia entre lo que los clientes buscan y el enfoque de los costes de los centros de contacto
7698757 comparado con los resultados del estudio de benchmarking del a o pasado estos n meros subrayan la tendencia de las organizaciones de reducir su inversi n en formaci n aunque las habilidades de comunicaci n y de servicio mejoran los niveles de satisfacci n y experiencia del cliente

7698816 i moved her out to l a to live with me i introduced her to music publishers kara and i wrote spinning around for kylie minogue when we were living together
7698817 i hope the audience gets excited and accepts it sometimes its been hard when weve had four judges in the past they always wanted four judges since the beginning itll be good to have two girls and two guys
7698818 this is just the start of the development application process we have to notify the public we have received it so that we can begin our own assessment process
7698819 we will be trying to convey that to heather when she arrives in town so if you see the committee out and about with her on wednesday be sure to give us a wave and smile
7698820 the best part of the assessment process for us is showing off what our community is all about i think people have heard us say before that it is not just about picking up papers it is about us as a community and the qualities we have as a community
7698821 the standard of wines in this years competition was really high higher than it has been in a long time
7698822 so it did come as a big surprise to win so many trophies
7698823 the most pleasing thing about the awards was they come across all categories
7698824 it is usually one or two wines that dominate the awards
7698825 however this year we had six different wines that won trophies
7698826 we get to see what we are doing right or what we are doing wrong and how we can improve and compete against other wine producers like barossa and margaret river
7698827 eight per cent of all the entries won a gold medal and 48 per cent won a medal of some sort which is a fantastic strike rate
7698828 there were also strong showings by some of the smaller wineries which is good to see

7698830 i wanted to do community organizing and i couldnt think of a better city than one as energized and hopeful as chicago was then
7698831 i was asking around among community activists in chicago and around the country and they kept mentioning him

7698838 today barack obama is a 21st century patriot who sees beyond the years
7698839 democrats will leave this convention unified organized and stronger than ever to take america in a new direction with barack obama and
7698840 i think its important for california to realize that we have two eastern senators on one ticket and then you have senator mccain who is often referred to as californias third senator

7698842 republican they think the democrats will take their guns away from them
7698843 sen obama made the right decision and i think for the right reasons
7698844 i was the national chair for hillary clinton as someone who worked hard for her no matter who you voted for we have a responsibility to the party to come together and unite
7698845 im disappointed i was hoping she was going to be the running mate
7698846 it was tough only because it was so emotional for me
7698847 when the people of my district meet him personally they will support him
7698848 im disappointed she was not chosen as the vice president i think he needed her
7698849 i would like to see the obama campaign and his administration take a more proactive role in acknowledging what women like me experience frequently in the business and political world and thats the lack of equality and blatant sexism thats what hillary encountered
7698850 there are some in the media that want to characterize it as a lack of unity we will have an opportunity to have our say we want to have our say then come together
7698851 this is really kind of putting a laser on a lot of different issues and policy concerns across the country saying this is exactly where the democratic party will take you
7698852 the urgency people feel in america is palpable and real and they want change they want to know how were going to change it and they want to know it now
7698853 i dont think anyone including president bush believes no child left behind is really working
7698854 people are getting frustrated on the education issue because it doesnt seem like anything is getting done
7698855 the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7698856 i was breathing a sigh for my father that night that he had come up short
7698857 yet i felt such great pride that there was such overwhelming support for him at that time
7698858 the rough and tumble of the primaries that all goes with the territory
7698859 my dad would always say when i was growing up from those to whom much is given much is expected
7698860 there was the other illness in the family that we never did talk about

7698862 its not the last place a person might own but a great place to build equity and move up
7698863 youre in a small space with great amenities and the resources of the city
7698864 i think were on the verge of enacting groundbreaking legislation
7698865 this is essential for us to begin to really start looking at toxics in products
7698866 right now everything we look at and have been looking at are emissions wastes and discharges
7698867 people are not only surprised to find that the state currently doesnt have authority over products that contain dangerous chemicals they expect that the state should
7698868 right now most californians assume that state government has the authority to take toxic products off the shelves thats actually not true except in a very few specific cases where the legislature has acted
7698869 but were encouraged by it this kind of format is much more preferred than what were dealing with in the legislature
7698870 the men approached the deputy wanting to know what was going on and did so in an aggressive verbal manner

7698874 did point out some gaps in the program some of which had already been addressed
7698875 there was a lot of expectation something would happen there on the night television channels were stalking around along with other media
7698876 it ended up a self fulfilling prophesy i question the effect of what they were doing
7698877 the motivation was to be there in the event something happened not to incite anything
7698878 i dont accept that at all we cannot ignore a big news event like this
7698879 so far today ive heard it was the fault of the retailers selling alcohol the fault of the media and the fault of the police what ive not heard is that it was the fault of those involved
7698880 at this stage i dont know really how to deal with it
7698881 what does this movie have to do with life after death

7698883 with obama we have words with mccain we have deeds with obama we have rhetoric with mccain we have a record
7698884 it makes me sad that mccain is using it against us
7698885 while investors generally have become more reluctant to invest in finance company offerings maracs re investment rate was maintained at normal historical levels of around 63 percent
7698886 in the second half of the year marac focused on meeting the needs of existing clients and foregoing some growth opportunities
7698887 being those which the company believes will not be collected in full

7698895 there is an agreement between both sides that no foreign soldiers will be in iraq after 2011
7698896 must be based on a specific deadline for the withdrawal of foreign forces and that it should not be open
7698897 an agreement has not been signed and so from our perspective there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed
7698898 but any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position it continues to be our position
7698899 weve been opposed to arbitrary dates on the calendar especially when things were tough from a security standpoint
7698900 as conditions improve it certainly enables us to have the discussion about goals going forward and where we hope iraqi security forces will be
7698901 illinois is america america we need you to be with barack obama
7698902 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

7698928 that flies in the face of just about every other number ive seen in this race and i think mason dixon had a bad night this poll is so far off the mark i cant even respond to it
7698929 does this mean that it turns off the backlighting leds for the pixels that are dark or black creating an effectively far deeper black
7698930 obamas stadium address on thursday the 45th anniversary of rev martin luther king jr s i have a dream speech will result in effusive and overwhelming press coverage this coverage will be impenetrable and will undoubtedly impact the polls
7698931 the one returns this time to lead us to the road to denver
7698932 we will encourage voters to look beyond the glamour of barack obamas celebrity status to his inexperience and lack of accomplishment
7698933 even democrats in ohio are calling on senator obama to offer something more than a lofty speech ohioans are beginning to wonder if theres anything more to barack obama than his trusty teleprompter
7698934 hiding out in one of your seven houses while your surrogates launch more low road attacks is not a surprising strategy for john mccain
7698935 but given his shocking disconnect with the struggles of american families john mccain would be better served using this time to rewrite his economic plan that was authored by an adviser who thinks we are a nation of whiners and which offers nothing more than the same failed bush economic policies of the last eight years
7698936 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7698937 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7698938 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7698939 a great american story modest means but big dreams and encouragement from loving parents
7698940 i think the guy will do a great job of managing our team and the team has responded really well to him and thats where we are going
7698941 weve worked extremely hard over the last two weeks and im proud to be a miami dolphin
7698942 i mean he doesnt know any of us from the man on the moon right now but he comes into the huddle and says give me your eyes
7698943 we didnt break the huddle good one time and he was like nah nah nah next time weve got to stand and break the huddle just stuff a veteran with great leadership would do its pretty exciting
7698944 he brings management skills to the table he can manage a game really well hes a little bit calmer in there hes seen more situations
7698945 the guy has seen some of these critical situations that are going to come up
7698946 and he understands the speed its going to be a whole lot faster when we play the jets the first game of the season
7698947 saves that network from slapping on a bumper sticker barack obama could cure cancer and theyd figure out a way to frame it as an economic disaster
7698948 im stunned to see karl rove on a news network as an analyst
7698949 but being out of touch with mainstream america is nothing new to jon as evidenced by the crash and burn ratings of this years oscars telecast
7698950 that false sense of urgency they create the sense that everything is breaking news the 24 hour networks are now driving the narratives and everyone else is playing catch up
7698951 they want him to win badly and yet dont like black people
7698952 an age joke about mccain is at this point somewhat meaningless because its already trite
7698953 he knows were there to introduce him to 20 year olds smoking out of apple bongs
7698954 im used to seeing these great big guys so when you sign them im getting my moneys worth
7698955 the farther you go the more you become convinced youve got somebody special
7698956 moving up to this car now its more pressure but i can handle it
7698957 there were other options but i think for the long term and whats in the best interest of jgr the home depot and our whole team joey was the guy
7698958 racing is a lot of little things that make it every time i go to the racetrack i learn things as long as i pick up something every time i go to the racetrack its going to be great
7698959 weve had a great 10 years weve got some pretty good stats to set our goals at right now and to use that as our motivating tools in the future weve got to win at least three next year like we did in 99
7698960 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7698961 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7698962 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7698963 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7698964 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7698965 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7698966 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7698967 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7698968 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7698969 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7698970 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7698971 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7698972 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7698973 talk about their life together and building a family grounded in faith and values
7698974 the trip gives us an opportunity to move forward both here in the u s government and also with our counterparts in europe who want to support georgias economic and military reconstruction
7698975 developments lately in georgia have increased the importance of this visit
7698976 to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7698977 cheney certainly has had a tougher view on russia than some others in the administration
7698978 would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
7698979 russias reputation has suffered since it took these disproportionate military steps in georgia
7698980 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7698981 with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7698982 people think im old im not that old yet so hopefully those healing cells are still in there
7698983 i have every reason to believe hes going to be there so my cups half full
7698984 but its only half full because theres a chance he could miss the first one
7698985 to be able to play through those things and show up on sunday is something i take pride in
7698986 it goes without saying that no future games will be scheduled between penn state and ohio state its probably just as well for ohio
7698987 senhor a quem iremos s tu tens palavras de vida eterna
7698988 i mean how many of the guys on that list hit three field goals of 50 or more yards
7698989 there arent many guys that did that he shouldve been on it
7698990 you deal with them you stay focused on the biggest product which is what youre trying to get done and then you move forward
7698991 to be honest i believe it might be a distraction
7698992 i believe a couple of guys may take it as a distraction may take it as man they should have told us a little earlier but the more mature guys are like ok whatever well move on
7698993 i dont think it is because we havent really been talking about it
7698994 we havent really been thinking about it its things that happened those guys are handling it well and i think well be all right
7698995 to have that kind of exposure people talking about ucla football in anticipation of this game is terrific
7698996 we want to be a national recruiter we want to have people across the united states to look at this game and say that would be a cool place to play
7698997 in terms of getting our program where we want it this is important to play on this kind of stage you dont have to look very far for an example of somebody who did just that right across town usc coach pete carroll he went out and played all these kind of games and fared favorably and obviously built a program that certainly is among the best if not the best right now
7698998 to go and lay an egg would probably have an initial negative repercussion but you can always point to the fact they tv wanted to see ucla they want ucla because of the los angeles market and so forth and were not going to lay an egg the next time
7698999 i dont like to talk in those terms because i prefer to look at it as if its going to go well
7699000 im really really happy with staff ive put together and the way they work with one another the way we get things accomplished and get to the heart of the matter rather than dancing around issues because of egos and stuff
7699001 i do think kevin and chris forcier are on the verge of blossoming into very good players hopefully it could be as soon as monday night
7699002 but even if we take our lumps early in the season i do believe they have the makeup to be good players
7699003 i dont know my schedule for next year i will be hitting golf balls at the beginning of the year
7699004 because of the growing demand for our product and services and with the success of our initial call we felt this was the perfect time to allow individuals to get involved
7699005 we also know many people are beginning to look for jobs more locally to subsidize the rising cost of gas
7699006 this is not just an opportunity to make money it is an opportunity to make a difference
7699007 we have provided a vehicle for individuals to help their families friends their communities etc by offering the companys inventory know how to the general public we have moved our knowledge of inventory from the warehouse to the living room
7699008 this is an excellent way to subsidize an income or to earn a living

7699022 stephen fry who writes a column about technology in the british
7699023 an idea in peoples heads rather than a reality its actually an idea that the reciprocity between the user and the provider is whats emphasised in other words genuine interactivity if you like simply because people can upload as well as download

7699026 although the population of bears has grown from a low of about 12 000 in the late 1960s to approximately 25 000 today our scientists advise me that computer modeling projects a significant population decline by the year 2050
7699027 the early estimates of polar bear abundance are a guess there is no data at all for the 1950 60s nothing but guesses we are sure the populations were being negatively affected by excess harvest e g aircraft hunting ship hunting self killing guns traps and no harvest limits the harvest levels were huge and growing the resulting low numbers of bears were due only to excess harvest but again it was simply a guess as to the number of bears
7699028 merely by summarising the various national counts which still must be considered inaccurate one reaches the conclusion that the worlds total polar bear population is probably closer to 20 000 animals than to the lower figures often suggested

7699127 it was my sophomore year and we found out we were having him
7699128 i was making good money doing landscaping it was just exhausting work
7699129 what im saying is its not about how you start but how you finish
7699130 today youre making decisions to go back and correct decisions you made in the past
7699131 just working and sitting around the house its really boring
7699132 the second week of school i really regretted it you miss all of your friends and seeing them cross the stage
7699133 ive always loved hospitals and kids and thats what ive wanted to do
7699134 throw that memory in the garbage disposal and flip the switch these firecrotches are way filthier than any girl youve ever been with they may be called carrot tops but these hot redheads are more likely to stick that carrot in their bottoms

7699137 in our own xcritic forums the demand for fiery redheads has been made clear fans of redheads will have a lot of freckles and red hair to appreciate jacks redhead adventure might be the start of a great new series

7699139 interview with keynote speaker former governor mark warner and not candidate for us senate
7699140 in our very first act we passed the 9 11 commission recommendations to protect the american people
7699141 you can do this god its easy for you bring my brother back to life
7699142 i have become more of a realist i know that none of us are immune from anything
7699143 i think through the past weeks and months and years with the media talking about my putting and writing about my putting and people talking about my putting and people wanting to help me i must have had hundreds of letters and phone calls and all saying that they can fix my putting it kind of gets in your head that youre not a good putter
7699144 so i made a point after last week that im going to change that attitude and i believed in myself that im the best putter and i came out here with a different attitude
7699145 if i keep doing this im going to win a lot more
7699146 i tried to bunt just to tie the game on the visitors side thats kind of weird
7699147 ive never seen anything like that and hopefully we never see that again especially when you lose a game when you wait this long
7699148 we are in a position where we have to beat the red sox but we have to win win win no matter who we play
7699149 they blow us out we blow them out close games we win close games we lose
7699150 we have to take advantage of this series with the red sox
7699151 this is our chance to move up in the standings its big for us
7699152 but now that theyve won a couple of championships they are able to relax a bit
7699153 in order to get this condition accepted every other part of hawaii has a 200 year old tradition of mixing eastern western and polynesian cuisine a thriving community of niche farmers ranchers fishermen and aquaculturalists and a 15 year old regional cuisine movement that has raised the bar for all hawaii restaurants big and small
7699154 i think as youre coming out of high school you obviously have huge expectations for yourself and ill definitely admit that i hold myself to a real high standard
7699155 obviously you want to go in there and come in with a full head of steam and what not but youve got to take time and coach weis helped me sit back and realize that
7699156 a lot of people dont remember that its not a normal college system
7699157 its an nfl system and youre making an even larger jump i think just the terminology the verbiage everything just jumps up and theres a lot more expectations i mean youre not going to come in and learn that in a day it takes time and you just really need to take time to go home and study your playbook
7699158 hes very very open he goes the extra mile to make sure i understand things
7699159 hes very business oriented and thats what was the most appealing thing about coach weis
7699160 he has a very challenging mood about him and hes going try to bring the best out of you and thats what you need as a quarterback
7699161 could come in and finish a game for us if he needed to which he might just do
7699162 i want to learn this offense as well as possible
7699163 youre going to get a competitive nature from me every day i step on the field
7699164 im just going in with a day by day mindset
7699165 we didnt get to the speed we wanted we tried a lot of different setups with the bike more weight less weight different body positions but we couldnt stop the wheel spin
7699166 we went better than last year and weve come away with some more ideas with what we want to do next time there was a strong kiwi contingent there this year and we got good support from the americans as well
7699167 the unveiling was a celebration for her and a chance for us to say our last goodbye
7699168 since her death we have been bringing up our three grandkids we got custody after she died
7699169 the kids have not heard or seen their mother for a year at the unveiling was the first time they had seen her
7699170 we are not angry there is no point whatever attitude we have wont bring our baby back
7699171 we are relaxing now that our darlings headstone is up all we do now is focus on our babies that are here
7699172 so youre probably talking about 20 per cent of the new project and relative to the rest of the roading network its sort of less than two or three per cent
7699173 we want to get that road built because it is the best thing you could do for hamilton
7699174 we want to see it completed as quick as possible and the reality is it is not going to get built under current proposals because it is outside the 10 year plan
7699175 personally i would want to see a toll free link between hamilton and auckland
7699176 there is a place for public private partnerships but we have to be extra careful we dont get into a position where the losses are in the public domain and profits in the private domain
7699177 and whatever funding mix we have we dont want to be paying double we are already paying petrol tax
7699178 europe should try to take steps to ease russias withdrawal from the security zones which are a real sticking point for moscow
7699179 russia doesnt want to retreat from areas in georgia proper that can serve as a staging area for the georgian military so thinking about how to make the sarkozy plan stick anything the european union can do to separate the forces and create a cordon sanitaire for diplomacy to proceed would be a step forward
7699180 the eu always has trouble speaking with a single voice
7699181 it will find consensus all the more difficult in this crisis in central europe theres a sense that we told you so russia is again an aggressor state and in western europe there is a much more complicated view of the war in georgia and an unwillingness to jump to the conclusion that its time to man the barricades and contain russia
7699182 and you could basically replace that entirely with a table or css to make a multi column footer that includes text java html etc
7699183 ah look at her doing better in her career than me bless her
7699184 we havent announced it yet but were looking at it very closely i think we will make some changes
7699185 we are worried about security of supply but my personal view is they are damn ugly
7699186 after about the 10th fake facebook site for me we decided to set one up feel free to join

7699200 what i hope to accomplish is to have the people who feel the same way as i do to come out and support john mccain
7699201 you told the democratic party in wisconsin at the time that you were willing to learn more about barack obama that you wanted to give him a chance
7699202 i wanted the opportunity to hear him speak but they chose not to have me go to the convention and so after looking at the issues and trying to learn about sen obama every time i tried to learn about him he seems to change his mind on a lot of the issues
7699203 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really

7699233 for too long certain elements within our city have enjoyed cake and ice cream with utter impunity
7699234 but i have a message for those people your days of slow dancing and playing pin the tail on the donkey are over
7699235 if youre out there commemorating the birth of a child or entering into jewish manhood youd better watch your back from now on operation baby shower was just the tip of the iceberg
7699236 lens going to go on the stand and say vince made me delete damaging e mails
7699237 trust me vince wouldve other fumo allies who also requested anonymity agreed
7699238 luchkos testimony is really going to strengthen the fbis case
7699239 if fumo couldve just pressed a button or you know made a phone call to make luchko disappear i think he wouldve done it
7699240 vinces reputation has been made on playing hardball and if hed known luchko would sing like this well lets just say he wouldve taken action
7699241 its not quite sold out yet but the arena will still be full of leather vests and confederate flag t shirts
7699242 so obviously thatll translate into literally dozens of teeth as well

7699250 ive always liked weird glasses but i never had more than a couple of pairs
7699251 now its like all i can think about im thinking about it right now
7699252 im in talks with carl dranoff for a new place in south philly and ive got a few other things up my sleeve theres more to life than retro eyeglasses you know
7699253 theres all this stuff in the news trying to make staycations sound all fun but this has been the absolute worst

7699255 i put up the badminton net for the kids and ive been making my special hot dogs you know to make it fun
7699256 but the fun lasted about two minutes i dont know if i can take six more days of this

7699259 sure itll affect reading boscovs is one of the citys biggest employers
7699260 but this underwear is so comfortable i just dont feel like thinking about their problems right now
7699261 it stinks that an independent company like boscovs is having so much trouble
7699262 but im kind of like whatever about it i mean im just so cozy
7699263 just look at how these boxer briefs both cradle and allow for some freedom down there
7699264 nows not really the time to think about bankruptcy and whatnot
7699265 in his letters he complained that it was too hot that there were too many bugs
7699266 and i could tell he was homesick for petes sake he sent me a letter a day sometimes two
7699267 i thought i could maybe make some new friends but it didnt really happen
7699268 i thought this one kid brian was okay but deep down i could tell he didnt really like me
7699269 donovan just didnt mesh with the other kids he was very fragile emotionally
7699270 one of our activities was football and whenever he played you could just tell his heart wasnt in it he seemed to prefer arts and crafts
7699271 sometimes it was cool like when my counselor pat shurmur snuck in pizza after lights out but mostly i kind of hated it
7699272 if its not going to be used there then why not make it available to other people who have submitted requests and have been in the queue for water for a long period of time
7699273 in the interest of fairness i would say if hes not serious about building out the restaurant he should say what hes doing with it
7699274 we reviewed all the medical records and spoke with the victims physician and the evidence showed that the loss of the fetus was not related to or a result of the crash caused by the defendant

7699280 i wish he just would have went in the house and would have came and told me instead of retaliating that way
7699281 he was showing his teeth growling and he was coming at me
7699282 the second dog i didnt know i didnt think i was going to have to shoot him because he seemed a little hesitant but then he looked at the hole in the fence i thought he was going to go back under then he turned around and started coming at me and thats when i shot him

7699310 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner

7699342 making a big ass mess is one of my favorite parts of riding the train

7699347 this far reaching program will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7699348 over the course of the 2006 and 2007 financial years we achieved 52 million in ongoing real cost reductions
7699349 cost synergies associated with the merger of fairfax media and rural press and the acquisition of southern cross radio produced a further 53 million in savings
7699350 all of these synergies will be realised by the end of this financial year
7699351 knowing her nose better than anyone else i was in a unique position to take care of the problem

7699354 but i dont think im allowed to disclose that right now i dont want to risk having a shit storm the last four or five records we did were just so compromised by that major label situation but thats the way it goes

7699357 ik zal het iets scherper zeggen u moet het niet durven om morgen uit de ministerraad te komen zonder de boodschap van een referendum dan hebt u niet alleen een probleem met mij maar dan hebt u vooral een probleem met alle kiezers in nederland die twee jaar geleden in grote meerderheid nee hebben gezegd
7699358 ik zal het iets scherper zeggen u moet het niet durven om morgen uit de ministerraad te komen zonder de boodschap van een referendum

7699363 madison is a generally safe place to live and work
7699364 but it faces the challenges of any growing city including crime safety in madison is a partnership among residents police the university and the city
7699365 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7699366 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7699367 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7699368 complete redeployment within 16 months from and higher taxes on families earning over 250 000 a year roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7699369 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7699370 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7699371 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7699372 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7699373 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7699374 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7699375 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though
7699376 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7699377 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7699378 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7699379 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7699380 i hate the feeling that you shouldnt wear your hillary gear unless there are two or three of you together
7699381 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7699382 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7699383 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7699384 i cant imagine not going into a convention and hearing alabama and the whole world looking up to see what comes next
7699385 but as typical of these roll calls at a certain point somebody has the votes and the protocol and graciousness come through and that will have its own dynamic
7699386 we are not unicorns we are not going to just show up
7699387 my view is we need to come together as a party
7699388 i admire hillary clinton greatly but i think it would be divisive to have a vote on the floor we need to have a unanimous vote
7699389 we just want a roll call like youre supposed to have
7699390 i came out here by god to vote for her and im going to do it
7699391 she is our captain we dont want to see her disrespected
7699392 i think the votes should be cast and counted the way they have been historically
7699393 but i dont think every delegate needs to stand and say something i want a good convention
7699394 ive seen the petition but im not going to focus on that
7699395 hay una concentraci n muy interesante de gente calificada en buenos aires
7699396 hubo una percepci n generalizada de que los mercados de ingenier a estaban saturados y esto claramente ya no es el caso
7699397 if obama is elected president and i believe that he will be it will mark the end of racism and prejudice in america
7699398 a believer in people and the good they can do
7699399 no one wants an angry african american man in the white house

7699401 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
7699402 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7699403 to us that would be unacceptable russia needs to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia
7699404 we consider this decision another step in russias fight against georgian sovereignty
7699405 i see no real importance from the legal point of view that this decision may have for the future of abkhazia and south ossetia
7699406 abkhazia and south ossetia cannot become independent states just as a result of the russian parliaments decision
7699407 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7699408 we will take any decision including up to a complete break in relations if nato countries decide to suspend co operation with russia
7699409 there has been a dramatic worsening of our relations with nato but we are not to blame
7699410 we would like to have a full fledged relationship and partnership but we dont need the illusion of a partnership
7699411 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7699412 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7699413 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7699414 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7699415 no one works for someone we all just work together
7699416 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7699417 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
7699418 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
7699419 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
7699420 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
7699421 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7699422 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7699423 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7699424 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7699425 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7699426 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7699427 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7699428 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7699429 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7699430 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7699431 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7699432 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7699433 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7699434 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7699435 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7699436 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7699437 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7699438 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7699439 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7699440 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7699441 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7699442 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7699443 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7699444 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7699445 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7699446 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7699447 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7699448 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7699449 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7699450 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7699451 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7699452 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7699453 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7699454 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7699455 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7699456 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7699457 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7699458 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7699459 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7699460 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7699461 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7699462 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7699463 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7699464 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7699465 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7699466 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7699467 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7699468 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7699469 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7699470 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7699471 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7699472 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7699473 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7699474 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7699475 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7699476 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7699477 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7699478 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7699479 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7699480 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7699481 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7699482 tudo me l cito mas nem tudo me conv m
7699483 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7699484 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7699485 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7699486 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7699487 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7699488 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7699489 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7699490 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7699491 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7699492 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7699493 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7699494 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7699495 this is a planning took where all things are going
7699496 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7699497 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7699498 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7699499 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7699500 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7699501 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7699502 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7699503 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7699504 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7699505 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7699506 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7699507 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7699508 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7699509 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7699510 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7699511 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7699512 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7699513 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7699514 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7699515 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7699516 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7699517 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7699518 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7699519 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7699520 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7699521 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7699522 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7699523 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7699524 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7699525 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7699526 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7699527 a film critics manifesto takes directors down a peg puts writers on top and turns hollywood on its head
7699528 one of the difficulties of criticism is that you are remote from the people youre criticizing for you are probably more sophisticated than your average reader youve certainly seen more than your average reader just the same as the ballet master or the choreographer doesnt represent the audience any more so you do have to be very careful that youre not adopting too elitist a view or be aware when you are adopting an elitist view
7699529 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7699530 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7699531 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7699532 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7699533 we cannot do anything its a global force and what can we do
7699534 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7699535 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7699536 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7699537 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7699538 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7699539 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7699540 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7699541 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7699542 little olive we will miss you but always remember you
7699543 hard to avoid the conclusion that sales have bottomed out
7699544 inventories are very high relative to sales rates and would probably be even more so if all those wishing to sell their home actually had the house on the market instead of pulling it off in the face of weak demand and eroding prices
7699545 there is still a considerable distance to travel before prices sink to levels necessary to balance supply and demand in the housing market
7699546 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7699547 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7699548 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7699549 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7699550 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7699551 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7699552 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7699553 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7699554 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7699555 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7699556 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7699557 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7699558 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7699559 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7699560 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7699561 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7699562 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7699563 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7699564 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7699565 fatally defective to describe the latest indictment bonds attorneys argue that baseballs all time home run king cannot defend himself because many of the perjury allegations are too vague
7699566 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7699567 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7699568 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7699569 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7699570 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7699571 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7699572 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7699573 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7699574 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7699575 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7699576 we have to find a way of managing our budget so that were less vulnerable
7699577 nice piece 5 yrs old belongs to my gf and she wants to sell it
7699578 my client was contacted by the fbi at her job and was told a little bit about what her husbands activities were
7699579 she was completely blindsided she had no idea of the double life this man was leading
7699580 cindy is not here today and im sorry shes not
7699581 shes on her way to the little country of georgia
7699582 georgia back in the third century the king of georgia converted to christianity you see churches there that date back to the fourth and fifth century
7699583 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7699584 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7699585 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7699586 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7699587 texas case law recognizes few restrictions on the lawful use of property
7699588 is going to kill all the arguments about filing a lawsuit because you dont like the way a turbine looks
7699589 thats something you can objectively fight about in court but the issue of whats pretty and whats ugly we cant argue about that
7699590 its really affected the tone and tenor of the site
7699591 the problem is that the relationship in identity between an avatar and the real person behind it is quite tenuous
7699592 no specific members are appointed but leaders in the community emerge
7699593 i think making someone wear something of a scarlet letter is a good way of doing things
7699594 this is such a nascent area when it comes to the law
7699595 if a certain world allows you to be a thief is it a crime or just an aspect of the game should real world law apply
7699596 i thought the hardware part was a husk while the juicy parts were tossed away with the spinout
7699597 the meat they clearcube had was their existing customer relationships in an ongoing business and an optimized hardware for blades
7699598 it was much less a loss than all of us anticipated
7699599 it was discount discount discount to make revenue then you turn around and youre not making any money
7699600 boats on three 1 2 3 boats klapp klapp swoosj
7699601 there was a time when monroe county had no skate parks
7699602 this is probably going to be the last park we build for a long time
7699603 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7699604 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7699605 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7699606 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7699607 i think this is a great place to get a little attention on what no child left behind is doing to our kids and to our teachers
7699608 i just slapped it together with some glue and put it on
7699609 all of you are aware of the serious nature of this years fire season and the issues faced by the agency in paying for fire suppression costs
7699610 at this time the only option for financing the shortfall is to use the agencys transfer authority
7699611 the unfortunate thing is that it is across the board
7699612 i recognize that this direction will have a significant effect on agency operations
7699613 however we must be in a position to protect life and property from wildfire and do so within the funds available to the agency
7699614 the fire season in montana and across the country is far from over not to mention we have good paying jobs to fund and projects around the state that need to be completed
7699615 funding should not be pulled from our states resources to help pay for fighting fires in california
7699616 the costs are high and they need to suppress these fires to protect people
7699617 but the forest service is basically becoming the fire service
7699618 los dos son grandes jugadores a messi le falta la experiencia y ganar lo que gan diego pero va en camino

7699620 est claramente demostrado que cuando se trata de apoyar a barack obama se al las celebridades que lo respaldan no entienden de l mites en cuanto a campa as difamatorias o ataques
7699621 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7699622 this could give you an almost infinite number of switches and options for communication
7699623 its easy and somebody could learn an entirely different language
7699624 i would think that freescale with a new ceo would think about unloading that business they very well may be out looking for a buyer the best option for shareholders may be to sell and move on
7699625 we are engaged with other large cell phone makers and working on broadening relationships to get this business back on a growth path
7699626 motorolas lack of success is very clearly a challenge for us
7699627 the announcement could cause freescale to react or make a decision
7699628 it is like holding on to a stock that is losing money every day
7699629 i dont see freescales cell phone business as a good fit with anybody
7699630 if it is priced right a buyer would want some of the business and some of the engineers and the seller would welcome that and then you write a great press release
7699631 the future is about having a platform in the cloud
7699632 over the next decade you are going to see an incredible transformation in my opinion
7699633 it doesnt really make sense for most companies to have their own data centers just as it doesnt make sense for most companies to produce their own electric power
7699634 if you store a gigabyte of data for a month well send you a bill for 15 cents
7699635 to me cloud computing conjures up the image of something being very fluid and being very flexible
7699636 the benefits of the cloud are not only time to market but also pay as you go type of model
7699637 history shows us that the most disruptive and market changing technologies are ones that enable a broad class of people to do what previously only an elite class could do
7699638 i think it is a very very significant transformation the simplest way that i would explain it to my neighbor who isnt in the industry is that you know theres a computer on the desktop theres that computer in the data center you know that you walk by in your company but theres a new computer that is available up in the cloud and it is going to be transformational in terms of how people write and build solutions once they can assume that they can leverage that resource up there
7699639 salesforce com has done more than anybody just because of their willingness to go after the market
7699640 the big difference is that cloud computing is a much simpler approach that is easier for people to get from idea to application in a shorter period of time
7699641 the complexity is removed theres no need to think about software and versions things dont break as often the whole goal of cloud computing is to make business applications as easy as buying a book on amazon com
7699642 one of the big trends in cloud computing is not to make any one server super robust or super redundant but to handle redundancy through software
7699643 if a single server goes down or a rack or a whole data center goes down another one picks up
7699644 how much of your information do you really want hosted off site
7699645 thats a thorny little question that has to be addressed in order for cloud computing to work your data has to be stored off of your premises
7699646 as the industry solves both of those reliability and security i think were going to see massive massive scale out in the cloud
7699647 even if its a wild success today its going to blow your mind in the next two to three years
7699648 i was so angered by their sneakiness that i paid off and terminated my citicard account immediately said chan 43 a religious studies professor from new city n y citigroup declined to comment on the specifics of his case
7699649 less risky borrowers will have to absorb the costs posed by riskier borrowers if issuers cant price everyone based on the risk they pose said ken clayton senior vice president of card policy at the american bankers association
7699650 now more than ever we need to end unfair and deceptive credit card lending practices that make it difficult for consumers to control their credit and manage their debt maloney said
7699651 instead of teasing people with low introductory rates giving cards to anyone who breathes and then hitting them with fees and penalties on the back end lenders can still price for risk they just have to do it on the front end susswein said
7699652 any time for any reason increases to rates and fees last spring
7699653 i tied all the construction to classic craftsmanship i wanted it to feel old fashioned and classic but still luxurious and flexible to anyone who wants to live in and enjoy this wonderful neighborhood for what it is
7699654 joyce had a great vision and you never really know at first if a client actually has a plan or the ability to actually pull it off
7699655 obviously joyce pulled it off and then some it turned out to be an awesome project and really stunning results i smile every time i drive past her house
7699656 people to know that i feel i did save this house
7699657 the men are just much more comfortable than the women
7699658 women sometimes take overly conservative positions and sometimes then they dont make as much money as men
7699659 its true that most men are willing to take more risks than women
7699660 the battle between greed and fear is involved in all investing
7699661 there is a little more greed in the guys and a little more fear in the girls
7699662 men are more willing to make decisions without studying them
7699663 they also feel like they can beat up the market on the other hand when women get involved they are more diligent workers they study they talk they learn they dont have the urge to beat the market
7699664 its the overtrading that causes men to have lower returns
7699665 on average both men and women tend to make trades that they would be better off not making but men just make more of them
7699666 my point was that we had gone eight years since the last serious problem in capital markets and that thered been all of this innovation paulson said in an interview last month
7699667 no one would have predicted the russian default in 98 or some of the things that happened in asia he says
7699668 i cant remember when treasury has been so deeply involved in the structure of securities markets says james cox a professor at duke university who specializes in securities law
7699669 one of my management principles is to define your job expansively paulson says
7699670 hank paulson blew a supreme opportunity to make a substantial reform forbes says
7699671 if you have a bazooka in your pocket and people know it you probably wont have to use it he said at a july 15 senate hearing
7699672 it is the lack of clarity of what exactly the government is going to do and what congress is going to do that is sending shivers through investors said axel merk president and portfolio manager of merk investments llc in palo alto california
7699673 no but im sure itll be in the last place you look itll turn up
7699674 zardari becoming the president would be the most unfortunate event in pakistans history
7699675 a thug is going to be the president of this country
7699676 we have no options ahead of us once again they are taking turns in power this is zardaris turn after that it will be nawazs turn he is equally irresponsible and corrupt
7699677 it was an unnatural alliance and it has reached its natural end
7699678 to fall in love is to create a religion with a fallible god i dont remember who spoke these words it doesnt really matter what matters is that it is true i did fall in love but you are not fallible yet
7699679 its okay i understand like i said you dont have to apologize for something that you dont feel and for something that you do
7699680 ill try to get over you for my sake dont worry about me reach for the stars
7699681 we are going through tough financial times the mayor has passed a balanced budget looking two to three years out the city cannot afford to operate the way it has
7699682 there is nothing wrong with doing a city property inventory but putting the fox in charge of doing that the entity that is going to profit from their sale it would be shocking if they came up with a recommendation not to sell properties
7699683 were going to see if we can get him turned loose on a farm somewhere
7699684 were going to take him a long way from this building

7699696 ive got a couple of thoughts id like to add
7699697 call to get a date with jsto and then little pull off tabs like fliers in college with my name and cell number on them
7699698 i wouldnt consider it a long shot a number of times already hes shown his willingness to come to new jersey and jersey city on two or three occasions
7699699 i wouldnt speculate on that i know that obama is very grateful to mayor healy and his work because hes said so numerous times publicly im confident hell help us some way of course when youre president of the united states youve got a lot of other things on his plate
7699700 i think it should matter because it shows the type of judgment that jerramiah healy has because he recognized what kind of special person he was and took really a bold risk in endorsing him when the party apparatus in the state was on the other side and when hillary clinton was ahead in the polls by 20 points
7699701 and he did it not out of political calculation h did it because it was the right thing
7699702 its very difficult if not all together impossible to target a direct source
7699703 studies suggest that the amount of bioenergy generated from switchgrass can greatly exceed the amount used in production resulting in a favorable net energy production researchers calculate yields of up to 1 000 gallons of cellulosic ethanol per acre another plus its extensive root system holds soil in place and helps retain water
7699704 what a great asset thank you for all your hard work and diligence

7699718 i enjoy learning things in different ways other than the way other people learn them
7699719 of course why not if there is a suspension of military cooperation this is military cooperation
7699720 no one with common sense can expect to cooperate with russia in one part of the world while acting against it in another
7699721 its not in russias interests for nato to be defeated and leave behind all these problems
7699722 wed prefer nato to complete its job and then leave this unnatural geography
7699723 but at the same time well be the last ones to moan about natos departure
7699724 i have a lot of work to do the pace was slow but theyre amazing athletes i maintained my composure i know this sounds crazy but i think i could have won that on the right night i still have so much improvement left

7699751 ive decided to call him my face he is male runs a mile in
7699752 sadly i think this is probably linked with the current society where litigation is rife and i feel that schools are probably trying to avoid a child being hurt and an irresponsible mother then trying to sue them for it
7699753 the issue around the gymnastics is around the safety of the kids and it was not motivated by any concept of litigation

7699776 without it we would not learn grow and evolve however its adverse side effects make it especially important that we utilize what nature provided to heal those negative effects everyone ought to supplement their diet with adaptogens

7699786 it is our belief based on a witness account and information learned through the autopsy performed by the san diego county coroner that mr hirschfield was not the aggressor and was not involved in a brawl with police officers prior to being executed by this police officer it is our heartfelt belief that the manner in which this police officer handled this situation is consistent with somebody who might hold some preconceived notions against gay people
7699787 the most interesting way is by tracking google trends and then correlating that with the stories in addition we try to cut a lot of stories out because theyre malformed or are rated poorly by the internal system but theres lots more were keeping secret right now
7699788 within the next coming weeks well start recommending sponsored content that is related to specific feed items rather than the page as a whole
7699789 we can show a much broader variety of ads on each page thereby increasing the chances that people will actually click on ads
7699790 google has tried with their coupon api but they simply dont have enough localized content to make good money off local ads
7699791 were focused on providing the best user experience and will only be showing advertisements that are relevant and related to the content we distribute

7699800 in our view this data is a strong indicator that performance of the mobile carriers network is affecting the iphone 3g more than the handset itself
7699801 altogether this furthers our thesis that its highly unlikely that apple is going to wave a magic wand and say 3g problems be gone with a software update
7699802 by 2020 we might have nine billion people on the planet we could have a very big middle class driving millions more cars and we could be in a really resource hungry world with the oil price climbing and a supply situation in libya russia and saudi where natural gas is limited
7699803 it is those drivers those conditions which will encourage the possibility of landfill mining
7699804 once plastic is in a landfill site it pretty much sits there doing nothing and the beauty of that is that youre able to go back and recapture it in the future
7699805 there are some really buoyant prices around because plastic is all manufactured from oil so as the raw price of oil goes up every commodity derived from it goes up accordingly
7699806 over a period of a very long time many decades we have had a policy of burying whatever we can in landfill sites so there are valuable resources in those sites
7699807 and wherever there are valuable resources there is always the temptation to investigate whether its worth recovering them the logic is sound but the practicalities are complex and you have to balance those out with the commercial viability
7699808 several pilot studies have been carried out for research or pre feasibility studies in countries in europe but also in china japan and india
7699809 for example landfills in sweden dating from the 1960s have a lot of waste building material reflecting the construction boom of that era
7699810 and other landfills have very specific waste like those used by vehicle breakers which have high concentrations of aluminum copper and iron scrap
7699811 the value of these materials varies daily with global market prices and today there is considerable demand for scrap metal from china for instance
7699812 just imagine the resources that are lying in those landfills it could be incredible
7699813 we hear about climate change as a political issue an environmental issue and an economic issue we want to press the point that this is a moral issue

7699818 dan kita harus melakukan itu sebelum israel merasa punggungnya menyentuh dinding
7699819 posisi kami ialah tak ada pilihan yang akan diangkat dari meja tapi untuk sementara kita harus membuat kemajuan diplomatik
7699820 saya minta anda pada orang di antara anda yang mendukung saya saya akan berterima kasih selamanya untuk bekerja sekeras mungkin bagi barack obama sekeras anda bekerja untuk saya pada saat pemilihan pendahuluan

7699824 portuguese players like all the glamour perfume look all nice and here people just get down and get dirty
7699825 this is bizarre but when you think about it it makes training so much more fun
7699826 the sport is also a symbolical mental liberation from the restraining yoke of being constantly within reach
7699827 its our nature to create fun happenings probably because our summers are so short
7699828 at first it was difficult to promote them as they were small local events where people did not speak any foreign language
7699829 but now they are raising the interest of foreign press and visitors probably because they are so different from anything else going in their own countries

7699849 unfortunately their aircraft was not able to land so we initiated search operations as early as that around 10 last night their aircraft is still missing up to now and were conducting search and rescue operations concentrating on the 20 mile radius around davao city international airport
7699850 were still verifying really as to what really transpired because this is something very unusual the aircraft and the pilots were all ok before take off and everything was normal until that time
7699851 i will vote for anwar he represents the voice of the people god willing he will win
7699852 i have no more faith in umno because theres corruption and abuse of power
7699853 of course why not if there is a suspension of military cooperation this is military cooperation
7699854 no one with common sense can expect to cooperate with russia in one part of the world while acting against it in another
7699855 its not in russias interests for nato to be defeated and leave behind all these problems
7699856 wed prefer nato to complete its job and then leave this unnatural geography
7699857 but at the same time well be the last ones to moan about natos departure

7699866 most of the women in these stories are lonely and needy and allow themselves to be betrayed and neglected by men they cling to because they fear being alone
7699867 it was a good day as far as we know
7699868 thats a hard thing to do because they are part of the learning experience
7699869 but at the same time were like everybody else we hope those things will make a little bit of difference
7699870 win the prize which god has prepared for us in jesus christ
7699871 i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7699872 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7699873 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world
7699874 we are after all democrats so it may take a while
7699875 were not the fall in line party we are diverse but make no mistake we are unified
7699876 i said mr president you can say whatever you like bill clinton is a unique figure in our politics
7699877 there may be a few of us who go for mccain but most of us understand we need to kick republicans out of the white house
7699878 want a leader whose judgment and experience they can trust
7699879 i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7699880 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago

7699887 the springboks will get worse if they continue in this way
7699888 mate no one in world rugby is playing the way their coach is talking about not successfully anyway
7699889 everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game
7699890 this is still a very good squad of players most are even at their peak or approaching it so there is plenty of talent but what they need is the organisation and discipline
7699891 the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally and this is one of the most difficult teams to coach
7699892 theyre attacking off everything and theyre going lateral not through defences you have to go through sides like australia and new zealand first
7699893 but he has to change his philosophy because it doesnt fit these players its not credible
7699894 peters big test now is to learn if he learns he can turn it around but if he continues to be stubborn he wont last long because his tactics wont work
7699895 if a company is doing badly then you blame the managing director so it is right and fair that the coach be held responsible
7699896 we should have won the opportunities were there but we just let them slip
7699897 im not going to panic because having watched the video again i saw how great we played
7699898 decision making in split seconds is new to the guys and it has been a bit worrying the onus is now on the player but they want to be in a confined group where they are comfortable
7699899 every one of us could stand up and recite all the reasons why we must elect barack
7699900 none of that will happen if john mccain is in the white house i just want to make it absolutely clear we cannot afford four more years of george w bushs failed policies in america and thats what we would get with john mccain
7699901 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7699902 so let there be no mistake about it we are united we are united for change
7699903 we have to find a way of managing our budget so that were less vulnerable
7699904 draw it again his lord spoke to him and make it even more beautiful than the first
