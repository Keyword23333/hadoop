4750000 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4750001 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4750002 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4750003 while it is early days to say what the security situation is going to look like in georgia longer term the events of the past few days deal a blow to the u s s plans to support existing and new oil and gas routes that bypass russia
4750004 what happened in georgia has come on the back of other events in russia that have increased market concerns
4750005 together these are increasing the risk perception around the russian market
4750006 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
4750007 youre taking advantage of lonely people that have no other way to satisfy themselves so they pay you money
4750008 now with the signature of the georgian president on the ceasefire accord all russian troops and any irregular and paramilitary forces that entered with them must leave immediately in order to stabilise the situation in georgia we need international observers on the scene fast and eventually we need a more robust and impartial international force that will follow those observers
4750009 thats really nice i knew i liked california they would never do something like that back home
4750010 absolutely i would because if you cant keep your faith to your most sacred vow til death do us part how in the world can i trust you to lead my family my government
4750011 posting a 184 percent year over year increase compared to a 53 percent year over year increase in default notices and an 11 percent year over year increase in auction notices
4750012 american troops would join the polish military at least temporarily at the front lines facing east toward russia
4750013 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people
4750014 poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4750015 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4750016 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4750017 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4750018 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4750019 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4750020 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4750021 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4750022 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4750023 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4750024 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4750025 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4750026 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4750027 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4750028 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4750029 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4750030 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4750031 i had several specific childhood dreams and ive actually achieved most of them more importantly i have found ways in particular the creation with don marinelli of of helping many young people actually achieve their childhood dreams this talk will discuss how i achieved my childhood dreams being in zero gravity designing theme park rides for disney and a few others and will contain realistic advice on how you can live your life so that you can make your childhood dreams come true too
4750032 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4750033 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4750034 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4750035 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4750036 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4750037 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4750038 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4750039 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4750040 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4750041 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4750042 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4750043 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4750044 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4750045 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4750046 derives its moral authority from a womans right to choose safe and legal abortion
4750047 a notable omission is the clintonian phrase safe legal and rare replaced by a more honest and modest goal of reducing unintended pregnancy through better health care family planning and comprehensive sex education sex education was not even mentioned in the old platform
4750048 the progressive pro life desire to see the platform commit to reducing abortions was subtly undercut this year the platform merely recognizes that sex ed family planning and good health care will have the effect of reducing the need for abortion
4750049 in all other areas the platform uses strong language of commitment the party strongly and unequivocally supports roe and strongly supports access to affordable family planning services
4750050 even the platforms support for pre and post natal care and income support for women who have children is properly framed as a right on its own and not as a means to reducing the need for abortion
4750051 the biggest disappointment the ppers pro life progressives acknowledged about the platform was that it did not moralize about abortion but jim wallis took solace in the belief that the plank makes room for people with moral convictions about abortion as if those of us who support the right to choose have no moral conviction that undergirds our respect for choice
4750052 in recent years the antiabortion movement successfully put the nitty gritty details of abortion procedures on public display increasing the belief that abortion is serious business and that some societal involvement is appropriate those who are pro choice have not convinced america that we support a public discussion of the moral dimensions of abortion
4750053 first serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
4750054 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4750055 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4750056 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4750057 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4750058 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4750059 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4750060 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4750061 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4750062 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4750063 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4750064 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4750065 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4750066 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4750067 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4750068 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4750069 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4750070 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4750071 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4750072 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4750073 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4750074 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4750075 if the boolean value from the database is true display corresponding text from that record in a label otherwise mark the label with the text private
4750076 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4750077 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4750078 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4750079 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4750080 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4750081 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4750082 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4750083 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4750084 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4750085 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4750086 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4750087 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4750088 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4750089 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4750090 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4750091 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4750092 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4750093 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4750094 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4750095 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4750096 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4750097 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4750098 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4750099 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4750100 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
4750101 he is going down as the worst president ever the facts are in
4750102 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4750103 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4750104 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4750105 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4750106 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4750107 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4750108 ireland is a much more multi faith society these days people are looking for something a bit more unusual there are two trends at the moment there is a decrease in organised faith and large numbers of people are professing no faith at all but scientology is coming from a different place completely
4750109 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4750110 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4750111 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4750112 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4750113 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4750114 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4750115 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4750116 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4750117 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4750118 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4750119 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4750120 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4750121 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4750122 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4750123 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4750124 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4750125 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4750126 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4750127 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4750128 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4750129 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4750130 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4750131 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4750132 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4750133 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4750134 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4750135 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4750136 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4750137 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4750138 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4750139 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4750140 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4750141 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4750142 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4750143 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4750144 ave you seen gary i ad to ave words wiv im
4750145 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4750146 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4750147 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4750148 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4750149 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4750150 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4750151 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4750152 at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesus and said unto his servants this is john the baptist he is risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him for herod had laid hold on john and bound him and put him in prison for herodias sake his brother philips wife for john said unto him it is not lawful for thee to have her and when he would have put him to death he feared the multitude because they counted him as a prophet but when herods birthday was kept the daughter of herodias danced before them and pleased herod whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask and she being before instructed of her mother said give me here john baptists head in a charger and the king was sorry nevertheless for the oaths sake and them which sat with him at meat he commanded it to be given her and he sent and beheaded john in the prison and his head was brought in a charger and given to the damsel and she brought it to her mother and his disciples came and took up the body and buried it and went and told jesus when jesus heard of it he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart and when the people had heard thereof they followed him on foot out of the cities
4750153 honery or mean and vicious rude or trouble maker child
4750154 from john gills exposition of the entire bible e sword edition
4750155 i was reading this about john the baptist realized he lost his head for calling it adultery therefore i have no business performing marriages of people who have been divorced
4750156 if one of your daughters or sons get a divorce and want to remarry and they come to you to do the ceremony you will change your thinking
4750157 no i wont because my kids have more respect for me than to ask and even if they did my answer would be no
4750158 my acceptance speech was the best speech i ever gave
4750159 and it went on at 3 a m eastern time so nobody saw it
4750160 very future oriented agenda focused on solving key problems like health care well leave the negative messages to the republicans
4750161 and thats how we get competitive in the indianas and virginias
4750162 thats why i pay more attention to the registration figures than to the polls i see at this time of year
4750163 the polls will change but we know we need 200 000 new voters to be competitive in georgia and now is when we have to get them
4750164 the big difference this year is not the technology its the coordination
4750165 the president informed participants of the security council meeting that he had just now signed the six point plan
4750166 who i am is not good enough to be liked by others
4750167 we make our own decisions about what we consider newsworthy
4750168 the nomination of the first african american presidential nominee after a bitter primary campaign and his efforts to unite a party afterward were simply more newsworthy than a candidate whose nomination was already assured and who spent much of that time raising money in the end we can and should be judged on the fairness of our coverage but that is a judgment that must be made over the course of the whole campaign not a single period of time
4750169 cycling is far more of a team sport than spectators realize and its an embarrasment worth cringing over that ive stood on the podium of the tour de france alone as if i got there by myself i dont just show up there after almost three thousand miles and say look what i did when i wear the yellow jersey i figure i only deserve the zipper the rest of it each sleeve the front the back belongs to the guys
4750170 a great team is a mysterious thing hard to create much less duplicate and there are a lot more bad teams in the world than good ones just look around people talk about teamwork all the time its a shopworn and overused term experts try to explain and define it charlatans write books on the subject but few really understand it

4750181 lower a womans self esteem thus making her more vulnerable to your advances
4750182 an ambiguous statement or seemingly accidental insult delivered to a beautiful girl a pickup artist has just met with the act of actively demonstrating to her or her friends a lack of interest in her
4750183 well hes frilling up a lot and running round the viv
4750184 let him out maybe hes just got a bit hot
4750185 yes he seems to be now but he went mental when i let him out
4750186 well he just freaked out he was frilling right up at me and got really aggressive he tried to bite me and then rolled on his back to get away from me
4750187 yes hes asleep on the arm of the chair ive been stroking him
4750188 sounds as though hes over heated put him back in his viv and turn his spotlights and heater off leave him with just his uv and keep a very close eye on him i want you to do temp checks of all the vivs for me and ring me back with the readings
4750189 are you sure he wont be in any pain because i couldnt bear him to go through what he did last night

4750198 its like a three act play and were in the opening minutes of the second act
4750199 yes saudi intelligence chief prince muqrin bin abdul aziz did visit pakistan on friday and met senior government officials
4750200 the main purpose of the visit was to find an amicable solution to the musharraf impeachment issue and that no one should become a laughing stock
4750201 saudi arabia is a very strong ally of both pakistan and the us and the visit was a sincere and friendly effort to interact with all and sundry to settle the issue
4750202 the saudis have very strong bonds of friendship with us president pervez musharraf has also been very close to riyadh during his rule
4750203 president pervez musharraf has to take a decision about resignation by today or tomorrow as there is no room for any delay
4750204 if he fails to decide on tendering his resignation by today or tomorrow the process of impeachment will commence
4750205 hopefully the pressure has come off the people that compete tomorrow
4750206 just as we were on the water the pair was out there winning the gold
4750207 it was great to get on the water then because we were happy
4750208 it wasnt expected that wed get a medal because the olympics is such a huge event
4750209 at the end i was just saying keep it together
4750210 and it was almost embarrassing to do that but there wasnt anything left in the tank at least i held on today

4750216 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual any disruption by any athlete in particular a medallist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play

4750284 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4750285 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4750286 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4750287 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4750288 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4750289 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4750290 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4750291 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4750292 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4750293 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4750294 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4750295 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4750296 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4750297 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4750298 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4750299 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4750300 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4750301 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4750302 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4750303 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4750304 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4750305 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4750306 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4750307 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4750308 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4750309 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4750310 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4750311 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4750312 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4750313 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4750314 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4750315 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4750316 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4750317 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4750318 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4750319 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4750320 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4750321 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4750322 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4750323 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4750324 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4750325 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4750326 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4750327 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4750328 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4750329 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4750330 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4750331 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4750332 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4750333 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4750334 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4750335 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4750336 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4750337 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4750338 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4750339 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4750340 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

4750355 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4750356 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4750357 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4750358 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

4750363 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4750364 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4750365 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be

4750373 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about

4750396 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4750397 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4750398 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4750399 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4750400 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4750401 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4750402 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4750403 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4750404 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4750405 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4750406 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4750407 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4750408 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4750409 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4750410 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4750411 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4750412 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4750413 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4750414 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4750415 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4750416 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4750417 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4750418 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4750419 i will not condemn you for what you did yesterday if you do it right today
4750420 n j hvor ser du godt ud m jeg ikke tage dig med hjem som en f dselsdagsgave

4750422 observed gender differences may be indicative of different waking needs experiences desires and attitudes with respect to sexuality
4750423 this is consistent with the continuity hypothesis of dreaming which postulates that the content of everyday dreams reflects the dreamers waking states and concerns that is that dream and waking thought contents are continuous
4750424 we have killed nine militants and the operation is still continuing
4750425 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4750426 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4750427 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4750428 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4750429 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4750430 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4750431 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4750432 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4750433 should create a richer more perplexing experience taking your body through a journey of compression release and reflection
4750434 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4750435 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4750436 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4750437 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4750438 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4750439 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4750440 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4750441 who are open to doing something on the production side
4750442 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4750443 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4750444 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4750445 hon ansahs behaviour could lead to the party losing the seat to the opposition parties
4750446 in 2004 13 constituencies suffered the skirt and blouse syndrome and the development is likely to hit kwabre west constituency this year
4750447 we are giving the national executives of the npp and all who matter in the management of the party 10 days ultimatum to address the issue or we will advice ourselves
4750448 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4750449 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4750450 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4750451 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4750452 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4750453 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4750454 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4750455 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4750456 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4750457 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4750458 targeting premium consumers and a broader audience to elevate the hyundai brand
4750459 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4750460 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4750461 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4750462 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4750463 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4750464 consistent with the 20th century trend of rising average temperatures
4750465 illegal bird trapping in cyprus is an indiscriminate practice that threatens many protected bird species
4750466 a frank admission is that if this problem is not solved then the results would be awful as it is an aquatic system and can be sustained only when it gets replenishment of water
4750467 then they backpedaled later on when the veterinarian told him it was nowhere near nine years old
4750468 my neighbor asked for help i eventually took my parrot out of her cage and managed to get the owl into it i got the impression that it might have been someones pet
4750469 let no one deceive or despise another being whatever their status let no one by anger or hatred wish harm to another
4750470 interesting that it took a religious group to stand up to this while the secularits did nothing
4750471 oh look they arent going to help what horrible people they are

4750475 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4750476 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4750477 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap

4750507 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4750508 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4750509 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4750510 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama

4750514 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4750515 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4750516 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4750517 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4750518 dengan kata lain memindahkan kesadaran kita dari otak ke dalam hati
4750519 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4750520 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4750521 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4750522 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4750523 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4750524 he is the first senior uk politician to visit since violence erupted nearly two weeks ago and is due to meet georgias pm lado gurgenidze
4750525 it will raise questions as to why gordon brown or foreign secretary david miliband have not visited no10 said the pm on holiday in scotland spoke to president mikhail saakashvili last night
4750526 there is added lustre to david and samantha camerons summer break to turkey at the weekend the couple are flying to istanbul and will join other members of the family on a sailing holiday to celebrate the 60th birthday of sams mother viscountess astor

4750536 ieder jaar krijgen we dit soort gevallen binnen maar vier op een maand en telkens op dezelfde manier is toch opvallend

4750538 wij hebben onmiddellijk die rolpaden laten inspecteren maar er is niets mis mee
4750539 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4750540 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4750541 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4750542 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4750543 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4750544 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4750545 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4750546 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4750547 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4750548 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4750549 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4750550 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4750551 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4750552 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4750553 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4750554 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4750555 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4750556 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4750557 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4750558 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4750559 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4750560 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4750561 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4750562 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4750563 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4750564 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4750565 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4750566 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4750567 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4750568 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4750569 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4750570 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4750571 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4750572 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete

4750662 canadas first adult video channel offering significant canadian adult content
4750663 i didnt think it could be called canadian content at 15
4750664 one flavour of everything grows repetitive and tiresome after a while i dont know about you but im tired of seeing the silicon valley girls constantly different people like different things you cant keep serving them the same thing over and over and expect them to swallow it
4750665 were optimistic and were confident that well find a carrier
4750666 porn doesnt have the same stigma it did years ago its a legitimate business with legitimate business opportunities
4750667 theres an untapped well of canadian talent why wouldnt we use it why would we go fishing elsewhere
4750668 the channel means canadian producers will be a lot busier producing for the network the second thing is well get a lot more new talent its been flooded with the same girls same guys the same kinds of things for a long time
4750669 we know there are going to be naysayers but we know this is a business
4750670 we know we do it well we know theres quality and professionalism to it some people are always going to react oh youre hurting the children or whatever but this is going to be a subscription channel this is not going to be in anyones home who did not intentionally go out pursue it and wants it in their home were not forcing this down anyones throat
4750671 why its not a good idea to run a 5k on moving day and other tales of relocation
4750672 keep your eye on the ball get in front of it

4750678 effeminate men intrigue me more than anything in the world i see them as my alter egos i feel very drawn to them i think like a guy but im feminine so i relate to feminine men
4750679 sometimes you have to be a bitch to get things done
4750680 i am my own experiment i am my own work of art
4750681 this program is based on honesty and right now you arent being honest
4750682 i know really the bottom line is and i hate im saying this i dont want to stop
4750683 that thing in your head telling you this is wrong thats your god voice talking to you
4750684 and i will i promise when im ready to let go
4750685 of course there is crime in salisbury if it wasnt we would not need law enforcement i still do not believe our crime is as high as baltimores people can do anything they want with numbers a few days ago a lady in baltimore ask a person who lived on her street if he would move his car up a little so she could get out of her car he got out of his car shoved her when her husband came out to see what was happening the man shot him twice and killed him this incident is like an ever day occurance we do not have murder every day of the week like philadelphia how often does a bank get robbed how often is a child kidnapped or murdered my son in 1992 was murdered a block from where i was born i believe that our police department sheriffs department and state police are doing a great job as our city and county population increases we may see an increase in crime but the stats are on the salisbury police website shoplifting is one of the crimes that has been increasing due to more stores being open one thing that is missing is respect for older people and people in general young people today do not respect authority or even their parents when i was coming up i feared the police my pastor and teachers not today shane
4750686 estaba en shock al final fue como una especie de reacci n retardada no ten a idea de cuan pareja era la competencia sent a dolor en los ltimos 10 metros era mi ltima carrera individual y quer a terminarla lo m s fuerte posible
4750687 en realidad pens que con esa media brazada hab a perdido pero me imagino que hizo la diferencia al final
4750688 la palabra que me viene a la mente es pica lo que hizo esta noche fue pico nunca pens que estaba fuera de esa carrera phelps representa un tipo de fuente de inspiraci n para los j venes de todo el mundo
4750689 siempre me pregunt qu iba a decir en el momento en el que pasara esto y por supuesto yo ya sab a lo que le iba a decir a phelps desde hace alg n tiempo

4750691 melky has options and i have a young guy whos pushing his way into the mix in brett gardner
4750692 gardner has some things going for him excellent speed good range in the outfield some patience and the ability to hit for a respectable average the thing that will keep him on a major league bench as opposed to the starting lineup is a complete total absolute lack of power
4750693 the shakeup has to come from the guys who are expected to perform
4750694 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4750695 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4750696 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4750697 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4750698 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4750699 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4750700 i think rick is in an unenviable position in that he stands to get attacked from the right and the left based on what direction he takes
4750701 as an evangelical i am much more interested in his list of questions than in either of their answers
4750702 given the pattern of the thing its not unreasonable for people to ask
4750703 the media and a large chunk of the public including some of johns supporters still question whether hes told the whole truth
4750704 happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
4750705 i feel sorry for his family because how horrible but also dont you think he is the father of the child
4750706 anybody whos been around campaigns knows that folks come and go
4750707 i would only have positive things to say about him as being a helpful friendly and pleasant co worker to a new employee
4750708 they seemed to be crazy about each other they certainly are crazy about their kids and dog

4750712 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence
4750713 had no knowledge of the suit he did not authorize the suit or participate in its filing
4750714 you can be sure that i talked to and got the permission of any client who is listed as a plaintiff
4750715 i dont think it took more than 15 minutes of his time
4750716 the fact that they dont remember it doesnt bother me
4750717 plaintiffs lawyers will routinely ask for significant damages to try and prompt a settlement
4750718 what possible difference could it make it was all 25 years ago

4750740 if you could choose between true love and 1 000 000 what would it be money comes and money goes true love is forever
4750741 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
4750742 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
4750743 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
4750744 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
4750745 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
4750746 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
4750747 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
4750748 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
4750749 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
4750750 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
4750751 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
4750752 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
4750753 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
4750754 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
4750755 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
4750756 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others

4750759 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it
4750760 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4750761 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4750762 i guess its safe to say ive played my last game in a bulls uniform
4750763 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4750764 we tried some things during practice that didnt work at all
4750765 so we went back to where we were and i think thats one of the best qualifying cars ive ever had it was a heck of a lap
4750766 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual any disruption by any athlete in particular a medallist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play
4750767 it should be noted that in front of the disciplinary commission the athlete never expressed any regret nor did he offer any apology for his actions
4750768 it was a great journey we met some lovely people and visited some fab places but nothing beats home needless to say we are looking forward to a warm shower some good grub and our own beds

4750800 a fast word about oral contraception i asked a girl to go to bed with me she said no

4750803 i am thankful for laughter except when milk comes out of my nose
4750804 if you want to make god laugh tell him about your plans
4750805 the talent for being happy is appreciating and liking what you have instead of what you dont have

4750817 well what do you expect when you watch fox news
4750818 finally when the moderator would get around to asking dr paul a question it was a unique one sided question engineered to make dr paul foolish
4750819 so it would have been impossible for ron paul supporters to vote multiple times i must be forgetting some law that says you can only have one cell phone
4750820 ron paul is a fringe candidate i suspect even he does not take his candidacy seriously if what he has to say resonates with voters he will get their support
4750821 the reason fox has the highest viewership is due to puppets such as yourself who actually believe the tainted stories that come from this network the problem with most people is that they choose not to educate themselves on the facts
4750822 a top manager will always make a difference and weve got a top manager again a world cup winner and a great football man
4750823 tactically he is very aware and when he talks everyone listens he has that aura about him
4750824 he doesnt speak very often but when he does he gets the attention of everyone we needed that
4750825 he also has that fear factor we havent really seen that side of him yet but im sure we will
4750826 and when he occasionally raises his voice you think oh there it is
4750827 he also likes to have a joke and a laugh he has that charisma mourinho had
4750828 the president informed participants of the security council meeting that he had just now signed the six point plan
4750829 russian forces need to leave georgia at once this is no longer 1968

4750839 he was a loveable lad who was never really in trouble
4750840 he was respectful but there had been trouble at this party
4750841 someone told me that connor was thought to have said something to someone which he denied
4750842 it all then got out of hand and there was a commotion and he ended up getting stabbed
4750843 he wasnt the sort of lad who would look for trouble but he would back himself up
4750844 he was a really good lad i cant believe this has happened
4750845 he had everything to live for and was a normal young lad into football all his friends are stunned

4750851 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4750852 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4750853 im so proud of what hes been able to do
4750854 they examined the video and i think the case is closed

4750856 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4750857 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4750858 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4750859 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4750860 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4750861 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4750862 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4750863 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more

4750867 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too
4750868 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4750869 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race

4750875 oh adhere to me for we are bound by symmetry and whatever differences our lives have been we together make a limb
4750876 the president informed participants of the security council meeting that he had just now signed the six point plan
4750877 a la rentr e il faudrait peut tre que lon se retrouve tous autour de la table pour discuter du probl me nous travaillons d j avec test achats sur une loi qui offrirait la possibilit aux personnes dup es dentamer des actions judiciaires
4750878 ik houd helemaal niet van protesten en zeker niet op heel belangrijke toernooien zoals hier ik ben dolblij dat we er nu vanaf zijn het zilver dat we maandag gaan winnen zal voor ons een gouden randje hebben
4750879 youve probably heard how expensive those new lzr costumes are about 200 a go
4750880 coming into this meet nobody wanted to speak to me i was miss nobody
4750881 its going to be a steep learning curve for her getting used to this attention but i think the penny dropped when we came out to that crush
4750882 but she will handle it shes a mansfield girl and a pretty amazing one too shell keep her feet on the ground
4750883 i could just hear them all shouting i could hear simon burnett yell i want your babies which i am sure his girlfriend would have something to say about as well as my boyfriend
4750884 it is just so inspiring going to london in four years time it is a long way away off and will mean a lot of hard work but it gives youre the inspiration to do it when becky can just go out there and smash the world record to win her second gold
4750885 i have had the privilege of seeing her train every day and i know what she puts herself through and how tough she is
4750886 i saw how upset she was after last years world championships but to be honest i believe of she had not had that disappointment she might not have done this now because it made her a stronger person
4750887 she was bawling her eyes out she was so upset
4750888 so that was the only question mark over becky there was no doubting her talent or her hard work but could she do it at a major championship
4750889 i learnt a lot about myself that day i had trained so hard no less hard than i have been this year but it was my first major meet and i was a bit out of my depth to be honest
4750890 i got out of the pool after failing to make the final and i was distraught i was in tears i have never been so upset i swore then that i was never going to let that happen again that i was not going to be getting out of the olympic pool crying my eyes out
4750891 it was a really testing time for the family and to be honest a lot of people were questioning whether she could come back from that
4750892 mum has given so much for me she is the one who is always there to ferry me around to make sure things are right my dad helps me financially but my mum is basically my manager
4750893 i thought oh no maybe theyve have missed my gold so in the 800m i just wanted so much to do it for them
4750894 at about 500m i breathed and happened to look up and i saw my mum in the crowd with the union jack i wasnt looking for them it was just luck and i thought ive got to do it for them
4750895 the prospect of another four years of such hard work feels a bit daunting right now but i am going to have a good few months off which will help but my body is developing i am more muscley than i was last year so i am getting stronger it is early days now but i may focus more on the 200m and the 400m as the training for the 800m is such hard work
4750896 el presidente inform a los participantes en la reuni n del consejo de seguridad cs de rusia que acababa de firmar el plan de arreglo que consta de seis principios
4750897 el plan no prev un nuevo estatus pol tico de abjasia y osetia del sur pues su contexto se basa en las resoluciones del consejo de seguridad de la onu que reconocen la integridad territorial de georgia
4750898 with the signature of the georgian president on this ceasefire accord all russian troops and any irregular or paramilitary forces that entered with them must leave immediately
4750899 this is the understanding i had with president sarkozy yesterday that when president saakashvili signed this ceasefire accord there would be an immediate withdrawal of russian forces from georgian territory
4750900 we told the world this is about starting an invasion
4750901 its an unprovoked brutal invasion and attack to kill georgian democracy and end the independence of georgia and we together will deter it
4750902 russia has lots of tanks but russia no tank is enough to crush the will of the free people freedoms light will never die here
4750903 to act in such a way as will enable any order the court may take to have its appropriate effects
4750904 the united states does carry some weight in this part of the world because georgia wants very much to become a member of nato and according to diplomats we spoke to here that seems to be the crux of the problem
4750905 georgia has its nato aspirations and these are aspirations russia is going to do its best to try to quell
4750906 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4750907 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4750908 the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias
4750909 i am deeply concerned by the notion that russia has a say or some control over a country outside of its border
4750910 i am deeply concerned by the notion that the united states has a say or some control over a country outside of its border
4750911 the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4750912 what people should really be worrying about is natos inclusion of poland and the recent decision to put missile bases on their soil now thats something bush has been pushing for sometime now against russias wishes
4750913 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4750914 the saakashvili government has not invaded or attacked five of its neighbours it has not started two major wars or caused the death of millions of people it has not hosted or sponsored nearly every major international terrorist group it has not defied 17 resolutions of the security council each one backed by the threat of force it has not corrupted a united nations sanctions regime nor blocked its arms inspectors nor bribed high officials in member states it has not developed or tried to chemical biological and nuclear weapons nor has it used them on its own or other countries citizens it is not a bestial dictatorship whose people would be only too happy to see it gone it is in fact a popularly elected pro western democratic government imperfect as democracies go but a paragon by the standards of the region certainly when compared to the medvedev putin thugocracy that runs russia
4750915 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers we will of course respond in just the same way we have responded there should be no doubt about this
4750916 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely that the ossetians and the abkhazians will be able to live in one state together with the georgians
4750917 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4750918 by hosting these poland is making itself a target this is 100 percent
4750919 it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4750920 all i see when i look into putins eyes is k g b
4750921 this isnt the way to deal with problems in the 21st century

4750924 the president informed participants of the security council meeting that he had just now signed the six point plan
4750925 by deploying poland is exposing itself to a strike 100
4750926 it is rare that all the blame is on one side in fact both sides are probably to blame that is very important to understand
4750927 profound implications for russia this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4750928 you cant be a responsible member of institutions which are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours
4750929 russia has every time been testing the reaction of the west its going to replicate what happened in georgia elsewhere
4750930 we are looking evil directly in the eye today this evil is very strong and very dangerous for everybody not just for us
4750931 georgia has been attacked russian forces need to leave georgia at once
4750932 must take place and take place now this is no longer 1968
4750933 our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone
4750934 but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except russian peacekeepers
4750935 this clearly demonstrates the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has as its aim the russian federation
4750936 this is a good time to come to the emirates
4750937 dont arsenal have to win something this season otherwise theyll be footballs equivalent of those girls who walk on the with the darts players a lot better to look at than the main attractions but not actually involved in what matters
4750938 you have to have a belief going to arsenal that you can win otherwise why bother turning up
4750939 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4750940 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4750941 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4750942 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4750943 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4750944 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4750945 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4750946 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4750947 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4750948 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4750949 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4750950 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4750951 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4750952 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4750953 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4750954 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4750955 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4750956 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4750957 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4750958 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4750959 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4750960 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4750961 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4750962 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4750963 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4750964 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4750965 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4750966 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4750967 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4750968 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4750969 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4750970 i have to see if my boss will approve this deal
4750971 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4750972 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4750973 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4750974 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4750975 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4750976 we make our own decisions about what we consider newsworthy
4750977 the nomination of the first african american presidential nominee after a bitter primary campaign and his efforts to unite a party afterward were simply more newsworthy than a candidate whose nomination was already assured and who spent much of that time raising money in the end we can and should be judged on the fairness of our coverage but that is a judgment that must be made over the course of the whole campaign not a single period of time
4750978 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
4750979 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo
4750980 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4750981 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4750982 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4750983 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4750984 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4750985 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4750986 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4750987 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4750988 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4750989 it indicates to us that our fundraising continues to be very healthy
4750990 so well be spending much more than weve been raising
4750991 john mccains decision to raise money from one of the key figures in the jack abramoff scandal one of abramoffs conspirators in a money laundering scheme is a very disappointing example of john mccain abandoning his principles on the campaign trail
4750992 he claimed to be a reformer well reformer no more
4750993 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4750994 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro

4751003 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4751004 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4751005 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

4751018 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4751019 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4751020 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4751034 republicans are too scared to go home to face their constituents after voting against bills to force big oil companies to use it or lose it demand that the president free our oil from the government stockpile and crack down on speculators

4751053 so we have to deliver unique experiences to our customers
4751054 yes but its more than that a powerful brand delivers moments moments that we want to re live again and again
4751055 you have to understand most people lead lives of quiet desperation people are bored out of their minds
4751056 so if we can deliver moments theyll want to do business with us again and again
4751057 thats right and why do you think celebrities and athletes get paid so much money because theyre famous no because they entertain us thats part of it because they deliver moments to us they deliver excitement to us the amaze us they startle us they move us they make us cry they make us laugh they make us think most importantly they make us dream
4751058 so if you really think about it youre not selling a product youre not selling a service ultimately what were all selling is good feelings

4751247 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4751248 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4751249 the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias
4751250 i am deeply concerned by the notion that russia has a say or some control over a country outside of its border
4751251 i am deeply concerned by the notion that the united states has a say or some control over a country outside of its border
4751252 the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4751253 what people should really be worrying about is natos inclusion of poland and the recent decision to put missile bases on their soil now thats something bush has been pushing for sometime now against russias wishes
4751254 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4751255 the saakashvili government has not invaded or attacked five of its neighbours it has not started two major wars or caused the death of millions of people it has not hosted or sponsored nearly every major international terrorist group it has not defied 17 resolutions of the security council each one backed by the threat of force it has not corrupted a united nations sanctions regime nor blocked its arms inspectors nor bribed high officials in member states it has not developed or tried to chemical biological and nuclear weapons nor has it used them on its own or other countries citizens it is not a bestial dictatorship whose people would be only too happy to see it gone it is in fact a popularly elected pro western democratic government imperfect as democracies go but a paragon by the standards of the region certainly when compared to the medvedev putin thugocracy that runs russia
4751256 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers we will of course respond in just the same way we have responded there should be no doubt about this
4751257 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely that the ossetians and the abkhazians will be able to live in one state together with the georgians
4751258 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4751259 by hosting these poland is making itself a target this is 100 percent
4751260 it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4751261 all i see when i look into putins eyes is k g b
4751262 this isnt the way to deal with problems in the 21st century
4751263 i feel the player loses value if he is not eligible for the champions league you cannot sell a player at the same price every club will consider that i have a shortlist but the list was always short
4751264 we feel we were a fraction short last year by not much
4751265 we want to show we can get the four points which made the difference last year between us and the winner
4751266 of course we have lost some players but we have also brought some players we opted for some stability
4751267 lets focus on the short term goals and lets show later on weve learned from when we dropped off last season
4751268 restore brilliance to your jewelry with tap water and 42 000 energy waves of frequency cleaner is also safe for cleaning eyeglasses and dentures it even includes a cd dvd holder watch stand and jewelry cleaning basket features digital display with five timed cycles from 90 to 400 seconds

4751278 why one set of reasons for holding certain values is regarded as automatically validating these values in the public square and the other set of reasons as necessarily invalidating the values based on them
4751279 treatment of advanced cancer that is meant to prolong life or change the course of this disease is not a covered benefit
4751280 would cover palliative or comfort care including if she chose doctor assisted suicide
4751281 to say to someone well pay for you to die but not pay for you to live its cruel
4751282 how could they not pay for medication that would help my life and yet offer to pay to end my life
4751283 it absolutely conveys to the patient that continued living isnt worthwhile it corrupts the consistent medical ethic that has been in place for 2 000 years
4751284 im not sure how we can lift that the reality is at some level doctor assisted suicide could be considered as a palliative or comfort care measure we had no intent to upset barbara wagner but we do need to point out the options available to her under the oregon health plan
4751285 it is not by accident that bill c 38 the canadian legislation on same sex marriage and its consequential amendments dismantles the language of natural parent blood relationship and the like language that acknowledges implicitly the priority of the family to the state in favor of terms such as legal parent and legal parent child relationship
4751286 has effectively made every man woman and child a chattel of the state by turning their most fundamental human connections into mere legal constructs at the states disposal
4751287 a voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others
4751288 marriage is the union of a man and a woman a consortium for the whole of life involving the communication of divine and human rights
4751289 civil marriage and religious marriage as if they referred to two different things rather than to two different ways of enacting the same thing
4751290 that religious marriage can have no public significance and that civil marriage need not concern itself with any religious truth even with the truth of natural law
4751291 redemptive state a state convinced that its proper purpose is to improve its subjects by imprinting on them on their projects and character the values that the state has made its own and declared superior

4751295 running for office candidates campaigns and the cartoons of clifford berryman
4751296 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4751297 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4751298 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4751299 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4751300 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4751301 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4751302 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4751303 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4751304 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4751305 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4751306 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4751307 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4751308 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4751309 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4751310 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4751311 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4751312 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4751313 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4751314 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4751315 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4751316 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4751317 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4751318 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4751319 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4751320 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4751321 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4751322 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4751323 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4751324 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4751325 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4751326 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4751327 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4751328 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4751329 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4751330 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4751331 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4751332 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4751333 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4751334 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4751335 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4751336 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4751337 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4751338 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4751339 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4751340 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4751341 well if crime fighters fight crime and fire fighters fight fire what do freedom fighters fight they never mention that part to us do they
4751342 cake bowl made of twisted paper morimasa takei made this cake bowl of twisted paper as a loyalist of the meiji restoration he was arrested by the himeji feudal clan he stocked the tissue paper given to him in prison and with it he secretly made the twisted papers on the underside of the lid of the cake bowl he wrote a poem to mourn the death of other loyalists
4751343 a memorial to the spirit that protected himeji castle from losing battles
4751344 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4751345 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4751346 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4751347 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4751348 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4751349 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4751350 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4751351 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4751352 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4751353 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4751354 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4751355 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4751356 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4751357 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4751358 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4751359 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4751360 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4751361 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4751362 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4751363 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4751364 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4751365 hillary doesnt hate senator obama she wants him to win i really believe that and you know ive always said fox did the fairest job covering this but i think this is basically media hype

4751367 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4751368 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4751369 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4751370 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4751371 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
4751372 if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4751373 daar in dat kasteel is de mooiste dame van dit land en haar naam is vrouwe elaine ook hebben wij in dit kasteel n van de knapste ridders en de machtigste man die er is durf ik zeggen en hij noemt zichzelf le chevalier malfait
4751374 hij kwam in dit land als een gek en jongens en honden joegen hem door de stad van corbyn en door het gewijde vat de heilige graal werd hij weer bij zijn verstand gebracht maar hij wil geen slag leveren tegen een ridder behalve met midmorgen of met noen maar als u in het kasteel wilt moet u naar de andere kant van het kasteel rijden en daar zult u een schuit vinden die u en uw paard over zal varen
4751375 u zult hier op mij wachten tot ik weet wat voor ridder hij is want het zou schande voor ons zijn omdat het maar n ridder is om beiden slag met hem te leveren
4751376 ga naar de goede ridder van dit kasteel en zeg hem dat er een dolende ridder is die de lans met hem wil vellen
4751377 waar het steekspel zal zijn en de dames en heren u kunnen aanschouwen
4751378 bij uw ridderschap vraag ik u mij uw naam te zeggen want zo een ridder ontmoette ik nog nooit
4751379 die zal ik niet voor u verbergen want mijn naam is le chevalier malfait zeg mij nu uw naam verzoek ik u
4751380 mijn naam is sir percival van galis en mijn broeder was de goede ridder sir lamorak van galis en koning pellinor was onze vader en sir aglovale is mijn broeder
4751381 wat heb ik gedaan met u te vechten die een ridder van de ronde tafel zijt want eens was ik uw genoot
4751382 waarde ridder wie u ook bent bij uw ridderschap vraag ik u mij uw ware naam te zeggen
4751383 zo helpe mij god mijn naam is sir lancelot du lac koning bans zoon van benwick
4751384 wat heb ik nu gedaan want ik ben door de koningin gezonden om u te zoeken en dus heb ik u bijna twee jaar gezocht en ginds is sir ector de maris uw broeder die op mij wacht aan de andere kant van het water en daarom om gods wil
4751385 hier is mijn zoon elijn de blanke en daar dat zo is wil ik dat u weet dat ik hem mee zal nemen naar het hof van koning arthur
4751386 u mag hem meenemen maar hij is nog zeer pril van jaren
4751387 toch zal ik hem meenemen en hem naar het roemrijkste huis van de wereld brengen
4751388 dat kan ik onder geen beding doen want het hof werd mij zo hatelijk verboden dat ik mij heb voorgenomen daar nooit meer te komen
4751389 ik ben uw broeder en u bent de man waarvan ik op deze wereld het meeste houd en als ik wist dat het u tot oneer was dan begrijpt u wel dat ik het u nooit zou raden maar koning arthur en al zijn ridders en koningin gwenivere in het bijzonder hebben zoveel treurnis en verdriet om u dat het een wonder is om te horen en te zien en u moet uw grote roem en vermaardheid gedenken en dat er meer over u is gesproken dan over enige andere ridder die thans leeft want er is niemand die de naam heeft dan u en sir tristram en daarom broeder
4751390 maak u gereed om met ons naar het hof te rijden want ik durf te zeggen en het hard te maken dat het zoeken naar u mijn vrouwe de koningin twintigduizend pond heeft gekost
4751391 het komende pinksterfeest zal uw en mijn zoon galahad ridder worden gemaakt want hij telt nu vijftien volle winters
4751392 en god geve hem de genade een goede ridder te worden
4751393 ik twijfel niet of hij zal de beste man van zijn geslacht worden op n na

4751403 russia has become more aggressive toward the now democratic nations that broke free of the old soviet empire
4751404 russia also holds vast petroleum wealth and this heavy influence in the oil and gas market has become a strategic weapon that russia is clearly prepared to use

4751442 ojal nos tengan confianza nos gusta saber que tenemos el pueblo apoy ndonos
4751443 ganamos pero no tuvimos un gran partido ir n nos encest 82 puntos
4751444 no tuvimos una buena defensa realmente el partido contra croacia el jueves s que jugamos bien pero hoy no tanto
4751445 va a ser dificil simo quedarnos con el oro porque hay rivales demasiado fuertes pero ya conseguimos el primer objetivo que era la clasificaci n a los cuartos de finales
4751446 no sent que ten a que tomar el control del partido ni nada parecido lo que sucedi fue que encest un par de tiros buenos y segu confiado
4751447 esperamos jugar en un buen nivel el resto del camino para traer otra medalla para el pa s
4751448 no todo el mundo puede darse el lujo de decir que ha representado a su pa s dos veces en unos juegos ol mpicos y eso me hace sentir muy bien realmente
4751449 todav a no est definido pero lo m s probable es que enfrentemos a grecia que es un equipo joven con mucha fuerza y que juega una defensa impresionante
4751450 my sisters scout and talullah had cute nicknames when i was 12 and had crushes on guys id put my first name with their last name but it never sounded right rumer depp nope in school kids would sing rumer rumer with a big hairy tumour
4751451 its shocking how unbelievably mean people are not just the people who are writing stuff the people who make comments for awhile i read that stuff and it was upsetting id get really down on myself which is debilitating
4751452 now i think do you really have nothing better to do than talk s t about me
4751453 if people call me a lesbian because i have short hair and i wear jeans instead of dresses then by all means run with it i think its hilarious i like guys
4751454 sure i have my issues but im not in rehab im not in crazy debt i like the fact that i didnt just get my ged but i graduated from high school a lot of it has to do with my parents they have a desire to keep us kids grounded and give us a normal upbringing
4751455 airborne however when used as directed does not prevent class action lawsuits charges of deceptive advertising or according to the government the common cold
4751456 there is no credible evidence that airborne products will reduce the severity or duration of colds or provide any tangible benefit for people who are exposed to germs in crowded places
4751457 we have killed nine militants and the operation is still continuing
4751458 the developed and super wealthy the developing nations the emerging economies and the least developed countries
4751459 for all its symbolism and significance as the one occasion when the globe truly partakes of an all embracing event promoting the loftiest ideals of civilisation
4751460 as for now our planet is not one world sharing one dream
4751461 the 2008 edition in this regard must stand out as one of the most if not the real controversial olympics
4751462 should have been the scale when bestowing such an honour on any country
4751463 the 2008 olympics will go down in the history books not as the games at which many sports records were broken but as the first climate change olympics
4751464 despite reservations as a result of these and numerous other shortcomings the world has not embarrassed china out of respect of its huge importance in the global scheme of things and as the honourable thing to do by the great peoples of china
4751465 its good to see that the ticket sales have gone extremely well because they play their part
4751466 its quite a remarkable story that were on course for record sales considering where the club was in 1995 when dave whelan took over as chairman to be in your fourth year in the premier league nearly 15 years later is fantastic to see
4751467 we always hope for a few more supporters and if we can keep doing the stuff on the pitch it gives you that feel good factor
4751468 the premier league is as tough now as its ever been
4751469 clubs have had huge outlays to put a team on the pitch and thats why its the best and the toughest league in the world
4751470 so if we can improve on last season finish above 14th and push towards the top 10 that would be a marvellous achievement
4751471 i think everybody here at wigan is trying to keep their feet on the ground because after all i believe were playing in the best league in the world
4751472 but were delighted with what weve done over the summer and we think the squad is stronger
4751473 we finished the season off fantastically well and if you look at the teams in there it was a remarkable run

4751484 there has been no problem his progress has been great he has never missed a session morning or afternoon we are pencilling him in for the beginning of october
4751485 the next three weeks he will have rehab and then the next part will be endurance work and serious running before he goes into the football side with us
4751486 improvement can come in different ways for ronaldo this season 42 goals is a target it is still possible for him to achieve that given the talent of the boy and his goalscoring ability but you have to say it is a big target

4751496 t he day will come when unpleasant things are going to happen to a bunch of stupid liberals and its going to be very amusing to watch
4751497 howard dean should be arrested and hung for treason or put in a hole until the end of the iraq war

4751499 us ambassador to the philippines kristie kenney is blatantly lying by claiming that she was merely invited to witness the aborted signing of the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain he said in a statement e mailed from the netherlands where he lives in exile
4751500 contrary to her claim the ambassador has frequently traveled to mindanao to oversee us interests there including investments military forces and
4751501 steer the course for grp milf peace negotiations for the sake of us interests he added
4751502 the filipino people know that the us covets the oil and other natural resources of mindanao and wants to establish us military bases there to protect us imperial interests he said
4751503 ive made very clear i think why we are interested in peace in mindanao its good for security its good for economic activity she said
4751504 the usip is funded by the us congress and is an instrument of us foreign policy but it misrepresents itself as an independent and nonpartisan institution he said pointing that its ex officio members include secretary of state condoleezza rice and secretary of defense robert gates
4751505 the us is not interested in a just and lasting peace in either bangsamoro land or in the entire philippines it is interested solely or mainly in advancing us interests amidst conditions of armed conflict he said
4751506 it merely pretends to facilitate the grp milf peace negotiations when its sees big advantages in doing so he added

4751514 no one has been a better companion to me than abu bakr
4751515 i called people to islam everybody thought over it at least for a while but this was not the case with abu bakr the moment i put islam before him he accepted it without any hesitation
4751516 i have been looking forward to this day for months
4751517 if that hand touches the beard of the prophet again it will not be allowed to go back
4751518 this is not abu bakrs voice none but he should lead prayers he is the fittest person for this position
4751519 if anyone says that the messenger of allah is dead i will cut off his head
4751520 muhammad is only a messenger of allah there have been messengers before him what then will you turn back from islam if he dies or is killed
4751521 both done great service to islam but the former were the first to accept islam they were always very close to the messenger of allah let the khalifa be from amongst them
4751522 o siddique how can that be how can anyone else fill this position as long as you are among us you are the best person from the muhajirun you were the companion of the prophet saw in the thawr cave you led prayers in his place during his last illness prayer is the foremost thing in islam with all these qualifications you are the fittest person to be the successor of the holy prophet hold out your hand that we may pledge loyalty to you

4751526 heathrow does not compete with gatwick and with stansted or with luton or manchester
4751527 it competes with charles de gaulle paris it competes with dubai now and with schiphol amsterdam because these are big international hub airports so the ownership of these airports actually has nothing to do with competition
4751528 i think there is a mood in the country that just wants the business broken up but i think the competition issue actually doesnt wash
4751529 we will fully support the break up frankly it is about time
4751530 monopolies do not help consumers ever it was almost as if baa had won the lottery without doing anything they have been in a position where essentially they could control how we travel
4751531 virgin atlantic will be looking very closely at whether it is sensible for a consortium of airlines to potentially own gatwick it may make sense because airlines know how to deliver to consumers
4751532 the key factor is that the airports develop in a way that best meets customers needs structure is secondary to ensuring that customers get what they want
4751533 weve been calling for the break up for a long time and the need has escalated every year

4751571 we can all identify with this question because sometimes we wish
4751572 later in the new testament paul explains it as jesus being the image of the invisible god james stuart the famed scottish theologian spoke of the paradoxical excellence of christ and divine personality

4751589 even in 2005 interest in the apac region was driven primarily by opportunistic servicing of growing domestic consulting demand in each market and the wish to support global clients in their endeavors in asia pacific
4751590 today a much larger group of firms has moved toward an overall strategic interest in the apac region such interest is unsurprising for the it consulting space since offshore outsourcing links have already been playing an important role in that area more surprising is how strategic interest is very quickly coming to play across the whole consulting landscape

4751653 ini melibatkan hal orang islam jadi termaktub dalam peruntukan perlembagaan perkara 121 1 a
4751654 pandangan kami pas jelas perkara ini tuduhan liwat perlu dirujuk mengikut hukum qazaf tuduhan fitnah yang memerlukan empat orang saksi atau berikrar bagi kedua dua pihak

4751661 we have tried to explain to them that this is a bad year and growers will not be happy with their move but they have harassed the management to an extent that it gave in to their demands
4751662 we have a lot of problems as tea farmers and it is surprising that our directors can at this time sit down and plot how they will spend the little money that should go to the grower
4751663 we want to first of all declare the second payment rates bonus before the directors can go for the trip otherwise it will raise a lot of questions
4751664 the ktda should not say their hands are tied since the directors are not signatories of any bank accounts they can only go with the money given to them by the management

4751701 ich hatte einen guten start aber auch das problem mit dem lenkrad deswegen war auch der start schwierig als ich anfuhr dr ckte mich die beschleunigung in den sitz und ich habe das lenkrad leicht abgezogen f r den rest des rennens musste ich mich immer wieder selbst daran erinnern das lenkrad festzudr cken
4751702 das war ein schwieriges rennen der start war noch okay und ich habe berlegt vervisch au en zu berholen das risiko war mir dann aber zu hoch und ich habe mich eingereiht dann hatte ich einen harten kampf mit cecotto der f r mich schwierig war weil mein auto wohl kein optimales set up hatte
4751703 ich habe schon am start gesehen dass sich cecotto etwas fr h bewegt hat in der ersten kurve hatte ich einen zweikampf mit chinosi ich war innen er hat die t r zugeschlagen und ist nach der unvermeidlichen ber hrung leider abgeflogen die strecke war sehr dreckig und die reifen haben schnell abgebaut so konnte ich mich nicht so lange im windschatten von vanthoor aufhalten und bin auf meiner position geblieben

4751754 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can engage the work to achieve national healing and reconciliation
4751755 a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country

4751811 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
4751812 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
4751813 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
4751814 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
4751815 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
4751816 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
4751817 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
4751818 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
4751819 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
4751820 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
4751821 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
4751822 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
4751823 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
4751824 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
4751825 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
4751826 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
4751827 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
4751828 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
4751829 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions

4751836 russia has every time been testing the reaction of the west its going to replicate what happened in georgia elsewhere
4751837 we are looking evil directly in the eye today this evil is very strong and very dangerous for everybody not just for us
4751838 georgia has been attacked russian forces need to leave georgia at once
4751839 must take place and take place now this is no longer 1968
4751840 our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone
4751841 but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except russian peacekeepers

4751866 kesejahteraan dilimpahkan atas kalian berbahagialah kalian maka masukilah surga ini sedang kalian kekal di dalamnya
4751867 yaitu surga aden yang pintu pintunya terbuka bagi mereka di dalamnya mereka bertelekan di atas dipan dipan sambil meminta buah buahan yang banyak dan minuman di surga tersebut
4751868 di surga terdapat delapan pintu ada pintu yang namanya ar rayyan yang hanya dimasuki oleh orang orang yang puasa
4751869 barang siapa yang berinfak dengan sepasang unta atau kuda atau lainnya di jalan allah swt
4751870 siapa di antara kalian yang berwudhu kemudian menyempurnakan wudhunya lalu membaca asyhadu an laa ilaaha illallahu wahdahulaa syarikalahu wa asyhadu anna muhammadan abduhu warasuluhu maka dibukakan baginya pintu pintu surga yang berjumlah delapan dan ia masuk dari mana saja yang ia sukai
4751871 jika seorang muslim mempunyai tiga orang anak yang belum baligh kemudian meninggal dunia maka mereka menjumpainya di pintu pintu surga yang delapan dan ia bebas masuk dari pintu mana saja yang ia sukai
4751872 demi muhammad yang jiwanya ada di tangan nya jarak antara dua daun pintu surga adalah seperti makkah dan hajar atau hajar dan makkah
4751873 kalian adalah penyempurna tujuh puluh umat kalian adalah umat yang terbaik dan termulia di sisi allah jarak di antara dua daun pintu surga adalah empat puluh tahun pada suatu hari ia akan penuh sesak
4751874 pintu yang dimasuki oleh penghuni surga jaraknya adalah sejauh perjalanan pengembara dunia yang ahli tiga kali lipat kemudian penghuni surga memenuhinya hingga pundak mereka nyaris lengkap
4751875 pergilah dan ucapkan salam kepada sekumpulan tersebut mereka adalah para malaikat yang sedang duduk duduk dan mendengarkan salam yang mereka sampaikan kepadamu karena salam tersebut adalah salammu dan salam anak keturunanmu

4751877 penghuni surga masuk ke dalam surga dengan rambut pendek belum berjenggot matanya bercelak dan usianya tiga puluh tiga tahun
4751878 jika penghuni surga meninggal dunia baik pada saat kecil atau tua maka mereka dikembalikan dengan usia tiga puluh tahun di surga dan usianya tidak bertambah selama lamanya begitu juga penghuni neraka
4751879 penghuni surga masuk surga dengan ketinggian adam enam puluh hasta dengan ukuran orang besar dengan wajah tampan setampan nabi yusuf seusia nabi isa tiga puluh tiga tahun lidahnya fasih sefasih nabi muhammad belum berjenggot dan berambut pendek
4751880 sesungguhnya derajat penghuni surga yang paling rendah yang berada di tingkat keenam dan ketujuh disediakan baginya tiga ratus pelayan yang setiap pagi dan sore melayaninya dengan memberikan tiga ratus piring yang saya ketahui piring tersebut terbuat dari emas
4751881 setiap piring mempunyai warna tersendiri yang tidak dimiliki oleh piring yang lain ia menikmati dari piring yang pertama hingga piring terakhir pelayan pelayan juga memberikan tiga ratus minuman di mana setiap minuman mempunyai warna tersendiri yang tidak dimiliki oleh tempat minum yang lain ia menikmati tempat minum pertama hingga tempat minum terakhir
4751882 sesungguhnya ia mempunyai istri sebanyak tujuh puluh dua orang yang berasal dari wanita wanita surgawi yang matanya cantik jelita belum temasuk istri istrinya dari wanita dunia
4751883 wajah wajah orang orang mukmin pada saat itu berseri seri kepada rabbnyalah mereka melihat
4751884 saya memang diperintah agar pintu surga ini tidak saya buka sebelum anda terlebih dulu masuk
4751885 jibril datang kepada saya dan memberi informasi tentang pintu surga yang akan dimasuki oleh umatku
4751886 ya rasulullah saw aku ingin bersamamu hingga dapat melihat pintu surga
4751887 engkau wahai abu bakar adalah orang pertama dari umatku yang memasuki surga
4751888 mereka berbaris dalam satu regu wajah mereka memancarkan kepuasan seperti rembulan saat pertama tubuh mereka bersih dari kotoran tidak meludah tidak berdahak dan tidak pula buang air tempat tempat singgahnya terbuat dari emas sisirnya terbuat juga dari emas dan perak tempat apinya adalah kayud keringatnya berupa minyak misyk setiap lelaki memiliki pasangan istri yang kulitnya cemerlang seolah olah sumsumnya tampak dari balik daging mereka tidak pernah berselisih tidak saling membenci sebab mereka sehati bacaannya tiap kali adalah tasbih setiap pagi maupun sore
4751889 pasti masuk surga di antara umatku yang berjumlah tujuh puluh ribu orang tanpa hisab atau tujuh ratus ribu orang mereka saling bergandeng hingga masuk surga semuanya wajah mereka seperti rembulan pada saat pertama
4751890 semua umat diperlihatkan kepadaku kemudian aku lihat ada nabi yang diikuti oleh sekelompok orang pengikutnya
4751891 ini adalah umatmu dan di antara mereka ada tujuh puluh ribu orang yang masuk surga tanpa dihisab dan disiksa
4751892 sementara orang orang sibuk membicarakan siapa sebenarnya mereka yang masuk ke dalam surga tanpa hisab dan tanpa disiksa
4751893 barangkali mereka adalah yang dilahirkan dalam keadaan islam dan tidak menyekutukan allah dengan sesuatupun
4751894 berdoalah kepada allah agar ia menjadikan aku di antara mereka
4751895 aku tahu orang terakhir yang ke luar dari neraka dan terakhir masuk surga ia ke luar dari neraka sambil merangkak lalu allah berfirman kepadanya
4751896 pergilah dan masuklah ke dalam surga sebab di sana tidak seperti di dunia melainkan sepuluh kali dunia
4751897 apakah engkau ejek aku atau engkau tertawakan aku sedang engkau adalah raja
4751898 apakah engkau masih ingat setiap orang berada di rumahnya sendiri sendiri

4752006 look farming generates wealth in this economy but the only ones who dont benefit from this wealth are the farmers

4752032 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
4752033 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4752034 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4752035 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4752036 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4752037 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
4752038 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4752039 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4752040 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm

4752042 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4752043 as sort of a clearing house for proper portfolios benchmarking
4752044 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4752045 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance
4752046 you bring up a major issue with performance measurement cash flows in a portfolio are handled differently than cash flows in an index so there will always be some irr tracking error in between the portfolio and the index in an index it is assumed that the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date and reinvested in the index however in a portfolio the divided does not come in until the dividend payment date and then it might take another day or so to reinvest so by default using irr the portfolio cannot match the irr of the index
4752047 for example if you start with 10 000 and then add 1 00 000 during a year there is a twr return calculation from the 10 000 contribution to the date the 1 000 000 was added then there is second calculation starting the day of the 1 000 000 contribution
4752048 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm

4752109 i have gunned the entire deployment and we have only taken fire once in a nutshell i am out there pulling security for the convoys and when it comes to getting stuff done we all pitch in
4752110 i take all the new gunners that come in and train them making sure to get them up to speed so that if i ever go down or go on leave that they will have no issues in taking my spot
4752111 i knew if the american soldiers came to the soccer game it would be a great opportunity for the unit to show support for the community and get to know some of the grass roots locals
4752112 its tough to watch a process that you know is going to be unsuccessful but as an instructor i know my students wont learn what i teach if i do everything for them
4752113 sometimes they surprise me when i think their way of doing something wont work only to watch them do it their way and do so successfully
4752114 i have never seen a more respectable disciplined and organized iraqi police unit
4752115 the iraqi police have a great educational and developmental setup for the new iraqis enlisting in this police force
4752116 no history of our nation is complete without telling the incredible story of the army and the american soldier our countrys heritage is one of freedom an inalienable right that was not given to our people but won with great effort

4752118 iraqs two main offshore oil terminals are located in iraqi territorial waters out at sea about 19 miles from the iraqi coast
4752119 it is a mission that admiral jawad and his sailors and marines take very seriously and are executing with great professionalism
4752120 this was such a positive step to get this many journalists together and discuss sources stories and risk taking that is inherent in journalism
4752121 this will help them become more independent and effective as journalists in a free society
4752122 when coalition forces stood up this school they worked with the iraqis to set up goals they wanted to achieve within a certain amount of time
4752123 some of the goals reached include the ability to run four training programs at the same time having fully renovated facilities with the ability to house 500 students and the availability of qualified iraqi instructors to lead the courses todays class represents the attainment of those goals in the bmt program
4752124 this is the nineteenth cache weve found before this cache we found another cache that was rockets but this one was also a big cache

4752137 sad reflections of the attitude which allowed a terrible inhumane politician
4752138 falls from 64 per barrel in 2006 to 53 per barrel in 2030
4752139 keep out johnson he supports bush and opposes kyoto he is the british equivalent of bush when it comes to the war and environment
4752140 i dont agree with you so that means you are spouting nonsense
4752141 and the truth is that what boris johnson likes is not what you or i like he doesnt share londoners values in fact in many ways he seems to hate them
4752142 boris johnson in contrast would come with a built in tory majority enabling him to do anything he likes over the heads of a powerless opposition in the assembly
4752143 greenladywell you are mistaken to say the least and dishonest when it comes to the green party policies decentralisation has been kicked out thats its still in the books is because they have not changed it yet but they will have to because the two notions are incompatible and schumacher is turning in his grave small is not beautifull anymore according to the greens is centrally lead politics
4752144 why does the green party even if the melon theory is somehwat true lol stand against those it has campaigned with in the stop the war coalition
4752145 the green partys membership is not representative of a multicultural society indeed it is white and middle class still because nobody can be bothered to change this fact so why should multicultural london vote for them
4752146 i do not think that sian has the brevity or green credentials to be a leader still they have not managed to prepare for coalition politics at national level
4752147 their hatred of the lib dems so childish and so damaging for the future is preventing a third way in britain a coalition choice for voters between the lib dems and greens red green coalitions are done everywhere but the reds in britain are not as green as the lib dems talking of cutting your feet off
4752148 as for threatening londoners with boris via all the nasty assumptions made in the article
4752149 ie vote for the lesser evil whilst being eaten by kens mismanagement for breakfast relying on verbal hand outs at the mayors monthly rebutals is frankly pathetic
4752150 grow up green party you have just thrown away your roots and your spine what little made you special in the whole political landscape and for what

4752154 a green tax for those who own certain cars in london
4752155 ensure that those who choose to carry on driving the most polluting vehicles help pay for the environmental damage they cause
4752156 it would be more appropriate for porsche to put its effort into making a new generation of much less polluting vehicles
4752157 manufacturers are already modifying their cars to come in just under the co2 threshold
4752158 unfairness to porsche owners was unlikely to wash with the high court
4752159 when you find yourself arguing on the side of a petulant car company against the interests of ordinary londoners you should realise youve taken opposition for oppositions sake too far
4752160 the part of the waistcloth that falls below the ankles is in the fire
4752161 whoever treads on his waistcloth in pride will tread on it in the fire
4752162 on the day of resurrection allah will not look at the one who dragged his garment out of pride
4752163 o messenger of allah my waistcloth slips down if i do not pay attention to it
4752164 you are not one of those who do it out of pride
4752165 do not worry about it because you did not let it slip on purpose
4752166 why do we find some texts on the subject fail to mention the condition of pride
4752167 this is because letting ones garments hang below the ankle gives an impression of pride and is therefore disliked as is anything else that gives an impression something sinful
4752168 unlike the other two main candidates neither i or my partner have a car

4752178 our study reveals potentially clinically relevant differences in the gene expression of different cancer types and represents a reference framework for interpretation of smaller scale functional studies

4752180 oh go ahead and buy that old fashioned milk can for the front porch

4752185 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4752186 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4752216 el problema de la detenci n no regulada de inmigrantes no es nuevo
4752217 hemos aumentado el n mero de camas en nuestras instalaciones de detenci n y continuaremos aument ndolas

4752252 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
4752253 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

4752260 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
4752261 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn

4752263 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
4752264 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price

4752320 i was very nervous about the blog site but tom guided me through its creation and i am now decidedly unleashed it gave me the confidence to write my novel
4752321 i always start a novel by starting its first page and last page which seem to survive almost intact through all the following drafts and changes
4752322 tom is one of the most genuine down to earth and practical inspirers i have ever met his workshop in edinburgh was a joy and i have come away with a structured plan and even better the title of my first novel which will be one of a series tom channeled this information for me and so i found the mix of hard scientific planning alongside metaphysics a heady and powerful combination thanking you eternally tom for helping to make my dream a reality keep up the good work we need this kind of practical support and mentoring from someone who really cares about people
4752323 they say theres a book in everyone but for most people the thought of writing their best seller is so daunting they simply never start another reason people dont pick up their pen is because they think they simply dont have the time there is a way though the human mind is so powerful that your book can virtually write itself without your conscious control
4752324 the key to getting your book to write itself is to engage in
4752325 dont be stupid you dont have time to write a book and who would be interested in reading it anyway
4752326 by mind mapping this logical left hemisphere is kept happy as it has a structure to deal with
4752327 with both hemispheres working in harmony authors are then helped even further by introducing them to guided meditations to quieten the conscious mind and give them access to their unconscious
4752328 there is no other way to write a book tom injects a certain magic to the whole process from thinking i couldnt write a book to suddenly finding the words flowing was fantastic an excellent balance of structure and creativity loads of practical info on how to write and get published

4752333 i attended toms workshop today expecting a course about the mechanics of writing what i got was even better which was the mechanics of inspiration tom showed us how to think about writing but also how to stop thinking about it and start doing it it has inspired me to action if you want to write a book or even just write regular articles then i thoroughly recommend it
4752334 there is no other way to write a book tom injects a certain magic to the whole process
4752335 tom is able to communicate complex ideas and theories in an extremely engaging fashion budding authors will find tom inspiring
4752336 this is cutting edge thinking about how our minds work but presented in an easily digestible manner
4752337 his insights intuition and inspiration are invaluable from thinking i couldnt write a book to suddenly finding the words flowing was fantastic tom has an amazing way of seeing the things that you dont see during the writing process which helps unblock those writers block moments
4752338 he mentors you in assembling your material in the best way possible leading to the addition of dimensions that you had not even thought of yet i now have restored belief in my writing ability and creativity
4752339 there is no other way to write a book tom injects a certain magic to the whole process his insights intuition and inspiration are invaluable from thinking i couldnt write a book to suddenly finding the words flowing was fantastic
4752340 this is cutting edge thinking about how our minds work but presented in an easily digestible manner
4752341 really made me focus on the vision it helped me identify realistic strategies and time frames my initial vision has now evolved into two books
4752342 the course exceeded my expectations the structure of the day was excellent i loved the mind maps as they provided an amazing visual effect on my thinking

4752371 between them theyve put out something like a hundred books and in all those years of chatter all those forests laid to waste neither of them has been able to come up with one lifelike woman character
4752372 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
4752373 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive
4752374 maybe i can get you on charlies show you and one of the patriarchs

4752377 for information about the rally or what else you can do to fight the genocide see with african union peacekeepers scheduled to leave darfur at the end of this month and the sudanese government mounting a military campaign against helpless and starving darfurians the horrific situation there may very well turn even worse for hundreds of thousands of people

4752388 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4752389 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4752390 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4752391 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4752392 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4752393 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4752394 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4752395 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4752396 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4752397 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4752398 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4752399 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4752400 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4752401 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4752402 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4752403 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4752404 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4752405 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4752406 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4752407 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4752408 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4752409 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4752410 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4752411 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4752412 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4752413 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4752414 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4752415 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4752416 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

4752426 this is a planning took where all things are going
4752427 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4752428 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4752429 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4752430 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4752431 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4752432 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others

4752437 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4752438 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4752439 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4752440 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4752441 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4752442 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4752443 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4752444 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4752445 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4752446 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection

4752450 winning an olympic medal in any discipline is not easy and the womens singles field in tennis is very very tough winning a medal in womens singles or doubles will have to be against all odds
4752451 but as someone representing the country it is my duty to do whatever i possibly can to try and achieve this glory for my country
4752452 it is a tremendous honour to represent india at the olympics but i believe i carry the hopes of my people in every event that i participate in including the grand slams the pressure is not new to me and i consider it a great privilege
4752453 im playing in tournaments in stanford los angeles and stockholm to get into the best shape i can before the olympics
4752454 the power is gradually coming back and the control is better but it may still take me a few weeks before im back to the level i was playing at before my injury
4752455 when i underwent the surgery barely three months ago id never imagined that i would be back competing at the highest level so soon and im happy with my comeback although im still finding my way around
4752456 doubles is comparatively easier as the physical effort required to compete is not as demanding as in singles in which even a minor injury can be ruthlessly exposed
4752457 it is unfortunate but almost everyone in the top 100 is struggling with injuries in order to compete today at the highest level one need to push ones body to the limit and in doing so we expose ourselves to various kinds of injuries
4752458 its a professional hazard and there are no guarantees to our physical well being
4752459 we will practise together in beijing but there does not seem to be a possibility of us playing together in tournaments before the olympics we have not played together since a very long time but sunitha has had some good results in doubles recently and im looking forward to playing with her
4752460 for me sport is more about trying to capitalise on whatever opportunities one gets and not cribbing about what we do not or could not have
4752461 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4752462 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4752463 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4752464 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4752465 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4752466 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4752467 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4752468 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4752469 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4752470 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4752471 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

4752475 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4752476 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4752477 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4752478 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4752479 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4752480 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4752481 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4752482 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4752483 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4752484 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4752485 booksmart to go is a great way to create interesting projects from photopro images all you need to do is import edit and print

4752490 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4752491 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4752492 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4752493 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4752494 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4752495 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4752496 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4752497 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4752498 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4752499 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4752500 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4752501 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4752502 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4752503 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4752504 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4752505 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4752506 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4752507 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4752508 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4752509 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4752510 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4752511 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4752512 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4752513 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4752514 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4752515 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4752516 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4752517 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4752518 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4752519 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

4752562 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4752563 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4752564 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4752565 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4752566 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4752567 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4752568 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4752569 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4752570 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4752571 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4752572 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4752573 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4752574 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4752575 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4752576 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4752577 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4752578 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4752579 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4752580 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4752581 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4752582 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4752583 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing

4752598 a lot of the wheat crops are starting to show a lot of fusarium mainly due to the moist conditions we had at flowering
4752599 when you look at the head of the wheat it actually has white areas in it which basically are not going to produce viable seed or good quality seed were seeing it pretty much in every wheat field
4752600 this mimicked estrogen can bind with receptor sites and it can interfere with things like return to estrus if exposure happens while the sow or gilt is pregnant they can have a greater degree of still births so it acts in this negative way by mimicking naturally occurring hormones
4752601 in the last couple of years by the end of june the beginning of july the tap shut off and we werent getting much moisture
4752602 were getting back to where we were getting moisture during the flowering time and filling and were going to be seeing more concerns about fusarium and probably more talk about fusarium resistant varieties
4752603 i think this year is kind of a check year to show us the disease is out there and can cause a bit of damage
4752604 one of the things about fusarium its going to depend on how early it affects the plant a lot of times if it affects the plant early a lot of those seeds wont make it into the sample so the levels found in the sample might be low enough that it wont cause any great discounts
4752605 if theyre starting to have feed refusal if youre starting to have longer weaned to breeding intervals take a look at your grain and your inclusion rates and perhaps decrease the inclusion rates of the contaminated feedstuffs because it can create a serious negative impact on your production

4752626 i dont know where that last 250m came from i always knew we had another gear but i never believed we could that

4752684 the courts role in reducing the incidence of impaired driving
4752685 a partnership with law enforcement is a necessity for problem solving courts coordination on such matters as a concentrated enforcement event like a saturation patrol is useful so courts can be prepared for an increase in caseload any partnership must be careful to avoid the perception that courts are another agency of enforcement and ensure that courts retain their role as neutral arbiter

4752751 because they know how to take care of their players
4752752 with the little guys going first the knicks had a chance to pick the first center of the draft and didnt bad move

4752772 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4752773 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4752774 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4752775 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4752776 a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future
4752777 right now their actions have been inconsistent with the premise that we and those in europe and around the world have inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a europe whole free and at peace so cooperation on a wide range of issues going forward depends on the actions that russia takes

4752784 to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god
4752785 which also said ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven
4752786 who was delivered for our offences and was raised again for our justification
4752787 for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us
4752788 who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us
4752789 wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them
4752790 and if christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins

4752801 from what they told us it was what they had in mind all along
4752802 allowed the primary campaign to go forward with the sexism in the media going unchecked by the party along with the disenfranchisement of florida and michigan and the shenanigans in iowa and texas in the caucuses
4752803 we simply cannot understand why the prevention of crime is not a priority in our society gabriel and josephine said in a joint statement to
4752804 why are we scared of a public register why are we scared of tough sentences such measures are not against law abiding citizens but to protect them we believe that parents have the right to know where pedophiles live crime can only be stopped if laws send the right message
4752805 the changes introduced by the current government some of which have been put on hold due to the election dont seem to go far enough to make a difference
4752806 for our family law and order is a top priority we believe that sending a tough message that society will not tolerate such crimes is in itself a deterrent
4752807 after sofias death we suffered when a child was bashed to death because he wet his pants and when a chinese student was killed while walking home they said
4752808 we suffered when an old lady living alone was robbed in the middle of the night in the privacy of her own home and savagely bashed
4752809 we also suffer when such crimes earn for their perpetrators absurdly light sentences that reflect neither the vicious crime nor the communitys outrage
4752810 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can engage the work to achieve national healing and reconciliation
4752811 attend to the matter of reconstruction and development of zimbabwe and in this way extricate the masses of the people from the dire straits in which they find themselves
4752812 im certain that the millions of zimbabweans both inside and outside zimbabwe await with great expectations and high hopes a positive outcome from our deliberations
4752813 the most important car free event in new york city history
4752814 frantic campaign has targeted many charities and service organizations by storming closing and confiscating the belongings of these organizations
4752815 without any legal justification just under the claim that they were closeto hamas in many cases the campaign targeted private businesses under a shameless accusation that the owners receive money from hamas
4752816 we congratulate the local united food and commercial workers canada union and workers at gatineau que tire and lube operation on being the first wal mart location in north america with a collective agreement in place
4752817 at first glance this will have a significant impact on our business model which is to offer the best prices to our clientele
4752818 the employer does not want to modify his business model this is likely the reason why negotiations stalled and why the parties could not reach a deal at the end of the first labour agreement
4752819 so we have the markets expecting the bank to cut uk rates later this year and also people expecting the us to come out of the slowdown before the uk and europe
4752820 mervyn king has only now shifted the focus to weak growth so the market is anticipating a recovery over there faster than over here
4752821 a year ago the feeling was that sterling had been overvalued for the best part of a decade so a gentle decline would be welcome to help rebalance away from such strong reliance on consumer and government spending towards a greater contribution from exports and investment
4752822 we have a medal board in our hotel and seeing the medals go up in the first couple of days was great
4752823 its looking really good for the whole team especially looking ahead to 2012
4752824 other countries like australia now look to us as a country who got serious about sport and are now saying that they are in danger of falling behind team great britain in the medals table
4752825 i understand the scepticism is the olympic 100 metres champion clean yeah the question is inevitable it comes with the territory as past champions have been revealed to be doped there is just no doubt the olympic champion has to carry himself as a clean athlete
4752826 on the face of it at least it is a comparable situation johnson was beaten by lewis in zurich on the run in to seoul then slipped from sight his coach charlie francis claimed he didnt know where johnson was for a long stretch there was a theory that he was nursing his wounds in jamaica lets put it this way if gay was to come here without racing and put in a winning performance some people would be very suspicious
4752827 normally the olympic favourite is the fastest man in the world with that comes a lot of pressure and thats what usain bolt is getting now that he has the world record people inside and out of jamaica expect him to win it people from the jamaica camp are coming to me and saying man dont spoil our clean sweep well thats good for me because usain hasnt run a whole series of championship races at 100 metres he has the record and im the world champion and i think that balances things off whos the favourite a lot of people think i can win it and im one of them
4752828 i know powell hurt when he lost his world record to bolt and i know he was upset when i beat him in osaka but usain seems different he doesnt seem to let things build up around him he likes to do what he does and have fun
4752829 im enjoying all of this and im looking forward to the race
4752830 usain simply has more ways to win at his size 6ft 5in and 13st he shouldnt be able to move the way he does he shouldnt be able to cover 100 metres in 41 strides
4752831 what we have here are the three fastest men in the world anything can happen
4752832 i did project believe with usada us anti doping agency where i purposely wanted to do more tests to prove that people can question all they want but the facts are facts and i have the results to prove it
4752833 i have to work on speed and endurance and all four strokes i need the speed to get the starts and the endurance to carry it through you cant do it on talent alone a lot of hard work a lot of dedication
4752834 i dont overeat even when im not in training because i want to stay lean and mean not like some of the heavyweights around
4752835 life had been hell for them but football and being part of this team offers them hope and a focus the change in their body language their outlook on life has been fantastic to see not one of the players has suffered a relapse in the three years we have been together
4752836 as well as the physical aspects of the sport and the mental aspects of teamwork and tactics the squad socialise together and have made friends
4752837 some of the players also take part in committee matters which adds a further focus
4752838 i work all week in a horrible factory for miserable pay and give it all to my ungrateful wife to spend on our fat kids and her stupid bingo

4752849 buying a lap dance is not the same as buying a cappuccino
4752850 many local authorities have added their voice to growing calls for an end to licensing of lap dancing clubs as cafes
4752851 current licensing has acted as a floodgate to the industry whilst making it difficult for local authorities and local people to have a say in this process
4752852 im going to be out there in the next couple of days
4752853 im going to be playing the last two preseason games ill be ready
4752854 it started out as a groin it went to a hamstring and you know its been one thing after another that has not helped we went through this last year and we count on steve being out there so its been that position this year thats given us a lot of headaches
4752855 so im not extremely worried but im a little bit obviously its concerning because i havent kicked for five days and ive never missed a game before
4752856 you just dont want to get out there and set yourself back
4752857 obviously its trusting the doctors and vice president of medical services ronnie barnes who has been doing this for 30 years so they are very excited about my progress and im feeling good about it of course i would love to be out there but the last thing i want to do is go out there and then take five steps back its a four month surgery so im at four months i feel strong very strong i have no pain no soreness and maybe a little bit of swelling which is something that can be reoccurring but nothing that will keep me from working every day thats always good
4752858 we had no way we could find out whether the potential bidders had the funds or funding for a proposed purchase

4752898 life begins at 40 but so do fallen arches rheumatism faulty eyesight and the tendency to tell a story to the same person three or four times
4752899 at the age of 20 we dont care what the world thinks of us at 30 we worry about what it is thinking of us at 40 we discover that it wasnt thinking of us at all
4752900 at 20 years of age the will reigns at 30 the wit at 40 the judgement
4752901 forty is the old age of youth fifty is the youth of old age

4752910 i birdied the first three as soon as i did that my mind kind of set in and played nice all day made a lot of putts hit it close
4752911 i just had a brief moment thinking about it but then i was kind of laughing at myself
4752912 on the 15th tee and i decided to bogey the hole
4752913 overall it was good finished the round off good with birdies on 16 and 17 and made a nice four on the last
4752914 i didnt know if they re paved the racetrack or the car was that good obviously being early out contributed a little bit to that we knew that in the back of our minds we tried some stuff in practice and it didnt work then we went back to where we started and was pretty happy with it
4752915 as the need increased tampa bay has responded yet again we are just a few hundred backpacks short of providing hope to those on our waiting list with only one week left until school starts phone a friend tell a neighbor or rally your coworkers for the homerun stretch imagine the smile on a young childs face the grateful tear in the eye of a struggling mother once they receive a backpack of hope provided by you together we can provide the basic tools our children need to not only succeed in school but in life
4752916 the last 10 years have seen a three fold increase in the prescription of the drug ritalin a drug used for attention deficit disorder one asks why
4752917 why suddenly is there greater demand for a drug for attentional problems
4752918 this might and i stress might be something to do with the increased exposure of young children to unsupervised and lengthy hours in front of a screen
4752919 could it be and this is just a suggestion which i think we should look into could it be if a small child is sitting in front of a screen pressing buttons and getting reactions quickly for many hours they get used to and their brains get used to rapid responses
4752920 could it be that they then have to sit still for half an hour and of course theyre not used to that because theyre used to the rapid interaction with the screen and could it again a question be that they are fidgety and hyperactive and then diagnosed as having a disorder
4752921 what we need to question is this are we putting people into the optimum environment how can we create an environment which will pre dispose the brain to react in ways we consider ideal
4752922 the technology is creating an environment that is answer rich but were question poor

4752926 ik weet dat je de boodschapper was herman en dat er altijd mensen in het bestuur tegen mij zijn ik ben er zeker van dat dat bij cercle ook is maar ik wou niet weg bij alecht
4752927 als ik naar anderlecht kijk vraag ik me af of het de beste oplossing was om niet met mij door te gaan
4752928 nog eens neen ik heb me verbeterd bij cercle maar anderlecht is niet beter
4752929 ik ben er 13 jaar geweest en het is de nummer n in belgi maar ik ben bij cercle met mijn gat in de boter gevallen
4752930 op sommige punten staat cercle zelfs verder dan anderlecht dat zou niet mogen
4752931 als glen zich zo blijft ontwikkelen als coach wordt hij een topper

4752969 estoy seguro de que robinho se quedar para mi no es un problema ni tengo que volverme loco porque va a ser jugador nuestro
4752970 s lo puedo valorar lo que robinho hace con nosotros y como est en los minutos que ha jugado en todos los partidos que ha tenido en pretemporada lo ha hecho muy bien con mucha alegr a y en los entrenamientos pasa lo mismo en su actitud no he visto ning n cambio por eso como es jugador nuestro lo voy a utilizar el resto de cosas las conocemos y no le vamos a dar ninguna importancia porque no la merecen

4752985 heres a woman thats successful takes care of herself looks amazing and she took the steps to get there it doesnt happen unless you take charge shes a great role model for many many women
4752986 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4752987 i was in high school when she hit it big
4752988 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4752989 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4752990 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4752991 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4752992 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4752993 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4752994 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4752995 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4752996 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4752997 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4752998 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4752999 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4753000 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4753001 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4753002 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4753003 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4753004 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4753005 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4753006 we do want to have a long term relationship with brett

4753011 you get past the preliminaries and make it to the finals it can really take the pressure off
4753012 thats why im not afraid because theres not any more pressure this was the most pressure ill be under
4753013 your body and your brain know that theres pressure the first couple of throws
4753014 finally i just told myself to relax my body knows what to do if my brain doesnt get in the way
4753015 im 6 foot 4 with the leverage and long arms that i have who not just let my body take over
4753016 if we get through qualifying were able to come back monday against brand new competition and set our eyes on the podium but you cant get there unless to past day 1
4753017 and any margin for technical errors is small and precise its like that game where you beat down the little hedgehog and up pops another one thats where i am right now i make an adjustment something else pops up
4753018 this is where my age and experience has helped me more than anybody else having gone through this event so many times youve got to get it right once right

4753031 something said its yours baby take it but i didnt do it

4753033 its very special to them to be here and see such an accomplishment and to see me reach my dream and right in front of their eyes
4753034 i was the first in the family to be born in canada my parents are both very hard working
4753035 she was stronger physically and technically stronger in all respects
4753036 winning the bronze this time was even harder than winning the gold at the athens olympics in 2004 even though i have been three times world champion
4753037 i think its a great way to start it off
4753038 hopefully the pressure has come off the people that compete tomorrow
4753039 just as we were on the water the pair was out there winning the gold
4753040 it was great to get on the water then because we were happy
4753041 it wasnt expected that wed get a medal because the olympics is such a huge event
4753042 and it was almost embarrassing to do that but there wasnt anything left in the tank at least i held on today
4753043 in womens pair romanias georgeta andrunache and viorica susanu won the gold medal bringing their combined career olympic gold medal haul to nine yuliya bichyk and natallia helakh of belarus won bronze in 7 22 91

4753056 these are baseball decisions the shakeups got to come from the guys that are expected to perform melky cabrera batting ninth in our lineup is not supposed to be a difference maker in this club either way he was supposed to be able to slide right in while everybody else did their job
4753057 what we need is obviously the guys were counting on the guys that are making a significant amount of money that have significant performance levels to get the job done as expected and ill throw myself involved in that too i want to make sure im not pointing fingers were all in this thing together
4753058 its definitely good to get the opportunity to go out there and be that guy
4753059 we just felt that it was time for him to go work on some things you cant forget how young melky is
4753060 we believe that hes a much better player than a 240 hitter
4753061 the effort was there but for whatever reason it wasnt translating sometimes it can be difficult for young players to get out of a rut at this level
4753062 i cant tell you the exact date that hes going to be back but im confident that melkys a big league player and that hell get his stuff right
4753063 i have to go to triple a and work hard

4753071 i have to go to triple a and work hard
4753072 i want to pitch for a long time i dont want to pitch for a year so i understand ive got to be patient
4753073 drank los nie probleme op nie maar so ook nie melk of water nie
4753074 ek voel nou so goed ek vul sommer die lottonommers verkeerd in
4753075 ek is nou so lui ek trou sommer n pregnant vrou
4753076 ondervinding is iets wat jy eers kry nadat jy dit nodig het

4753085 i watched paul ince play when i was a boy
4753086 i used to watch him on tv i looked up to him when he played for england to now play under him is a massive thing
4753087 he was a tough player and thats what i like to be
4753088 hopefully ill be able to show blackburn fans that i like to get stuck in and get forward
4753089 last year i got a few games because gary neville was injured
4753090 but gary is back now and coming to blackburn is a good opportunity for me to go out and get a few games and learn my trade
4753091 i dont think theres any guarantee of playing every week
4753092 but as long as im training hard and showing the gaffer what i can do then hopefully i will get my chance its up to me to take it
4753093 im still contracted to manchester united its the club i support and i would love to play for them for the rest of my career
4753094 they always tend to be tough games between the two sides with not that many goals in them
4753095 ive been looking with interest at burnley through the close season and with the additions theyre making to the squad
4753096 the players that were already there are good players but theyve really strengthened the team for this season
4753097 steve cotterill tried to do that a little bit last season and its great to see robbie blake and ade akinbiyi back there
4753098 as owen coyles taken over hes looked at what he needs and tried to strengthen it that way
4753099 i can see robbie and ade both scoring a couple of goals along with martin paterson who looks a decent player already and im sure with the good coaching staff and players around him he can only improve
4753100 theres a good squad there at the moment and the way they seem to be a confident bunch of lads so fingers crossed they have a great season
4753101 i think they should be looking to try to sneak into the top six or at least the top 10
4753102 ipswich have got to be looking beyond that though and go for the top two
4753103 their home form was tremendous last year it was their away form that let them down but hopefully theyve rectified that
4753104 i played under george burley at the very beginning and then joe royle took over
4753105 we were an attacking team all over the pitch i was there to defend but we took confidence from scoring goals and knew that every game we went into we could win 1 0 or 3 2
4753106 we were very confident in ourselves we were similar ages too around 25 and 27 which helped and there were a couple of older pros like jim magilton and tony mowbray so there was a nice blend
4753107 we were on a crest of a wave but when the second season started we didnt put our foot on the gas and before we knew it we were more or less rock bottom
4753108 its always been the hardest division to get out of but there are so many big clubs now in the championship
4753109 dont forget to take a wheelbarrow youll need it to carry off your haul

4753114 youve done it now girls name you are an excellent kisser how am i supposed to get thoughts of you out of my head now
4753115 really after that lil kiss haha im tempted to ask u to come here and kiss me again
4753116 if youd like me to i will gladly come over for another more thorough sampling of your kisses
4753117 youre a very sexy woman you shouldnt beat yourself up about the guy earlier

4753119 yes to be honest girls name ive had a crush on you since we first met and i know we only have a few weeks left here before we both graduate but i would really like to see you again
4753120 i cant think of anything off the top of my head for you and i to do but lets plan on you and i hanging out at 8
4753121 i was just telling girls name that i think shes a very sexy girl and that i would like to see her again
4753122 im going to go outside on the porch you guys can come if you want
4753123 the only bad question is one in which you dont really care about the answer
4753124 the leader of the group isnt the one everyone listens to its the one everyone talks to
4753125 you only have to win over two people in the group
4753126 everyone wants to be liked but only when it makes sense
4753127 it absolutely doesnt matter how interesting i am to a woman what matters is how interesting she is to me
4753128 nobody is really thinking about you everyone else is thinking about what everyone else is thinking about them at the end of the day they reflect their own actions and other peoples reactions to them

4753134 he always had a soft spot for people who were in need and i think that came from growing up with people who never had a lot of everything

4753179 i knew they were going to give him everything he wanted
4753180 ive been watching the scoring here the first four days and i knew it was bad so i was expecting it i think they were giving him a score for anything and i had to work to get all of my points
4753181 i thought they were very generous to the chinese you expect a slight bias but you come to the olympic games and expect a level playing field
4753182 joe didnt box the best ive seen him but the scoring makes a difference and the tactics had to be changed because of the scoring everything the chinese guy touched they pressed the button for him
4753183 im very sad i thought i would be the winner i already beat him once before
4753184 some things you just dont ever want to say so i wont but it was just weird the way the scoring was
4753185 its very stunning and the thing were going to try to keep letting our guys know is youve got to try to keep it out of the hands of the judges thats a hard thing to do

4753208 im certain that the millions of zimbabweans both inside and outside zimbabwe await with great expectations and high hopes a positive outcome from our deliberations
4753209 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still

4753299 set aside his own reading of the constitution the judges past instructions and judge the facts solely upon the judges explanation of the law
4753300 i consider trial by jury the greatest anchor ever yet devised by humankind for holding a government to the principles of its constitution
4753301 a form of juror misconduct that could be classified as nullification
4753302 many cases never reach trial because the lawyers do not feel comfortable presenting their case to twelve of their fellow citizens
4753303 judges should sometimes nullify statutes that are bad policy or create judge made rules when that would serve the ends of good policymaking
4753304 the judiciary never could have become a vibrant countermajoritarian force and create a nationwide system that makes binding constitutional adjudication as close as the nearest federal courthouse
4753305 nullifiers do not openly disobey the law in order to change it
4753306 they conspire behind closed doors and cast the law aside at their caprice

4753308 we are just enjoying being engaged and being with each other
4753309 all the actuaries all the objective scorekeepers of the federal government are predicting this
4753310 they say we are 53 trillion short of fulfilling the promises the government is making to the american people in todays dollars
4753311 meaning that if we want to keep the promises of medicare medicaid and social security which are basically the three major entitlement programs today we would have to set aside 53 trillion dollars and invest them at treasury rates in order to do it
4753312 for the last 40 years the federal government has had to tax every dollar made in america at 18 3 cents on that dollar to pay the bills of the federal government
4753313 by the time my three children who are three five and six years old are my age the federal government will have to tax 40 cents out of every dollar made in america just to pay the bills for the federal government at that time
4753314 they said that the current low rate the 10 percent bracket for low income americans would have to go up to 25 percent the middle income tax rate for middle income americans would have to go up to 66 percent and the top rate which is what small businesses pay would have to go to 88 percent
4753315 those would be the tax rates you would have to have if you wanted to tax your way out of this problem
4753316 and if you did that all experts conclude you would literally crash the american economy
4753317 the legacy of this country has always been that each generation confronts the challenges before it so that the next generation is better off
4753318 in the past we brought down the iron curtain and won the cold war we got through world war i we got through world war ii we won the war on the great depression
4753319 the problem that we have right now putting foreign policy aside and our fight with islamic radicalism is that we have an economic crisis we have a fiscal crisis and that is we will bankrupt this country and the best century in america will be the last century
4753320 unless we turn our fiscal situation around and pay off this debt and change the way these programs work to a more sustainable path the next generation will have inferior living standards
4753321 a roadmap for americas future a plan to solve americas long term fiscal and economic crisis
4753322 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
4753323 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
4753324 the war is when military fight against military but the georgian army is killing innocent civilians this is genocide
4753325 while the ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the bbc neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of ossetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian shelling of the breakaway republic all we are getting is one sided reports of the destruction being caused by the russians
4753326 the bbc is giving carte blanche to the georgian point of view to be aired on its services while nothing whatsoever is being heard from the ossetian side the bbcs repetitive playing of a statement by george bush given several days ago without balancing these against statements from the russian side indicates where the bbc is coming from
4753327 georgia is an outpost of us and nato forces on the immediate border of the russian federation and within proximity of the middle east central asian war theater south ossetia is also at the crossroads of strategic oil and gas pipeline routes
4753328 georgia does not act militarily without the assent of washington the georgian head of state is a us proxy and georgia is a de facto us protectorate
4753329 in yesterdays attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to have black skin possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet we will be able to publish the official conclusions after carrying out special tests
4753330 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
4753331 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
4753332 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
4753333 have a free appropriate public education the emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education employment and independent living

4753355 the last major project i undertook was to work on the design manufacture and marketing of the fiori deserter
4753356 tell me a bit about the relationship between fiori and fianetti
4753357 fiori was a wholly owned subsidiary of fianetti theyd been in business nearly a hundred years but the marques were quite distinct and it made sense to keep them that way fianetti was at the height of its expansion drive it had even acquired mendistan at 15 under book everything must have looked wonderful but of course it was the exact opposite we were just entering the recession a few months later cashflow had dried up all round that was when i stepped in
4753358 so the plan was for you to turn it around and bring fiori back into profit
4753359 no that wasnt my intention at all i only got involved when it became clear fianetti were going to pull the plug on fiori they just couldnt afford to carry it any more in fact that was a condition of my employment i explained when i took the post that if fiori became profitable during my tenure there i intended to leave
4753360 im not sure i understand you wanted fiori to go bust
4753361 well without fianetti fiori was going to go bust anyway it was probably already bust in all but name the deserter was financed largely by ourselves fiori employees and i put in obviously a good chunk of my personal savings too that and a very small advance from fianetti almost nothing actually we had seen the writing on the wall and we didnt want to be disappointed with ourselves not this last time fiori was one of those old school shops many of them were working into their sixties and theyd apprenticed there at fiori theyd seen a lot of cars come and go a lot of interesting designs some talent and lets be frank some fairly hefty mistakes too we knew it was the end of the road even if things worked out then that was really only like tacking on another bit of road and saying youre not there yet youre not there quite yet but youre nearly there all the same i suppose what im driving at is that fiori was tired do you know how it is to be tired not just individually but collectively to be collectively and as it were historically tired to be a tired marque and at the same time to be physically tired remember that two thirds of the workforce were over fifty there was nowhere else they could go they were having to stick around its a bit like finding a very small body of water in the middle of a desert and then sitting there day after day not daring to move because you cant see any water anywhere else yet you cant help watching it grow smaller day after day so none of us wanted to make anything beautiful that would have been to miss the point and also more importantly to lie to ourselves no we wanted to make something different something which said theres been enough fooling around and weve seen everything come and go well make what we make best and you and your fads can lump it we wanted our own swan song in a car when we chose the essex v6 it was partly because of its pedigree in a similarly doomed project though actually a significantly better car the reliant scimitar
4753362 it seems incredible that you were able to design and produce a car on virtually nothing
4753363 oh absolutely it was ridiculous completely ridiculous from the start go up to anyone in the industry and say you want to bring a new line to market and youve got a budget of a few million and theyll show you the door faster than you can say jack robinson but you have to remember that this project had different goals when you are doing something you all believe in when youre staking your own money when sometimes youre not even drawing your salary working after hours using every trick in the book every way you can think of to cut corners without actually damaging the design we all knew that what we took out as beer money was money that we took away from the deserter and so we took as little as we could and we worked as fast as we could i think for nearly six months we lived on air air and water
4753364 so you didnt intend to make money yet you did intend to make the car
4753365 what we intended to make was exactly what we made what we made together
4753366 for if someone likes something and is conscious that he himself does so without any interest then he cannot help judging that it must contain a basis for being liked that holds for everyone he must believe that he is justified in requiring a similar liking from everyone because he cannot discover underlying his liking any private conditions on which only he might be dependent so that he must regard it as based on what he can presuppose in everyone else as well

4753374 there will of course be a universal language which will be either esperanto or pidgin english the literature of the past will for the most part not be translated into this language since its outlook and emotional background will be considered unsettling serious students of history will be able to obtain a permit from the government to study such works as hamlet and othello but the general public will be forbidden access to them on the ground that they glorify private murder boys will not be allowed to read books about pirates or red indians love themes will be discouraged on the ground that love being anarchic is silly if not wicked all this will make life very pleasant for the virtuous
4753375 the nineteenth century suffered from a curious division between its political ideas and its economic practice in politics it carried out the liberal ideas of locke and rousseau which were adapted to a society of small peasant proprietors its watchwords were liberty and equality but meantime it was inventing the technique which is leading the twentieth century to destroy liberty and to replace equality by new forms of oligarchy the prevalence of liberal thought has been in some ways a misfortune since it has prevented men of large vision from thinking out in an impersonal manner the problems raised by industrialism socialism and communism it is true are essentially industrial creeds but their outlook is so much dominated by the class war that they have little leisure to give to anything but the means of achieving political victory traditional morality gives very little help in the modern world a rich man may plunge millions into destitution by some act which not even the severest catholic confessor would consider sinful while he will need absolution for a trivial sexual aberration which at the worst has wasted an hour that might have been more usefully employed there is need of a new doctrine on the subject of my duty to my neighbour it is not only traditional religious teaching that fails to give adequate guidance on this subject but also the teaching of nineteenth century liberalism take for example such a book as mill on liberty mill maintains that while the state has a right to interfere with those of my actions that have serious consequences to others it should leave me free where the effects of my actions are mainly confined to myself such a principle however in the modern world leaves hardly any scope for individual freedom as society becomes more organic the effects of men upon each other become more and more numerous and important so that there remains hardly anything in regard to which mills defence of liberty is applicable take for example freedom of speech and of the press it is clear that a society that permits these is thereby precluded from various achievements which are possible to a society that forbids them in time of war this is obvious to everybody because in war time the national purpose is simple and the causation involved is obvious hitherto it has not been customary for a nation in peace time to have any national purpose except the preservation of its territory and its constitution a government which like that of soviet russia has a purpose in peace time as ardent and definite as that of other nations in war time is compelled to curtail freedom of speech and of the press as much while it is at peace as other nations do when they are at war the diminution of individual liberty which has been taking place during the last twenty years is likely to continue since it has two continuing causes on the one hand modern technique makes society more organic on the other hand modern sociology makes men more and more aware of the causal laws in virtue of which one mans acts are useful or harmful to another man if we are to justify any particular form of individual liberty in the scientific society of the future we shall have to do it on the ground that that form of liberty is for the good of society as a whole but not in most cases on the ground that the acts concerned affect nobody but the agent
4753376 the man who dreams of a scientifically organized world and wishes to translate his dream into practice finds himself faced with many obstacles there is the opposition of inertia and habit people wish to continue behaving as they always have behaved and living as they always have lived there is the opposition of vested interest an economic system inherited from feudal times gives advantages to men who have done nothing to deserve them and these men being rich and powerful are able to place formidable obstacles in the way of fundamental change in addition to these forces there are also hostile idealisms christian ethics is in certain fundamental respects opposed to the scientific ethic which is gradually growing up christianity emphasizes the importance of the individual soul and is not prepared to sanction the sacrifice of an innocent man for the sake of some ulterior good to the majority christianity in a word is unpolitical as is natural since it grew up among men devoid of political power the new ethic which is gradually growing in connexion with scientific technique will have its eye upon society rather than upon the individual it will have little use for the superstition of guilt and punishment but will be prepared to make individuals suffer for the public good without inventing reasons purporting to show that they deserve to suffer in this sense it will be ruthless and according to traditional ideas immoral but the change will have come about naturally through the habit of viewing society as a whole rather than as a collection of individuals we view a human body as a whole and if for example it is necessary to amputate a limb we do not consider it necessary to prove first that the limb is wicked we consider the good of the whole body a quite sufficient argument similarly the man who thinks of society as a whole will sacrifice a member of society for the good of the whole without much consideration for that individuals welfare this has always been the practice in war because war is a collective enterprise soldiers are exposed to the risk of death for the public good although no one suggests that they deserve death but men have not hitherto attached the same importance to social purposes other than war and have therefore shrunk from inflicting sacrifices which were felt to be unjust i think it probable that the scientific idealists of the future will be free from this scruple not only in time of war but in time of peace also in overcoming the difficulties of the opposition that they will encounter they will find themselves organized into an oligarchy of opinion such as is formed by the communist party in the u s s r
4753377 in suggesting any curtailment of liberty there are always two quite distinct questions to be considered the first is whether such a curtailment would be in the public interest if it were wisely carried out and the second is whether it will be in the public interest when it is carried out with a certain measure of ignorance and perversity these two questions are in theory quite distinct but from the point of view of the government the second question does not exist since every government believes itself entirely free from both ignorance and perversity every government consequently in so far as it is not restrained by traditional prejudices will advocate more interference with liberty than is wise when therefore as in this chapter we are considering what interferences with liberty might be theoretically justified we must hesitate to draw the conclusion that they should be advocated in practice i think it probable however that almost all interferences with liberty for which there is a theoretical justification will in time be carried out in practice because scientific technique is gradually making governments so strong that they need not consider outside opinion the result of this will be that governments will be able to interfere with individual liberty wherever in their opinion there is a sound reason for so doing and for the reason just given this will be much more often than it should be for this reason scientific technique is likely to lead to a governmental tyranny which may in time prove disastrous
4753378 let us take some examples of traditional principles which appear no longer defensible to take a more important illustration consider the immense sums of money that are spent on advertising it cannot possibly be maintained that these bring any but the most meagre return to the community the principle of permitting each capitalist to invest his money as he chooses is not therefore socially defensible
4753379 take again the question of work both the kind of work and the method of performing it at present young people choose their own trade or profession usually because at the moment of their choice it seems to afford a good opening a well informed person possessed of foresight might know that the particular line in question was going to be much less profitable a few years hence in such a case some public guidance to the young might prove extremely useful and as regards technical methods it is seldom in the public interest that an antiquated or wasteful technique should be allowed to persist when a more economical technique is known at present owning to the irrational character of the capitalist system the interest of the individual wage earner is very often opposed to the interest of the community since economical methods may cause him to lose his job this is due to the survival of capitalistic principles in a society which has grown so organic that it ought not to tolerate them it is obvious that in a well organized community it should be impossible for a large body of individuals to profit by preserving an inefficient technique it is clear that the use of the most efficient technique should be enforced and no wage earner should be allowed to suffer by its enforcement
4753380 i come now to a matter which touches the individual more intimately i mean the question of propagation it has hitherto been considered that any man and woman not within the prohibited degrees have a right to marry and having married have a right if not a duty to have as many children as nature may decree this is a right which the scientific society of the future is not likely to tolerate in any given state of industrial and agricultural technique there is an optimum density of population which ensures a greater degree of material well being than would result from either an increase or a diminution of numbers as a general rule except in new countries the density of population has been beyond this optimum though perhaps france in recent decades has been an exception except where there is property to be inherited the member of a small family suffers almost as much from over population as the member of a large family those who cause over population are therefore doing an injury not only to their own children but to the community it may therefore be assumed that society will discourage them if necessary as soon as religious prejudices no longer stand in the way of such action the same question will arise in a more dangerous form as between different nations and different races if a nation finds that it is losing military superiority through a lower birth rate than that of a rival it may attempt as has already been done in such cases to stimulate its own birth rate but when this proves ineffective as it probably will there will be a tendency to demand a limitation in the birth rate of the rival nation an international government if it ever comes into being will have to take account of such matters and just as there is at present a quota of national immigrants into the united states so in future there will be a quota of national immigrants into the world children in excess of the licensed figure will presumably be subjected to infanticide this would be less cruel than the present method which is to kill them by war or starvation i am however only prophesying a certain future not advocating it quality as well as quantity of population is likely to become a matter for public regulation already in many states of america it is permissible to sterilized the mentally defective and a similar proposal in england is in the domain of practical politics this is only the first step as time goes on we may expect a greater and greater percentage of the population to be regarded as mentally defective from the point of view of parenthood however that may be it is clear that the parents who have a child when there is every likelihood of its being mentally defective are doing a wrong both to the child and to the community no defensible principle of liberty therefore stands in the way of preventing them from such behaviour
4753381 equality like liberty is difficult to reconcile with scientific technique since this involves a great apparatus of experts and officials inspiring and controlling vast organizations

4753437 rhetoric is the art which seeks to capture in opportune moments that which is appropriate and attempts to suggest that which is possible
4753438 as the historical record indicates the sophists were master rhetoricians
4753439 the primary meaning of logos is something said by implication a subject topic of discourse or reasoning
4753440 the sophistic insistence that speaking be done with respect to time does not stem from a philosophical position regarding the nature of logos but from the observation that if what is said is timely its timeliness renders it more sensible more rightful and ultimately more persuasive
4753441 a compliment to the notion of kairos to prepon points out that situations have formal characteristics and demands that speaking as a response to a situation be suitable to those very characteristics
4753442 in this essay i have argued that the history of rhetoric dictates that the sophists views regarding the art of discourse need wider notice and further exploration extracting key ideas and terms from the preserved fragments of the sophists i have suggested a sophistic definition of rhetoric as art style as personal expression the timely the appropriate and the possible

4753684 estoy seguro de que robinho se quedar para mi no es un problema ni tengo que volverme loco porque va a ser jugador nuestro no es una preocupaci n
4753685 s lo puedo valorar lo que robinho hace con nosotros y como est en los minutos que ha jugado en todos los partidos que ha tenido en pretemporada lo ha hecho muy bien con mucha alegr a y en los entrenamientos pasa lo mismo en su actitud no he visto ning n cambio por eso como es jugador nuestro lo voy a utilizar el resto de cosas las conocemos y no le vamos a dar ninguna importancia porque no la merecen
4753686 en ning n momento robinho ha dado ninguna se al de que no quer a ir sabe que est bien con nosotros hay que separar las partes y l tiene la responsabilidad de ser jugador del real madrid est en las condiciones buenas como todos por eso tiene que jugar creo que es el primero que no ha pensado nunca en no viajar a valencia

4753700 emerged through public records and interviews with people close to mr edwards and ms hunter which suggested that their affair went on longer than mr edwards admitted and that the effort to conceal it by mr edwardss inner circle was much more extensive than has been reported

4753720 the word that comes to mind epic what you did tonight was epic
4753721 im just happy to be in the same sentence as those athletes carl lewis mary lou retton jesse owens and mark spitz all those guys are great olympians and they will always be great olympians
4753722 the great ones jordan woods montana seem to not only win but win in the most dramatic fashion blending excellence with great theater add michael phelps to that list over the past week the 23 year old has won in every which way possible hes dominated setting four individual world records hes done it with his eyes closed overcoming a faulty pair of goggles to win the 200m butterfly in the sprint relay he had to rely on his teammate jason lezak to deliver and tonight with the stakes raised even higher michael phelps an eye blink from defeat in the 100m fly took one last half stroke reached for the wall and somehow reached another milestone he couldnt have won by a smaller margin and he couldnt have scripted this piece of olympic history any better
4753723 hes magical he is superman i dont know how he did it
4753724 i was just talking to janet 10 minutes before the finals started i asked her well what do you think she says its going down it really is going down even the great janet evans thinks that
4753725 not quite i knew shawn was going after me and we were going head to head basically this entire year and i knew it would come down to the last performance and that point i was just happy i had given all my effort i knew i had nothing to regret so you know i was really happy with how i did today but i knew shawn was still after me and i was just cheering her on because i knew we had a chance to go 1 2 and i hoped thats how it would come out
4753726 by then i didnt care about the score or anything i wanted to go out and hit the routine of my life and finish this olympic experience as best as i could i have no regrets i take nothing back i had a great time and i am so honored to be wearing the silver medal
4753727 i was heading down to do my weather report which i do at 4 p m
4753728 on my way down to the weather compound i hear a goat yelling
4753729 i went into the stall crouched down trying to feel her
4753730 as i reached for her all of a sudden this crushing force on my arm and thats what it was something grabbed my arm
4753731 as my eyes got accustomed i realized i am you know roughly 18 inches to two foot from the face of a wolf
4753732 i came down here to the end of the stall and i went go shoo go and he just turned his head and looked and me and i thought oh no
4753733 its upper canines were broken and chipped and some teeth worn down
4753734 it was obviously an old animal it wasnt all skin and bones but it was quite thin
4753735 i was very lucky that it was an old wolf and i had on four layers of clothes

4753741 i was in there thinking i was just dreaming and waiting to wake up
4753742 i said thank goodness could you please get us to 95
4753743 the first thing that she said to us was no you just ran that stop sign pull over
4753744 it wasnt a big deal well pay the stop sign violation but can we have directions
4753745 what she said was you found your own way in here you can find your own way out
4753746 that really threw us for a loop when she stepped in between our cars
4753747 she said my partner is not going to step in front of me and tell you directions if im not
4753748 brooks father was in the middle of giving us directions when the officer screeched up behind us and got out of the car and asked me to step out i obeyed
4753749 i obeyed everything stepped out of the car put my hands behind my back and the next thing i know i was getting arrested for trespassing
4753750 i said maam you know we just need your help
4753751 until you deal with the attraction of deer in town more wolves would be coming on the island
4753752 the idea isnt about eliminating a species from the island but providing some control
4753753 i dont want any firearms used on the island at all this way you wont be hearing gunshots in the woods
4753754 if you have to hunt them its not a bad option because you have someone doing it for free and id rather have somebody with a bow do it than with a gun
4753755 were very concerned about the levels of incidents that we were hearing about even anecdotally
4753756 they werent scrawny wolves into peoples garbage these were big massive healthy looking wolves
4753757 i think this is really about educating people said coun kathy bedard
4753758 they are on the move now there is no way to tell where they are staying the pups are just about ready to leave their den site
4753759 if you want to walk your dog walk it at the waterfront thats where it will be safe
4753760 see them observe them and enjoy it but dont feed them or bring your dog out
4753761 they are here because we have an overabundance in deer

4753766 its important for people to know that he williams and toulon contacted us
4753767 we havent gone chasing any of this we were prepared to take the matter to court and make him accountable and still are if an agreement is not reached
4753768 a financial settlement is going to be found at the beginning of next week
4753769 the fact he has decided not to defy the injunction sends a clear message to people who want to break their contract
4753770 how long he stays on the sidelines is one of the issues that has been raised
4753771 ive said on a few occasions that the issue is that not only does his departure impact on us on the field but also off the field
4753772 an impact across the whole business current and future players supporters sponsors we need to take all that into account on the next range of discussions with toulon

4753785 a map dating back to koreas joseon dynasty 1392 1910 shows ulleungdo island and the dokdo islets
4753786 why did old korean maps show ulleungdo as two islands
4753787 historical evidence that dokdo was indeed recognized as part of korea even during koreas three kingdoms period in the 4th century
4753788 has dokdo been a part of korean territory since the sixth century
4753789 an abundance of historical data and supporting materials that would overwhelm whatever japan shows as its historical materials
4753790 the ministry of environment has reassured us that there are no conservation concerns for the deer and archery is a well used tool to provide a safe hunting opportunity on kaien island

4753803 we could have won if we would have taken more chances
4753804 that is going to be critically important because right now there is really no data to make a scientific judgment one way or the other
4753805 the information that has been put out there is really very little scientific information in there
4753806 the case is built from a number of pieces of circumstantial evidence and for a case this important its troubling to have so many loose ends the briefing pointed out even more loose ends than i thought there were before
4753807 its very hard to get the sense of whether this was scientifically good or bad we didnt really get the question settled other than taking their word for it
4753808 he played a major role in bringing black music to the masses and in the evolution of rhythm and blues to soul music
4753809 beyond that he really developed the role of the record producer jerry did a lot more than just turn on a tape recorder he left his stamp on a lot of great music he had a commercial ear as well as a critical ear
4753810 he was incredibly abrasive and incredibly generous very abrupt and very very patient seemingly a pure sharklike businessman and also a cerebral and creative genius

4753822 russias military offensive into georgia has shattered perhaps irrevocably the strategy of three successive presidential administrations to coax russia into alliance with the west and integration into its institutions

4753854 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4753861 given the woefully inadequate response by the government to the neo nazi march through the center of vilnius less than half a year ago i believe that the time has come for unequivocal resolute and immediate action to identify and punish those responsible for this anti semitic attack
4753862 there is no doubt in my mind that these outbreaks of anti jewish violence are the direct result of lithuanias failure to punish its nazi collaborators the recent campaign against soviet jewish partisans and the ongoing efforts to minimize the role of lithuanians in the mass murder of their jewish neighbors during the holocaust todays anti semitic violence is the direct result of ignoring the crimes of the past

4753881 i just had to kind of sit around it took a little time
4753882 you dont want to go out there and take it for granted
4753883 thats when you mess up like when the false start comes ive never false started in my life but it could have been that one time then im out in the first round and there go my chances
4753884 my coach wanted me to work on the blast at the beginning to get a feel for the track and if i felt good maintain it and if i cant shut it down
4753885 i was very pleased with the time because i havent been able to run races
4753886 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible

4753888 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4753889 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4753890 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4753891 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4753892 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4753893 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4753894 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4753895 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4753896 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4753897 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4753898 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4753899 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4753900 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4753901 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4753902 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4753903 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4753904 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming

4753919 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues

4754100 if the space has value which it clearly does and its donated to the officeholder or the campaign it needs to be reported
4754101 im over there and im responding to something that has to do with senate activities
4754102 i dont do campaign work out of my business office
4754103 carl just thought it was better to end the practice altogether so there wouldnt be any questions
4754104 ive heard the argument that the post tries to be a local paper in this case local also looks provincial insular and narrow minded
4754105 the stunning nature of the redskins hire the fact that it was a complete surprise to me made it a more compelling story plus we have been leading a1 with politics just about every week and this was a nice change of pace
4754106 replacing a campaign manager at this stage in the race is bigger news to me than winning one caucus the pictures were a simple decision to play clinton larger on monday because we played obama larger on sunday we want to be fair to the candidates in our visual choices
4754107 what were editors thinking about last night when it came to photo choices
4754108 conservatives yet more ammo to accuse journalists in general of having a clear liberal dem bias
4754109 the closeness of the democratic race makes that the newsier of the pieces also it was a very strong photo a candidate out in public interacting with residents in our city on election day that alone was a different image than most of these contests have given us a candidate on stage surrounded by supporters declaring victory the mccain photo came in very late on deadline it too was a good image and there was debate about playing it larger on the page we decided the obama photo was better we hurried to get mccain in and we were comfortable that we were giving it decent play
4754110 i think this is a terrible omission is the post afraid to take a stand
4754111 we have not endorsed in past presidential primaries and felt there was not a compelling reason such as one democratic candidate we overwhelmingly preferred to do so on this occasion we did publish a long editorial three sundays ago outlining the pluses and minuses of the democratic candidates and making clear that on the republican side we believed mccain was superior to the rest
4754112 i am frustrated with the news coverage we are having our primary in a week and all the news coverage is about who is winning what it just seems totally focused on election strategies and very little about what each candidate stands for
4754113 think different the webs not a place to stick your ads
4754114 the basic point about the web is that it is not an advertising medium the web is not a selling medium it is a buying medium it is user controlled so the user controls the user experiences
4754115 this hits not only those plants and workers but all the businesses and suppliers who may have been dependent on those workers and this is all working its way through the system
4754116 and other manufacturing is way down too this tracks with what we are seeing especially among blue collar jobs
4754117 total employment decreased in both goods producing and service producing industries
4754118 these are vital services to the quality of life in coshocton county
4754119 but if we dont place them on the ballot the backlash could be worse
4754120 they came to us at the 11th hour i dont think they realized there wasnt going to be a regular primary next year so it made a tough decision for us fischer said
4754121 we cant justify them spending some of their levy funds on paying for a primary
4754122 if we had a large scale tragedy like a multiple auto accident or explosion at a plant blood would be depleted fast
4754123 summer is specifically challenging because people are on vacations traveling more and doing other summer activities
4754124 but those reasons are also why this is the time we really need blood our shelves are never stocked completely full but this is a critical time in the central ohio region we need 650 units of blood every day for the hospitals and patients in 27 counties
4754125 one staggering statistic is the amount of people who dont donate
4754126 theres only a small percentage of the population that contributes thats three percent ninety seven percent dont donate because of a fear of needles or the unknown when you think about it the result of saving somebodys life overshadows the small inconvenience
4754127 my advice to people afraid to donate is to talk to someone who has given blood and i think its important to be educated about people who need and give blood
4754128 we make our own decisions about what we consider newsworthy
4754129 the nomination of the first african american presidential nominee after a bitter primary campaign and his efforts to unite a party afterward were simply more newsworthy than a candidate whose nomination was already assured and who spent much of that time raising money in the end we can and should be judged on the fairness of our coverage but that is a judgment that must be made over the course of the whole campaign not a single period of time
4754130 it should be recognized that their employment or their involvement in causes can at least appear to compromise our integrity the business and professional ties of traditional family members or other members of your household must be disclosed to department heads
4754131 i have my own opinions but i stay away from anything hes working on
4754132 i took a marriage vow in 2003 to no longer be involved in politics let alone partisan politics
4754133 we freelance for no one and accept no speaking engagements without permission from department heads
4754134 additional constraints of my own i have never spoken to partisan gatherings in any role other than a journalist nor to an advocacy group that lobbies congress or the federal government virtually all of the speeches i have made have been to college or civic audiences
4754135 i am embarrassed by these mistakes and the embarrassment it has caused the paper broder said
4754136 fuzzy and ambiguous the question is where does the money go i dont keep the money its a straight shot into the foundation that gives money to legitimate charities i think thats doing good work my wife and i made a commitment to do this
4754137 there were many mercenaries from ukraine and the baltic states we have found dead bodies of african americans too
4754138 it was a well prepared and thought out action when there was only one opinion provided the opinion of the usa great britain and several other countries everyone started to support this opinion
4754139 the windows in the stores were all decorated and we would walk up and down main and look in the windows
4754140 it was fun i liked it over in roscoe village too it was a good fit but im willing to give this a chance
4754141 you can see we have some similarities we also have some differences but we do believe that its important because these happened within the same five blocks
4754142 im not looking for any new job im running for re election
4754143 if i was bi lingual id say no in multiple languages the only job john kerry is running for contemplating or considering is the one he already has
4754144 i want to say that i was running from georgian troops bombing the city
4754145 i want to say thank you to the russian troops that were helping us out
4754146 along with michael wilbon shapiro took a very sad day and made it stunningly sadder there was no place for an article like that on the day that sean taylor lost his life it was an affront to mr taylor his family the washington redskins and the thousands of fans who mourned his loss
4754147 still could anyone honestly say they never saw this coming youd have to be blind not to considering taylors checkered past
4754148 taylor grew up in a violent world embraced it claimed it loved to run in it and refused to divorce himself from it he aint the first and wont be the last we have no idea what happened or if what we know now will be revised later its sad yes but hardly surprising
4754149 a 24 year old young man has died he is not yet buried and already mr shapiro is saying we should have seen it coming public figure or not these are not appropriate comments about any person on the day that he died
4754150 in retrospect i would have worded it a bit differently softened it a little bit im not a callous or uncaring person maybe i didnt say it very elegantly i feel very badly if people interpreted
4754151 she made me wait a day she was probably right on that
4754152 those exact words should have been uttered in precisely that form
4754153 any change of any comment put within quotation marks is an ethical breach
4754154 i just dont see the reason for quoting someone verbatim unless it adds something to the story
4754155 i dont know how nobody feel i dont know what nobody think i dont know what nobody doing the only thing i know is whats going on in clinton portiss life
4754156 isnt it possible that portis speaks this way on purpose to maintain a persona as a dude from the hood
4754157 ill wager that he could speak standard english if he wanted to he chooses instead the colorful nonstandard english that is common in african american communities thats his choice and his choice should be respected
4754158 the larger point is that people even very educated ones almost never speak according to the conventions of standard written grammar
4754159 what does exact mean does it mean we are compelled to include every momentary digression every cough or mid sentence sneeze and every little illiteracy or word choice imprecision that someone might utter in the course of answering a question i dont think so i think we are held to several responsibilities as journalists and sometimes these rub up against each other a little bit we are supposed to tell the truth as best we can we are also supposed to be clear and concise and communicate thoughts efficiently i think our responsibility to write clearly and compellingly requires us to be more than just a tape recorder
4754160 before we were told to quote the person as exactly as possible and above all to get the sense of what was said then we got tape recorders the exact quote was possible but with the exact quote we sometimes lost the sense of what was said because the hesitations and digressions in the quote steered readers away from the context
4754161 there is also the problem of quoting someone who is trying to speak in english though it is not their first language we try never to embarrass a person unnecessarily by quoting them directly using incorrect grammar or misplaced negatives the exceptions are long narratives where broken english might more accurately convey someones struggle or thinking but again does not unnecessarily embarrass them bottom line we never ever change words in a quote that could change the meaning or intent
4754162 quotes should accurately and authentically reflect the words used in an interview if we start changing words inside quote marks then we raise questions about all other quotes we will increase the distrust factor about the veracity of our journalism
4754163 perhaps the greatest challenge in copy editing is reading 1 000 sophisticated words on a complex topic and finding six words to tell the story and convey its nuance and tone often with less than five minutes to do so
4754164 capture the essence and tone of the story as well as the most important element
4754165 invite readers into the story use vivid words avoid headlinese and deadening bureaucratic language whenever possible headlines should be written in understandable conversational english
4754166 all those short words that you see only in headlines rips flays nabs blasts dems oks the post is pretty good about avoiding those
4754167 was sympathetic and glorified an infamous and deadly terrorist organization the pkk was portrayed as humane fighters in an epic struggle despite the fact they have been engaging in brutal terrorism they are indiscriminate in who they kill including anyone trying to bring services to the region teachers engineers doctors they are criminals heavily involved in drug trafficking arms extortion and money laundering
4754168 i dont understand why a terrorist is carrying a baby milk bottle
4754169 exactly the kind of story any journalist would like to have had
4754170 you get propaganda statements that is the way they talk
4754171 it tended to romanticize people who have done some pretty awful things
4754172 wow good for you guys for doing it the reporter was describing what he sees i took it as such
4754173 there was no context but not every piece is going to go through a litany of charges for someone like me who is well versed we dont get to see much about how these guys operate how they bury their dead why theyre so difficult to defeat purely for information that i hadnt seen for a long long time it was a very useful piece
4754174 i dont think the piece is biased it obviously has some sympathy for the guerrillas but also gives background enough to balance
4754175 what does not come through is the pkk has a very nasty past of killing schoolteachers and tourists and anyone who tries to leave the pkk
4754176 i believe the story had the appropriate degree of historical perspective for what it was designed to do as well as fresh context derived from our rare visit and firsthand look at this group its also important to remember that this piece was just one chapter in a running story about the pkk turkey and iraqi kurds that we had been covering extensively in the prior weeks and will be in the months ahead
4754177 the post would be inaccurate to necessarily call araujo gay the crucial issue is that as a woman she could be either gay or heterosexual if shes attracted to men shes heterosexual
4754178 this is a distinct difference between gender and sexual orientation they are independent of each other just because someone is transgender doesnt mean someone is gay
4754179 menopausal women who took estrogen and progesterone faced a small increased risk of cancer for more than two years after they stopped
4754180 because progestin is a form of progesterone and my thinking was that progesterone is a more familiar term to most readers
4754181 used interchangeably its technically wrong and whi did not use progesterone in the study
4754182 learned nothing new of any importance that could not have been fully reported in a single news story
4754183 the articles discussing him really should have noted clearly and at the top that in the end basically no evidence was found implicating him in any foul play
4754184 as the mother of two teenage daughters i am very thankful that the washington post has so thoroughly reviewed the case and placed the resultant stories prominently on the front page the parents of the young woman believed that their daughter would return home safely and failing that the parents wanted to trust that those responsible for killing their only daughter would be brought to justice they are still waiting and so is the public
4754185 if your series on chandra levy doesnt win some sort of prestigious award it will be a crime this is by far and away some of the best writing ive ever read in the post you should be proud of this one its so intriguing and riveting
4754186 pulitzer recognition is a universally understood measure of a newspapers reputation yet its also more its a signal that heres a paper that nurtures encourages and empowers its writers this signal helps attract the best in the field and this cannot help but be a boon to the everyday readers
4754187 got inside this closed brotherhood of hired guns and found a billion dollar industry running wild
4754188 the newspapers duty is to its readers and to the public at large and not to the private interests of its owners
4754189 in the pursuit of truth the newspaper shall be prepared to make sacrifices of its material fortunes if such a course be necessary for the public good
4754190 the biggest change is the volume of information that flows back and forth among the campaigns and the speed at which it moves were now in a continuous news cycle capturing all this and trying to make sense of it requires more than just newspaper stories and video increasingly is a way to provide immediacy and intimacy to our report we are all adapting to the new reality
4754191 virtually everyone is producing more for the web i look at it as a matter of self preservation if im going to make it to retirement in this business it has to be on the web tv and radio and writing books you cant just depend on the newspaper anymore
4754192 if the media didnt have independent polls they would have to live off the polls the campaigns take and only get what the campaigns want you to see
4754193 the public with a more comprehensive and accurate portrayal of public opinion and at critical junctures as a reality check for the media when they prematurely and inaccurately pronounce what conventional wisdom is emanating from the american public
4754194 are more effective at creating public opinion than accurately measuring public opinion
4754195 lots of speculation that polls affect elections but ive seen little evidence of that or that coverage is better without them polls elucidate whats going on more than pundits spouting off voters are smart and make decisions by and large in their own interests and dont seem to be overly influenced by poll numbers
4754196 the goal is always to be as useful as possible to the broader coverage
4754197 is supposed to extrapolate a conclusion for 220 million adults
4754198 yes according to statistical and probability theory if the right methods are used to choose the sample of people stripped of statistics speak sampling the population is like testing the temperature of a bowl of soup you dont need to eat the whole thing just stir it up and taste a spoonful or two or like taking a blood sample no need to drain the patient dry a syringeful will do
4754199 most evidence shows that the lack of cellphones does not bias our estimates of national public opinion
4754200 listen pal i spent 22 years in the navy my grandfather was in the navy we in the military service tend to move a lot we have to live in all parts of the country all parts of the world i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
4754201 the most devastating response to a potentially troublesome political issue ive ever heard
4754202 i am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponents youth and inexperience
4754203 id encourage more youth and teens to come to events by using tools like myspace and the internet
4754204 i have been wracking my brain i cant think of an instance in a political campaign that the democratic and republican nominees appear side by side in a church
4754205 this is unique in a couple of respects they are in a church hosted by a pastor and both are there
4754206 hurricane katrina was in fact the judgment of god against the city of new orleans
4754207 both see an opportunity in mccains case to show up and strengthen support among evangelicals and with obama to try to make inroads with evangelical voters
4754208 represent the antithesis of not to mention supreme american values
4754209 he is the poster child of the new generation of evangelical leadership that has a broader political agenda than gay marriage and other social
4754210 the lines separating the parties and particularly as it relates to these two candidates are shifting and this voting bloc that had been extremely solidly republican is more and more up for grabs
4754211 you cant charge a premium for a title that is in some degree less functional than a standard def title
4754212 blu ray is the highest quality source of video content available and having a 1080p setup will ensure that you are capitalizing on all the fine picture details that blu ray provides
4754213 ive heard people say that having a blu ray player without a 1080p tv is like having a ferrari without tires
4754214 just because you have a shelby instead of a ferrari doesnt mean you shouldnt buy yourself a set of tires if you have a 720p tv run to the store and get yourself a blu ray player
4754215 my ps3 has never had an audio glitch or playback problem and sony keeps updating it with firmware to show they are committed to making it the best it is overall the best bd player money can buy in my opinion
4754216 for 5 000 youd better have a better product than the ones for 400
4754217 i think a lot of it right now is going to deal with brand and brand reputation more than anything which isnt to say that more expensive products arent technically better than cheaper products or that cheaper products are necessarily worse but brand plays a huge role
4754218 the post has hit rock bottom with todays picture of hilton on the front page partly above the fold followed by a story in style if the post wants to run these stories to appeal to some demographic it should have a separate section devoted to grocery store checkout stuff
4754219 the paris hilton saga speaks to our character as a celebrity soaked culture which is why so many people find something to say about it and why it deserved some place on a1 a picture key to the style piece seemed right i dont think we lost our heads
4754220 we do have a two tiered system of justice paris hilton with the help of lawyers was thumbing her nose at the courts
4754221 you cant really blame al gore for not using footnotes in his new book the assault on reason its a sprawling untidy blast of indignation and annotating it with footnotes would be like trying to slip rubber bands around a puddle of quicksilver
4754222 mr fergusons entire column is based on a falsehood i trust that a correction is forthcoming
4754223 im mortified about this it was incredibly stupid how i missed them is inexplicable
4754224 by hosting these poland is making itself a target this is 100 per cent certain it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4754225 the deployment of new missile defence facilities in europe is aimed against the russian federation
4754226 the cold war is over bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4754227 with the signature of the georgian president on this cease fire accord all russian troops and any irregular and paramilitary forces that entered with them must leave immediately
4754228 the europeans have received a dead cat from the americans
4754229 logical to deploy u s missile defense elements on natos southern flanks in turkey bulgaria and romania
4754230 the poles should be thanked for helping reveal the strategic goal of the u s missile defense plan
4754231 my editors and i were so shocked we couldnt believe it was true i called my sources back and grilled them before we put it on the web
4754232 one of the hardest most important things we had to do was make sure there was no overlap among the stories we were doing to keep each story tightly focused
4754233 a primordial act you dont want to find the kid in the dorm across the street or the hall you want to find the kid who was in the room with him
4754234 then reporter jose antonio vargas reached a kid whod been inside one of the classrooms that was the first real idea we had of what the terror was like and who the shooter mightve been young asian nonverbal two guns
4754235 it is not something one would expect from a great newspaper
4754236 stories pack far more power and more meaning when we spurn the official language of journalism and instead let peoples emotions cry out
4754237 it is hard to read the vertical half page nothing to hold onto and hard to change from page to page in the section in the big scheme of things this is just a minor irritant but you and others have wondered why readership and subscriptions are down minor annoyances may play a role
4754238 those new half pages the wpost is now using ugh what a pain theres probably some get you to read it theory behind them but please find a way to fill two pages or cut back
4754239 to hold or fold the half width page or turn it without putting the paper down or going through contortions would require a third hand something few of us come equipped with please make them stop
4754240 at a time when newspapers are complaining about loss of readership i would think the post would want to do everything it could to make it easier not harder to read the paper i would rather you raise my rates and put back the full page s
4754241 i know it saves a little newsprint but i get so annoyed every time i see one of the half pages i dont think it can be saving enough to make it worth the wrath of post readers
4754242 the trade off of more content and a better balanced section is worth it
4754243 weve been experimenting with the half pages as a way of maintaining the amount of space were devoting to journalism in these sections when the amount of advertising fluctuates in the past weve filled any holes on pages with house ads a wasteful approach that doesnt serve readers or our economics were attentive to readers views of these pages and are still looking for ways to make them be more useful and less weird
4754244 i completely understand readers frustration with these new half sheet pages in fact i share them as a reader
4754245 paper is one of the costliest aspects of putting the newspaper out and as newspapers seek to cut costs in order to continue to invest in the content we produce using half pages when we dont have stories or ads to fill them seemed like one of the easier things we could do that said we will keep an eye on how readers feel about them and will reconsider if it is pushing our readers away
4754246 as a lifelong reader of the washington post and a journalist i was disappointed that about 20 percent of the front page of the posts business section was devoted to an advertisement rather than editorial content i realize that a number of other newspapers including usa today have run ads on their section fronts for quite a while but i was always pleased that the post had resisted the urge to sacrifice editorial quality for short term profit i urge you to reconsider your decision great newspapers like the post shouldnt take any such actions that compromise their editorial quality
4754247 we held off on doing them for some time for reasons you expressed at the end of the day i made the call to go ahead and take these ads with their premium revenue as you note newspapers these days are under growing pressure to find new revenue streams in order to support the news gathering and maintain the best possible quality for readers
4754248 so there was no net loss to readers in the overall long term tradeoff i dont think readers will be confused or disadvantaged except for the aesthetics
4754249 we dont like their sound and guitar music is on the way out
4754250 obviously i wish id gotten the number right which changed in the days between the raid and when the editorial ran
4754251 older readers enjoy them the comics and dont have access to the internet
4754252 the weird old soap operas including mary worth are my favorite target

4754263 there is more than enough blame to go around to both parties
4754264 we had no way we could find out whether the potential bidders had the funds or funding for a proposed purchase
4754265 as there were over 500 emails from various people this week this has been a very tiresome process for one
4754266 he was a loveable lad who was never really in trouble
4754267 he was respectful but there had been trouble at this party
4754268 someone told me that connor was thought to have said something to someone which he denied it all then got out of hand and there was a commotion and he ended up getting stabbed
4754269 he wasnt the sort of lad who would look for trouble but he would back himself up
4754270 we are at the early stages of this inquiry but we believe there may have been witnesses who could assist our investigation into finding out what happened

4754275 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4754276 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4754277 the key is whether the legislature has the right to inform the public of sex offenders living in the community
4754278 the intent of the legislature was not to provide punishment but to provide a civil remedial action
4754279 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4754280 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4754281 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4754282 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4754283 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4754284 based on the unanimous passage of this legislation through both chambers of the nevada legislature it would be hard to assume anyone foresaw the constitutional challenges the law is currently facing
4754285 still governor gibbons would much rather sign aggressive laws protecting the people of nevada from sexual predators than wait to see how other states handle federal legislation and see whether the courts agree with it
4754286 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4754287 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community
4754288 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately

4754292 is it possible for us to witness a world without america and zionism
4754293 today people are not happy with the state of the world injustice wars and insecurity have taken peace away from the world brutality dominates human relations and its reasons are inappropriate moves of big countries
4754294 ready to fight against brutal force everywhere in the world
4754295 we will be happy as much as occupied lands are saved zionist regime is an artificial regime created by bringing people from other parts of the world and committing massacres zionist regime is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and miserable conditions of 5 million people
4754296 ottomans acted as a barrier to this wave but when the ottoman government collapsed attacks against the region started we need to solve the deep rooted problems of the middle east in the last 60 years three major wars broke out because of the zionist regime
4754297 we will fully support the break up frankly it is about time
4754298 this is the first call of cthulhu product published under our license with chaosium inc

4754314 sometimes you can be pleasantly surprised when something quite unsuitable looking turns out to be very comfortable i was not surprised it was indeed quite uncomfortable
4754315 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me
4754316 i get blamed for everything from global warming to high petrol prices in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at aston villa
4754317 all the talks have been between our chief executive rick parry the owner and the chief executive of aston villa those talks have all been pretty good
4754318 if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa as i have said those talks i understand have been good
4754319 i was not involved in the talks about barry and i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal
4754320 if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions
4754321 if you want to talk about players then you talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then you talk with me

4754324 this is going to be big i just know it and afterwards well be back on track just like we were before
4754325 sure the show will be great but as long as youre talking about afterwards um
4754326 some of us have been thinking about the direction the band is going maybe this is a good time to talk about it
4754327 we all want to play hard rock and thats what were doing musically i still think were the best band in the city
4754328 were seeing what a lot of other bands are doing right now and its making it very apparent what were not doing like all the internet stuff that lady endorphin does
4754329 shit the old timey railroad band has a couple hundred friends already and they havent even played a gig yet theyve also recorded several songs to put online and in the four or five years that you guys have been together youve recorded just a notch above jack shit
4754330 no im just saying that theyre tuned in to contemporary methods of promotion
4754331 this is a big part of finding fans now theyre just doing their band for fun but theyre already more organized than we are you guys say that youre serious about making it but you clearly have no idea about how to get your music heard
4754332 weve always had a band philosophy that the music comes first we have good songs and we play good shows thats the most important thing
4754333 we keep saying that were better than them but if thats true why the fuck are they getting signed and were not
4754334 i dont think you want to admit that theyre running their band better than we are
4754335 i think after we get new gear we need to spend some time refocusing
4754336 weve got a lot of great songs but we need to figure out what kind of band we want to be if we want to tour around indiana and make some dough we can do that we can be a good local band but if we want to go further and you know really get somewhere i think well need to make some changes
4754337 look at this show this is the biggest thing weve ever really done were working together with all these other bands were getting people to come up on stage with us were renting proper lighting rigs and weve recorded a track and put it online i think were turning a corner
4754338 the funny thing is we wouldnt have done any of this stuff if our gear hadnt have gotten jacked
4754339 its easy to say but we need to figure out what to do
4754340 and then after your slightly insane rant against allsystemsgo on the radio last thursday were just i dont know i guess were just worried about you you know worried youre getting a bit stressed out
4754341 but im not really surprised youve been a little crazy lately
4754342 well is it any wonder shit no gear parents splitting i have to get an apartment and a new job while putting this show together of course im stressed come on lets just get going
4754343 the strap is all sweaty i can feel it through my shirt
4754344 youre alone again is that crazy bitch ever coming or what

4754352 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4754353 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4754354 i am amazed appalled and highly offended by it global warming it is a scam
4754355 new jerseys tax and regulatory climate is already chasing jobs from this state left and right and these new regulations will make matters worse
4754356 rather than conforming our policies to questionable scientific theories we should be looking at the concrete economic indicators that show our states economy is in trouble and we should be taking steps to

4754363 republican presidential candidate john mccain continued hammering russia on tuesday for its invasion of u s allied georgia telling a cheering audience that he had spoken again with the tiny caucasus countrys president to assure him of americas moral support
4754364 natos decision to withhold a membership action plan for georgia might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia and i urge the nato allies to revisit the decision
4754365 i have consistently called for deepening relations between georgia and trans atlantic institutions including a membership action plan for nato and we must continue to press for that deeper relationship
4754366 russias military offensive into georgia has shattered perhaps irrevocably the strategy of three successive presidential administrations to coax russia into alliance with the west and integration into its institutions
4754367 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4754385 pure and undefiled religion before god and the father is this to visit orphans and widows in their trouble and to keep oneself unspotted from the world
4754386 i keep asking that the god of our lord jesus christ the glorious father may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation so that you may know him better i pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints and his incomparably great power for us who believe that power is like the working of his mighty strength which he exerted in christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms
4754387 if this is gods true church then maybe i have been deceived

4754390 therefore i urge you brothers in view of gods mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices holy and pleasing to god this is your spiritual act of worship

4754493 given that theres the investigation and the obvious impact of the explosion its fairly obvious to anyone that thats not going to take place
4754494 our vehicles are designed to not have any leakage and if we are aware of any one particular problem we would have that vehicle serviced
4754495 we probably want to take a look at the individual route
4754496 i have no idea where it comes from and why it happens
4754497 weve had some complaints mainly in kensington market this week
4754498 with trucks leaving a fairly healthy residue on the street
4754499 in the summer it has such a nasty smell and then you get the flies
4754500 where the back tailgate meets up with the body with the truck there is a seal there but it does in time break down
4754501 ive never seen a garbage truck that didnt leak juice
4754502 in terms of a health hazard i dont get the context there
4754503 people arent typically eating on the road or playing on the road
4754504 if you have a truck which is picking up garbage and there is compaction taking place and someone has thrown some toxic waste something like batteries in their garbage that would be hazardous
4754505 if the truck is picking up green waste then i dont worry about it would i eat a carrot stick that fell in it no
4754506 but then i wouldnt eat anything that fell on the road period
4754507 we couldnt have picked a better band for this party

4754509 im just hoping for a chance to meet mary wilson
4754510 thats when i was in my mood already i have to take some video of whats going on
4754511 in the absence of mainstream media representations of the stories i think an online conversation of sorts occurred with various people in the neighbourhood doing as i did
4754512 then a viral effect occurred where other youtubers started to respond to other videos with their own video coverage from increasingly closer and interestingly more higher resolution
4754513 i was there before any of the camera crews and before the cops arrived
4754514 it was like an accomplishment that i was there taking video making people see it
4754515 the very best video shots of the explosions and subsequent fires came from viewers
4754516 they didnt come from the camera people at news organizations
4754517 we never said send us it just started to happen the floodgate opened
4754518 you have two million people out there providing you input and providing you feedback obviously your coverage is going to be that much better
4754519 last time i checked there were like 23 000 views
4754520 my initial idea was to go and possibly help also i had the idea i could do a video and make a little money
4754521 these people have a really great need to share their videos their photos and their stories and they picked us they couldve shared them on youtube and they dont get paid for that
4754522 it sounded like a anti air cannon discharging from a distance like one you hear in those war zone reports

4754524 our approach is unique in the world no one else has yet developed customized immunotherapy using the virus from individual patients
4754525 this experimental technique remains long and costly for the moment but were hoping it will hold the promise of a completely innovative and widely available treatment in the future
4754526 at this stage we have shown that the technique doesnt cause side effects or an undesirable auto immune response
4754527 madonna had serious reservations about the marriage and about guy and expressed them to christopher in the letter
4754528 there were details about guys past and madonnas insecurities the letter took my breath away it showed me how bright she was and the woman behind the madonna constructed image
4754529 she madonna detailed her marriage to guy in a way that a woman usually doesnt discuss her husband with her brother it showed a side of her that made her very human
4754530 but think that this was so soon in the marriage she was having grave doubts but so was he the separation was initiated by him

4754572 obama always acknowledged his stepfather was muslim though he did his best to downplay islam as an important force in his stepfathers life
4754573 the grandparents who helped raise mr obama were nonpracticing baptists and methodists his mother was an anthropologist who collected religious texts the way others picked up tribal masks teaching her children the inspirational power of the common narratives and heroes his mothers tutelage took place mostly in indonesia in the household of mr obamas stepfather lolo soetoro a nominal muslim who hung prayer beads over his bed but enjoyed bacon which islam forbids

4754615 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry liverpool chief executive or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good

4754660 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4754661 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4754674 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4754675 i was in high school when she hit it big
4754676 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4754677 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4754678 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4754679 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4754680 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4754681 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4754682 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4754683 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4754684 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4754685 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4754686 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4754687 im sure shes happy to be an inspiration to women and men of any age
4754688 is not quite the benchmark for her as it seems to be in the media who have been talking about her 50th since she turned 40
4754689 i am honoured to have been selected by the party to stand for election again in the caerphilly constituency where i was brought up and continue to live
4754690 this is the seventh time i have contested the general election seat but it illustrates that i am a determined fighter who never gives up
4754691 if you want to represent a place you have to love it live in it and care for it
4754692 its only then you can speak with compassion and thats what i intend to do
4754693 i am convinced that people living in the constituency want an alternative to a labour government in westminster which has let them down
4754694 people in this area are struggling with their food energy and fuel costs and we have had very little action from the labour government or labour mps to help families and individuals

4754715 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual any disruption by any athlete in particular a medallist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play
4754716 it should be noted that in front of the disciplinary commission the athlete never expressed any regret nor did he offer any apology for his actions
4754717 he actually did vote on march 13 2003 in the senate health and human services committee to approve the illinois born alive act which was the same as the federal law then he voted it down
4754718 he is the most pro abortion senator even naral went neutral on the federal born alive infant protection act
4754719 since then we have found two separate documents proving barack obama has been misrepresenting facts
4754720 in fact barack obama is more liberal than any u s senator voting against identical language of a bill that body passed unanimously 98 0 in fact barack obama condones infanticide
4754721 newly obtained documents prove that in 2003 barack obama as chairman of an illinois state senate committee voted down a bill to protect live born survivors of abortion even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language copied from a federal bill passed by congress without objection in 2002 explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion obamas legislative actions in 2003 denying effective protection even to babies born alive during abortions were contrary to the position taken on the same language by even the most liberal members of congress the bill obama killed was virtually identical to the federal bill that even naral ultimately did not oppose
4754722 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this section
4754723 the bill passed without a dissenting vote in either house of congress
4754724 obama said that had he been in the u s senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal the federal version was approved the state version was not
4754725 the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade the 1973 u s supreme court opinion that legalized abortion
4754726 nrlc and other pro life observers have always regarded obamas defense as contrived since the original two paragraph baipa on its face applied only after a live birth the neutrality clause added in 2001 merely made this explicit and therefore the new clause did not change the substance of the original bill
4754727 less than two years after this meeting obama began to publicly claim that he opposed the state baipa because it lacked the neutrality clause and that he would have supported the federal version had he been a member of congress because it contained the neutrality clause

4754731 oregon voters deserve to be heard on this referendum more than enough oregonians signed the petitions for it the people didnt thwart this effort government bureaucracy did that is a dangerous precedent for the future of the democratic process in america
4754732 although regulations on the referendum process implicate the fundamental right to vote the states important interests justify the minimal burden on plaintiffs rights
4754733 no county gave notice to voters with rejected signatures the counties also refused to consider extrinsic evidence presented by voters
4754734 oregons important interests justify this minimal burden on the right to vote

4754750 i am a christian im a devout christian i have been a member of the same church for 20 years i pray to jesus every night
4754751 kneeling beneath that cross on the south side i felt that i heard gods spirit beckoning me
4754752 i submitted myself to his will and dedicated myself to discovering his truth
4754753 most americans tell us in polls that they would not be comfortable voting for an islamic candidate for president
4754754 there are other groups that people wouldnt feel comfortable voting for as well so to the extent some americans believe that senator obama is a muslim or of muslim background that could create a problem
4754755 hes very interested in pursuing religious voters john mccain is little bit stand offish hes not that happy and that comfortable talking about that subject
4754756 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain
4754757 on christmas that same guard approached me and without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
4754758 i will never forget that no matter where you are no matter how difficult the circumstances there will always be someone who will pick you up
4754759 we have to remember that the 2004 election was very very close
4754760 if we had an election that was that close again just a small shift in these voting blocks could make a difference
4754761 so senator obama does not need to win a majority of the white evangelical vote if he could do as much as 30 per cent of that vote all other things being equal he could be in pretty good shape to win the white house
4754762 senator mccain has certainly not lost the evangelical vote but hes having some trouble getting the same level of support president bush has and he may not be able to do that simply because he doesnt have the kind of tie to the evangelical community that george bush has
4754763 there has been a tendency to overstate the influence of evangelical voters
4754764 this is a very important group but it is not the determinative group in american politics
4754765 there is still a great deal of unease among jewish voters with regard to senator obama
4754766 some of it has to do with his foreign policy issues where theyre not sure how strong a friend he is of israel despite the fact that he has of course argued that he really is
4754767 we know this is a war between the west and russia
4754768 our athletes are often more psychologically fragile than foreign athletes

4754780 working like hymn writers families may emphasize certain parts of their experience in their stories and leave out others based on what is meaningful in that experience for the family family storytellers digress to add drama or exaggerate to underline what is important the story takes on a subtle rhythm that almost resembles music once told the story becomes part of the family repertoire perhaps to be told again and again even more important by giving the family experience this shape the story becomes a shared source of identity that will be remembered long after other unstoried experiences are forgotten

4754812 threat of world aids pandemic among heterosexuals is over report admits
4754813 t here will be no generalised epidemic of aids in the heterosexual population outside africa
4754814 a 25 year health campaign was misplaced outside the continent of africa
4754815 but the disease still kills more than all wars and conflicts
4754816 any revision of the threat was liable to be seized on by those who rejected hiv as the cause of the disease
4754817 sir in the may 9 issue of the lancet round the world correspondents discussed aids associated problems in former eastern bloc countries i would like to emphasize another alarming concern namely the rapid growth in false positive ussr and in russia especially in 1990 of 20 2 million hiv tests done in russia only 12 were confirmed and about 20 000 were false positives 1991 saw some 30 000 false positives out of 29 4 million tests with only 66 confirmations
4754818 at present there is no recognized standard for establishing the presence or absence of antibodies to hiv 1 and hiv 2 in human blood
4754819 persons at risk of hiv 1 infection have been classified incorrectly as hiv therapy not to diagnose hiv infection in patients like ours with a low prior probability of disease almost all positive test results are false positive
4754820 is correlated to hiv plasma viral load and successful deworming is associated with a significant decrease in hiv plasma viral load
4754821 the problems is that all the sero surveillance data came from pregnant women and estimates for other demographics was based on that
4754822 suppose for example a single rapid test that has 99 4 specificity is administered to 1 000 people meaning six will test false positive that error rate wont matter much in areas with a high prevalence of hiv because in all probability the people testing false positive will have the disease
4754823 whereas once it was seen as a risk to populations everywhere it was now recognised that outside sub saharan africa it was confined to high risk groups including men who have sex with men injecting drug users and sex workers and their clients
4754824 we followed up 175 hiv discordant couples one partner tests positive one negative over time for a total of approximately 282 couple years of follow up no transmission of hiv occurred among the 25 of couples who did not use their condoms consistently nor among the 47 couples who intermittently practiced unsafe sex during the entire duration of follow up
4754825 this study involved a group of repeatedly exposed but persistently seronegative female prostitutes in the gambia west africa have worked as prostitutes for more than five years use condoms infrequently with clients and only rarely with their regular partners and have a high incidence of other sexually transmitted diseases
4754826 in nairobi a group of prostitutes appear to have natural immunity against h i v because they have an abnormally large number of killer t cells
4754827 in order to determine whether prostitutes operating outside of areas of high drug abuse have equally elevated rates of infection 354 prostitutes were surveyed in tijuana mexico none of the 354 blood samples was positive for hiv 1 or hiv 2 condoms were used by 59 of prostitutes but for less than half of their sexual contacts infection with hiv was not found in this prostitute population despite the close proximity to neighboring san diego ca which has a high incidence of diagnosed cases of aids and to los angeles which has a reported 4 prevalence of hiv infection in prostitutes
4754828 hiv infection in non drug using prostitutes tends to be low or absent implying that sexual activity does not place them at high risk while prostitutes who use intravenous drugs are far more likely to be infected with hiv other prostitute studies tend to be small but similarly emphasize the central role of drug use as a major risk factor in new york city 50 per cent of 12 drug users were positive compared with 7 per cent of 65 nonusers in italy 59 per cent of 22 drug users were positive whereas none of the nonusers were none of the 50 prostitutes tested in london 56 in paris or 399 in nuremberg were seropositive
4754829 hiv is not an equal opportunity disease it picks and chooses its victims in a devious manner that we dont yet fully understand
4754830 but with another few billion dollars were sure to find out
4754831 its a well known fact that these high risk groups all
4754832 the mechanism by which hiv selects only perverts prossies primates and poor people of colour is as much a mystery to me as origami
4754833 were right were right were always right even when were wrong were right so there
4754834 it is very unlikely there will be a heterosexual epidemic in countries outside sub saharan africa
4754835 hiv wasnt going to rage through the billions in the general population and we knew it
4754836 there is no good evidence that aids is likely to spread rapidly in the west among heterosexuals
4754837 oh now its just gays and poor black africans the moneys going to dry up you heartless bastards
4754838 in order to determine whether prostitutes operating outside of areas of high drug abuse have equally elevated rates of infection 354 prostitutes were surveyed in tijuana mexico none of the 354 blood samples from female prostitutes was positive for hiv 1 or hiv 2 the female prostitutes mean age 29 years range 18 49 had been active prostitutes for an average of 4 2 years and reported an average of 4 1 partners per week condoms were used by 59 of prostitutes but for less than half of their sexual contacts only 4 female prostitutes 1 admitted to ever having used intravenous drugs infection with hiv was not found in this prostitute population despite the close proximity to neighboring san diego ca which has a high incidence of diagnosed cases of aids and to los angeles which has a reported 4 prevalence of hiv infection in prostitutes
4754839 among the main reasons dissenters cite in favour of their movement is skewed health funding especially in developing countries
4754840 it is no longer heresy to point out that far too much is spent on hiv relative to other needs and that this is damaging health systems although hiv causes 3 7 of mortality it receives 25 of international healthcare aid and a big chunk of domestic expenditure hiv aid often exceeds total domestic health budgets themselves
4754841 the health policy of the country is being controlled by international donors can you believe that the entire health budget of india is less than the amount of international funding the country receives on hiv
4754842 there are many examples of bad medical advice becoming dogma due to the power of senior medical people the dogma of aids has resulted in hopelessness and despair caused by the stigma of hiv status
4754843 we think there must have been some sort of nipple tweak in the space time continuum when we left him here yesterday afternoon he was his usual pusillanimous self and quite happy to be left in charge of his macaques overnight we have to wonder whether this latest un admission of high level mendacity hasnt pushed him over the edge that and the fact that his microbicide funding is at risk macaques as you know are stubbornly heterosexual and never black
4754844 well it was going to happen at some stage wasnt it i mean one cant fiddle with primates day in day out and not expect some form of divine retribution not that im one of those loony creationistconspiracytheory nutjob types
4754845 its soch e shime he relly luvd his wark and he nevver let phallure standing in his way of porblication not many hiv reseechers would do that yu knaw eeh thunk this laytest un admishun jest mayd hem verry afrad hee is alzo perzunna non gratta on hiz oen wibsight aidsfruit org
4754846 never liked the pommie fart anyway but dont worry well make good use of him
4754847 first it was in the interests of aids researchers in developed countries
4754848 second there may have been an inclination to emphasize sexual transmission as an argument for condom promotion coinciding with pre existing programmes and efforts to curb africas rapid population growth
4754849 third the role of sexual promiscuity in the spread of aids in africa
4754850 let it be sexual how health care transmission of aids in africa was ignored
4754851 if i could get everyone at the who meeting in bangui to agree on
4754852 unaids is apparently concerned that support to aids programs might be reduced if hiv remains concentrated in the highest hiv risk populations
4754853 unaids is apparently concerned that support to aids programs might be reduced if hiv remains concentrated in the highest hiv risk populations
4754854 and thus i clothe my naked villany with odd old ends stoln out of holy writ and seem a saint when most i play the devil
4754855 come lets away to prison we two alone will sing like birds i th cage
4754856 according to report author professor james chin unaids has exaggerated the size and trend of the aids pandemic and has over hyped the potential for hiv in general heterosexual populations outside of sub saharan africa
4754857 hiv estimates whether they are based on household surveys or surveys of pregnant women need to be assessed critically as the epidemic evolves
4754858 we cant test the actual people we say are infected
4754859 unaids issuing death sentences all over africa is our duty
4754860 fearful about hiv infections jumping out from these foci of infection to spread into the general population
4754861 excluded from the mainstream of society or being discriminated on grounds of race religion or sexual preference led to an increase of hiv infection
4754862 aids will cut through asian populations like a hot knife through cold butter
4754863 hiv is a major disease in southern africa but it is not a global catastrophe and language from a top unaids official that describes it as one of the make or break forces of this century and a potential threat to the survival and well being of people worldwide is sensationalist
4754864 worldwide the number of deaths from hiv each year is about the same as that among children aged under five years in india
4754865 far too much is spent on hiv relative to other needs and that this is damaging health systems
4754866 hiv exceptionalism is dead and the writing is on the wall for unaids
4754867 why a un agency for hiv and not for pneumonia or diabetes which both kill more people
4754868 unaids should be closed down rapidly not because it has performed badly given its mandate which it has not but because its mandate is wrong and harmful
4754869 its technical functions should be refitted into the world health organisation to be balanced with those for other diseases
4754870 malnutrition was another strong independent predictor of mortality in our study estimated one year mortality was nearly 50 among patients with severe malnutrition previously studies from industrialized countries have shown that malnutrition in hiv infection is associated with morbidity and mortality even after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in the late 1990s 30 32 more recently studies from developing countries have found that malnutrition is an independent predictor of mortality in patients starting art 8 12 13 33 however it is not clear whether targeted therapy for malnutrition will result in improved survival 34 studies of nutritional interventions in hiv patients are urgently needed in developing countries where malnutrition is often a result of poverty and food insecurity

4754905 the biggest seller we have is turtle poop its chocolate covered peanuts
4754906 we have cashew turtles almond turtles macadamia turtles and naturally pecan turtles
4754907 ill have people bring in live turtles wanting to know if i want to buy them
4754908 a lot of people who are down here on vacation will buy one to eat while theyre out walking
4754909 we never realized how popular turtles really are its just unbelievable its really become a challenge to keep filling the store with more and more turtles
4754910 our hypothesis was that if we could artificially induce conditions like those produced by the armstrong strain it would help the immune system clear an infection by clone 13
4754911 there needs to be zero tolerance for sexual abuse of children and were getting close in pennsylvania
4754912 we hold that the changes called creation and procreation are divine and that human sexuality is to humans the most available expression of that function of divinity sexual activity is the greatest act a human can do
4754913 its becoming increasingly important that we keep our professional and social lives separate and manage our online reputation as effectively as possible
4754914 there have been plenty of stories lately involving the type of behaviour that is completely inappropriate for a work environment people need to realise that even virtual actions can have very real consequences
4754915 these findings may suggest a new approach to treating serious strep infections by supporting our bodys natural defense system
4754916 adding an additional two three or five minutes or even 75 seconds does add some additional injury it could be 10 percent
4754917 councils would step in to deal with an under nourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different council equipment and infrastructure is having to be modified to deal with a population that is getting larger and larger if parents consistently place their children at risk through bad diet and lack of exercise is it right that a council should step in to keep the childs health under review
4754918 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences
4754919 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
4754920 every so often the rearrangements may be advantageous those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
4754921 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
4754922 its got three different cultural areas for food and its good but its the biggest amount of food ive ever seen in one place its kind of overwhelming
4754923 its really comfortable theyve got american chefs its more restaurant style and you can feel more at home
4754924 i am thrilled to be in a place ive never been that offers so much and on such a vast scale black lung disease being the exception
4754925 results from tests on genetic material from alleged remains of bigfoot made public at a news conference in palo alto one of the two samples of dna said to prove the existence of the bigfoot came from a human and the other was 96 percent from an opossum said curt nelson a scientist at the university of minnesota who performed the analysis

4754935 at first glance its hard to imagine two more biologically distinct groups of people burying their dead in the same place
4754936 the biggest mystery is how they seemed to have done this without disturbing a single grave
4754937 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4754938 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4754939 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4754940 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4754941 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4754942 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4754943 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4754944 who are open to doing something on the production side
4754945 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4754946 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4754947 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4754948 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4754949 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4754950 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4754951 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4754952 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4754953 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4754954 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4754955 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4754956 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4754957 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4754958 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4754959 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4754960 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4754961 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4754962 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4754963 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4754964 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4754965 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4754966 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4754967 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4754968 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4754969 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4754970 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4754971 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4754972 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4754973 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4754974 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4754975 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4754976 i had to go back and review some of the things from my background in the west coast system
4754977 but really not much other than again being excited about getting him here and just working through the language issues
4754978 theres no way playing in the nfl and getting to do the things ive been able to do that you can replace that
4754979 its impossible and so up to this point im willing to do whatever it takes to continue to do that its harder i felt 38 today im not going to lie to you
4754980 he goes im a little bit fatigued like we all are but i said yeah youre old you are youre old he laughs but hes doing good
4754981 i mean i didnt really see the barn doors being blown off yesterday with the fatigue comment
4754982 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4754983 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4754984 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4754985 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4754986 no matter who prepares the return the taxpayer is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of the return
4754987 doesnt make much sense from a tax complexity or economic necessity perspective
4754988 if congress truly cared about the impact of rising property taxes on elderly low income homeowners it would do something other than enact a provision that benefits a fairly small proportion of them it would examine the reasons for those property tax increases and if it did so properly it would discover that it yes the congress is responsible for a substantial portion of the increase
4754989 this nation has had an educational experience with refundable credits targeted toward low income taxpayers
4754990 a useless credit isnt much of an incentive whether or not one agrees with the incentive
4754991 a certified public accountant and tax attorney with over 25 years representing taxpayers before the internal revenue service united states tax court united states district court and bankruptcy court
4754992 received a notice from the irs about an amt discrepancy on your return dont assume the irs is right
4754993 the treasury inspector general for tax administration tigta has done a study and found the complexity of the amt causes errors in determining and computing the tax
4754994 the 73rd birthday of the social security system in the united states
4754995 we could buy one of those little window units but wed probably need three of them to make a difference
4754996 i think its cooling off quicker tonight than it did last night
4754997 do you think it might have something to do with the fact that were sitting in front of two fans on high eating ice cream
4754998 moreover even if victorious obama will inherit the calamitous conditions wrought by conservative failures a sinking economy unsustainable occupations in iraq and afghanistan accelerating climate change gilded age inequality a broken healthcare system and much more
4754999 obama will also be limited by the constricted consensus of an establishment not yet able to contemplate the changes needed to set this country right again
4755000 it was felt that his behavior on the medal podium and during the medal ceremony was not appropriate
4755001 his behavior was not in the olympic spirit of respect for his fellow athletes whatever grievances you may have this was not the way to go about it
4755002 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants
4755003 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play

4755008 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4755009 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4755010 a war is just if there is no alternative and the resort to arms is legitimate if they represent your last hope
4755011 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4755012 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4755013 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4755014 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4755015 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4755016 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4755017 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4755018 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4755019 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4755020 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4755021 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4755022 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4755023 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4755024 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4755025 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4755026 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4755027 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4755028 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4755029 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

4755087 but as for the foundation level of their relationship is concerned kareena is doubly ruled by jupiter number 3 21st september 1980 the planet of wealth and prosperity whereas saif on the other hand is under the influence of moon and neptune planets of peace creativity and spirituality
4755088 this indeed is not a good combination as most of kareenas decisions will be too materialistic in its approach while saif will always listen to his heart first and will be rather emotional while taking his decisions although he will be very firm about what he eventually does since their thinking patterns towards life are so different from each other they are most likely to have a lot of difference of opinion on almost everything at every step

4755090 like all cas certificate authorities globalsign vets a company within strict guidelines but we cannot form an opinion on the software they sign with the issued certificate while we cannot provide a guarantee around the quality of the software the certificate does provide proof of which company is responsible for the software and therefore provides traceability to any parties using that software this traceability allows us to perform an appropriate investigation
4755091 the concept of code signing certificates from any ca whoever they are is designed to provide assurances of origin of the software but cannot express that it is virus free bug free or malware free
4755092 globalsign was made aware of this alleged misuse of a code signing certificate on 15 august at approximately 14 00 the vetting archive was immediately checked to determine what was file for the company llc ajsbiri we were found to have the appropriate company documentation and incorporation documentation needed to vet the origin and existence of a company in line with the practice statement for vetting code signing certificate applicants
4755093 within an hour of the reported incident we had attempted to examine the executable however the site was no longer live after an unsuccessful attempt to contact the company by telephone we decided the best course of action in the short term would be to revoke the certificate the investigation will continue with the company in question to determine why they had potentially been in breach of the subscriber agreement for permitted use of the code signing certificate

4755113 an almost hysterical antagonism toward the gold standard is an issue that unites statists of all persuasions they seem to sense that gold and economic freedom are inseparable
4755114 under the gold standard a free banking system stands as the protector of an economys stability and balanced growth
4755115 the excess credit which the fed pumped into the economy spilled over into the stock market triggering a fantastic speculative boom
4755116 by 1929 the speculative imbalances had become overwhelming and unmanageable by the fed
4755117 in the absence of the gold standard there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation
4755118 a favorable moment to shut and bar the door against paper money
4755119 the necessary confidence between man and man on necessary confidence in public councils on the industry and morals of people and on the character of republican government
4755120 i have been quite surprised and i must say pleased by the fact that central banks have been able to effectively simulate many of the characteristics of the gold standard by constraining the degree of finance in a manner which effectively brought down the general price levels
4755121 the record of the past 20 years appears to underscore the observation that although pressures for excess issuance of fiat money are chronic a prudent monetary policy maintained over a protracted period of time can contain the forces of inflation

4755123 pulp magazine adventures rooted in the exotic and glamorous locations that the stories were set in seedy waterfront bars plush penthouses dripping with girls all the magic of a vanished age it struck me that it might be possible to get the same effect by placing the story in the near future as opposed to the near past if we handled it right we could create the same sense of mingled exoticism and familiarity

4755146 there is no need to exaggerate the part played in the creation of bolshevism and in the actual bringing about of the russian revolution by these international and for the most part atheistical jews it is certainly a very great one it probably outweighs all others with the notable exception of lenin the majority of the leading figures are jews moreover the principal inspiration and driving power comes from the jewish leaders thus tchitcherin a pure russian is eclipsed by his nominal subordinate litvinoff and the influence of russians like bukharin or lunacharski cannot be compared with the power of trotsky or of zinovieff or of krassin or radek all jews in the soviet institutions the predominance of jews is even more astonishing and the prominent if not indeed the principal part in the system of terrorism applied by the extraordinary commission for combating counter revolution the cheka has been taken by jews and in some notable cases by jewesses the same evil prominence was obtained by jews in the brief period of terror during which bela kun ruled in hungary the same phenomenon has been presented in germany especially in bavaria so far as this madness has been allowed to prey upon the temporary prostration of the german people although in all these countries there are many non jews every whit as bad as the worst of the jewish revolutionaries the part played by the latter in proportion to their numbers in the population is astonishing
4755147 how can i get elected what must i promise the people in order to get their votes what policy will make me popular

4755216 he used to teas her due to you only juvaj lost subject juvaj is good person so xxxxx named her 420 etc

4755218 juvaj once you asked her for a movie and she laughed and left away right

4755223 you can become bad for things you want thats not good
4755224 we thought we had a chance and we put our heads down
4755225 it was probably ugly at that stage very ugly just digging deep it was beyond skills almost it was so primeval
4755226 it was just auto pilot we were flying blind rowing blind we rowed from the heart
4755227 maybe we let them get out more than was comfortable for us
4755228 this expansion reinforces colorados standing as a national and international leader in clean modern energy for the future
4755229 feats of prowess and agility were meant to please zeus who picked the most worthy athlete to be the victor
4755230 conspicuous and popular aspect at pagan festivals attracting tens of thousands of people
4755231 stop stealing our money by charging exorbitant prices and taking obscene profits
4755232 maybe five minutes before i tried to stand up and fell over again yeah i wanted to be part of that experience the other guys raced fantastically today and i dont think its fair on them not to be there
4755233 obviously because of his illness hes had this week he probably had less reserves in his tank than he would normally
4755234 he obviously raced with what he had which was a gutsy effort
4755235 thats whats great about this regatta nobody expects us to win a medal but were not here as tourists
4755236 it feels great im probably in the best sailing shape ive been in for 30 years
4755237 it was the thrill of a lifetime i mean standing there in a tunnel people chanting usa the adrenalin pumping it was just a moment to remember my whole life
4755238 theyre all super sailors at least 12 of them could win the gold medal i mean they are that tough
4755239 1000 is one of the numbers in a predefined list of possible browser widths

4755241 we can talk on the phone as we eat fast food while using the atm not only are we better at multitasking and becoming more productive and efficient along with the increased pace more is required of us and so we hurtle through life faster and faster becoming busier and busier the result is that in our busyness we are becoming increasingly efficient at leading meaningless lives
4755242 i think that he can be called michael the best olympian of all time more so not because he has more gold medals than anybody but in the way hes handled himself and in the way hes actually won under a tremendous amount of pressure
4755243 as soon as i took the last half stroke to be honest i thought i had lost the race
4755244 and that was the difference cause if i would have glided then i would have come up short ive been lucky enough over the last four years to have two pretty good finishes in olympic finals i guess im blessed
4755245 its always been a goal of mine i never really expected i could do it at this moment
4755246 its just such a dream i heard she is here and it would be really nice to meet her
4755247 if the queen is watching this girl should be made a dame dame rebecca adlington shes my best mate so im allowed to say that
4755248 when i realized i was on my own i just went for it i couldnt have done it without my mum and dad it was fantastic that they were finally here
4755249 i had hoped that hoff would use the 800 to take revenge on adlington she was the swimmer who edged out hoff for gold in the 400 free a few days ago
4755250 you have to push yourself push your body every single session
4755251 theres times you dont want to drive home you want to sit on the pool deck and want superpowers to get you home in bed im glad the hard work paid off
4755252 he just built me up and to be honest i couldnt have done it without him
4755253 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4755254 there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4755255 its almost too close to see one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4755256 you dont want to go out there and take it for granted then youre going to mess up
4755257 i will continue to struggle and work hard hopefully this is the start of many good things to come
4755258 im definitely pleased that if i couldnt do it she was the one
4755259 and im old enough to be able to handle it
4755260 i wouldnt have come back if i wasnt ready to come back
4755261 its what i do get out on the sidelines and get the boys fired up
4755262 weve got to come out from the beginning we cant come out dead again that cant happen
4755263 i could feel the nervousness building up inside me so i wasnt hoping for it to last much longer
4755264 you get a little bit stronger sometimes with the adrenaline rush and so you come up a lot quicker and you overshoot your target a little bit
4755265 im still happy im a mexican american representing his country at the heaviest weight weve ever done it
4755266 i still cant believe that we came back and won that match
4755267 theres going to be a lot more olympics in my future
4755268 i was pretty calm until i got on the trampoline
4755269 theyve got to know now that if they play like that they can win this thing
4755270 they honestly can win this thing its a huge boost but it doesnt mean anything unless we win monday
4755271 i wasnt even sure i would take part in this olympics
4755272 but because it was in beijing i wanted to be here
4755273 we stayed in the game but were still not as good as them
4755274 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
4755275 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
4755276 i just want to enjoy this moment because its a huge moment in my career
4755277 why arent you putting my drawings on your internet daddy
4755278 you write on a topic of great interest to me if you can interest that traffic i will appreciate it
4755279 why arent you putting my drawings on your internet daddy
4755280 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4755281 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4755282 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4755283 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4755284 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4755285 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4755286 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4755287 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4755288 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4755289 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4755290 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4755291 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4755292 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4755293 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4755294 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4755295 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4755296 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4755297 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4755298 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4755299 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4755300 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4755301 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4755302 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4755303 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4755304 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

4755307 since i talked with manager martin oneill in april i didnt talk with anyone else at aston villa all the talks have been between rick parry and the owner and chief executive of aston villa and they have been pretty good
4755308 if someone wants to talk about barry in the future they will have to talk to the owner or chief executive of aston villa or rick parry
4755309 i was not doing the talks about barry i was not doing the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal
4755310 if you want to talk about players you have to talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football talk to me
4755311 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
4755312 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
4755313 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion liverpool thinks the price quoted is too high

4755321 go for it do it make it happen lets help some people
4755322 it is so hard when people are in such pain and theyre in such need to send them away
4755323 the people we serve some of them come from years and years of homelessness and drug use
4755324 its always too wet too cold too dry too hot
4755325 we always make sure theres plenty of liquids on the job site and were very conscious about each other we keep an eye on each other to make sure were sweating properly and staying hydrated
4755326 its really about doing something to lower the overall impact from the beginning of development through construction and then after the building is developed

4755357 additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4755358 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4755359 enabling us to train our army and giving us the possibility to withstand the russians
4755360 israel is betraying us along with the european countries and the united states
4755361 today there was a cossack pogrom against the local population as a jew that gives me a different feeling
4755362 israel did it at the russians behest it aided the terrorists the russians its a disgrace i dont know what it received in return i only see that hezbollah continues to get russian arms and plenty of it
4755363 there are many israeli businesspeople who invested money and a country should protect its citizens investments
4755364 they never believed georgia has such an army and that they would encounter such resistance
4755365 russia deployed 30 000 soldiers and a thousand tanks our people are not suicidal we dont want our soldiers to remain in the field and be killed by russian planes
4755366 the separatists fired at georgian villages we returned fire and asked the russians to order the ossetians to stop the russian representative told me we have to agree to a total cease fire and that president saakashvili had issued such an order to our army and we did not return fire even when they bombarded two of our villages i told the president we should pay the price just let there be peace but when we found out that they were continuing to transfer more weapons through the roki tunnel between russia and ossetia we had to attack it was a matter of screwing or being screwed

4755371 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4755372 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4755373 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4755374 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4755398 in terms of car set up we need to remember that like monaco the track will be both green and dusty on the opening day of practice that sometimes tempts you into playing with set up more than you would like so you need to resist that temptation and let the track come to the car our simulations suggest well employ a downforce level similar to that of hockenheim but the individual demands of the track may push that window up or down finally anybody whos studied any onboard footage of the circuit will be mindful of the proximity of the concrete barriers in certain areas clearly well be packing plenty of spares but hoping we wont need to use them
4755399 the most important thing is to be thorough methodical and iterative although we arrive at a new racetrack having undertaken a huge amount of research and armed with an enormous amount of data the reality is that its really only the starting point for our engineering team we begin friday practice the way we would at any other circuit but in this instance we need to pay particular attention both to driver feedback and the data generated from the car the important thing is not to react too hastily its vital that you dont end up going down the wrong path because you only have a limited amount of time to tune the set up before qualifying

4755404 we were together 24 hours a day never leaving each others side
4755405 we depended upon the blessing of the lord and the goodwill and kindness of the people we met
4755406 i trusted that was where the lord wanted me and that i was doing his work

4755424 if every country were to do this it would put a stop to these illegal activities i hope this model will be followed by other european countries

4755442 im certain that the millions of zimbabweans both inside and outside zimbabwe await with great expectations and high hopes a positive outcome from our deliberations

4755447 we know this is a war between the west and russia
4755448 it is unlikely that ossetians and abkhazians will be able to live with georgians in one state

4755476 youve probably heard how expensive those new lzr costumes are about 200 a go
4755477 coming into this meet nobody wanted to speak to me i was miss nobody
4755478 its going to be a steep learning curve for her getting used to this attention but i think the penny dropped when we came out to that crush
4755479 but she will handle it shes a mansfield girl and a pretty amazing one too shell keep her feet on the ground
4755480 i could just hear them all shouting i could hear simon burnett yell i want your babies which i am sure his girlfriend would have something to say about as well as my boyfriend
4755481 it is just so inspiring going to london in four years time it is a long way away off and will mean a lot of hard work but it gives you the inspiration to do it when becky can just go out there and smash the world record to win her second gold
4755482 i have had the privilege of seeing her train every day and i know what she puts herself through and how tough she is
4755483 i saw how upset she was after last years world championships but to be honest i believe if she had not had that disappointment she might not have done this now because it made her a stronger person
4755484 she was bawling her eyes out she was so upset
4755485 so that was the only question mark over becky there was no doubting her talent or her hard work but could she do it at a major championship
4755486 i learnt a lot about myself that day i had trained so hard no less hard than i have been this year but it was my first major meet and i was a bit out of my depth to be honest
4755487 i got out of the pool after failing to make the final and i was distraught i was in tears i have never been so upset i swore then that i was never going to let that happen again that i was not going to be getting out of the olympic pool crying my eyes out
4755488 it was a really testing time for the family and to be honest a lot of people were questioning whether she could come back from that
4755489 mum has given so much for me she is the one who is always there to ferry me around to make sure things are right my dad helps me financially but my mum is basically my manager
4755490 i thought oh no maybe theyve have missed my gold so in the 800m i just wanted so much to do it for them
4755491 at about 500m i breathed and happened to look up and i saw my mum in the crowd with the union jack i wasnt looking for them it was just luck and i thought ive got to do it for them
4755492 the prospect of another four years of such hard work feels a bit daunting right now but i am going to have a good few months off which will help but my body is developing i am more muscley than i was last year so i am getting stronger it is early days now but i may focus more on the 200m and the 400m as the training for the 800m is such hard work

4755502 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte

4755506 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4755511 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile

4755516 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4755517 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4755518 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4755519 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4755520 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4755521 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4755522 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4755523 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4755524 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4755525 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4755526 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4755527 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4755528 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4755529 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4755530 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4755531 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4755532 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4755533 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4755538 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4755539 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4755540 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4755541 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4755542 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4755548 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche

4755555 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales

4755606 there are also no indications that the white house will turn this into a nuclear confrontation with russia despite a remark by vice president cheney that the russian aggression will not stand and must not go unanswered cheney gave no further indication of what the us might or might not do in the current crisis

4755703 not giving official guidance to the public yet about the next version of windows other than that were working on it when we are ready we will provide updates
4755704 starting on august 14 2008 steven sinofsky leading the windows group jon devaan leading windows engineering and the windows engineers are co authors of a new blog that is specifically focusing on the coming wave of client technology in windows 7 it is a treasure to get direct from the horses mouth information about what is reality and what is vapor when discussing windows 7
4755705 microsoft might be trying to accomplish by maintaining a little bit more control over the communication around windows 7 some might say that this is a significant understatement we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk again top of mind for us is the responsibility we feel to make sure we are not stressing priorities churning resource allocations or causing strategic confusion among the tens of thousands of partners and customers who care deeply and have much invested in the evolution of windows
4755706 windows has all the challenges of every large scale software project picking features designing them developing them and delivering them with high quality windows has an added challenge of doing so for an extraordinarily diverse set of customers as a team and as individuals on the team we continue to be humbled by this responsibility we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open and honest and two way discussion about how we balance all of these interests and deliver software on the scale of windows
4755707 related to disclosure is the idea of how we make sure not to set expectations around the release that end up disappointing you features that dont make it claims that dont stick or support we dont provide starting from the first days of developing windows 7 we have committed as a team to promise and deliver thats our goal share with you what were going to get done why were doing it and deliver it with high quality and on time
4755708 it is quite understandable that media analysts developers it pros general public and microsoft employees not in the engineering team are genuinely curious and interested to learn whats coming in the upcoming next version of windows
4755709 if you ask me i would not expect e7 to be the place where announcements about new features and release schedule are made what i believe this is going to be is a sharing opportunity to discuss the complexity and challenges behind a large and complex project like the creation of the next version of windows is

4755731 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4755732 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4755733 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4755734 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4755735 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4755736 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4755737 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4755738 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4755739 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4755740 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4755741 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4755742 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4755743 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4755744 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4755745 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4755746 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4755747 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4755748 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4755749 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4755750 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4755751 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4755752 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4755753 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4755754 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4755755 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4755756 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4755757 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4755758 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4755759 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4755760 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4755761 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4755762 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4755763 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4755764 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4755765 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4755766 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4755767 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

4755769 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4755770 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4755771 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4755772 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4755773 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4755774 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4755775 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4755776 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4755777 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4755778 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4755779 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4755780 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4755781 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4755782 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4755783 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4755784 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4755785 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4755786 i have been wracking my brain i cant think of an instance in a political campaign that the democratic and republican nominees appear side by side in a church
4755787 this is unique in a couple of respects they are in a church hosted by a pastor and both are there
4755788 hurricane katrina was in fact the judgment of god against the city of new orleans
4755789 both see an opportunity in mccains case to show up and strengthen support among evangelicals and with obama to try to make inroads with evangelical voters
4755790 represent the antithesis of not to mention supreme american values
4755791 he is the poster child of the new generation of evangelical leadership that has a broader political agenda than gay marriage and other social
4755792 the lines separating the parties and particularly as it relates to these two candidates are shifting and this voting bloc that had been extremely solidly republican is more and more up for grabs
4755793 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4755794 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4755795 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4755796 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4755797 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4755798 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4755799 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4755800 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

4755817 el vestuario tiene ganas de revancha fuimos a por el partido de ida pero no tuvimos suerte el equipo est vivo y s lo pensamos en vencer y superar la eliminatoria
4755818 creo que s lo nos falt el gol en la segunda parte fuimos a por el encuentro y tuvimos tres o cuatro ocasiones las mismas que ellos
4755819 creo que con su ayuda y el apoyo del p blico no tendremos problemas para superar la eliminatoria
4755820 no debemos volvernos locos en ataque ya que el equipo tiene una enorme calidad en esa posici n adem s tendremos que evitar cualquier gol del equipo alem n
4755821 mi verdadero puesto es el de central el lateral no es una posici n que me guste mucho pero creo que tendr que acostumbrarme a esa posici n ya que mis compa eros en el centro de la defensa lo est n haciendo muy bien

4755827 it is apparent that judge deweese has both expanded the current display beyond the ten commandments alone and offered his views of the competing philosophies represented in the display
4755828 as explained above the court finds that the expansion of the display when combined with the editorial comments significantly changed the new display from the 2002 display

4755833 for any citizen with time to spare and a alan au is 57
4755834 were at the table with a lot of recruits because of the publicity ive received because of my family
4755835 this kind of publicity allows me to call aau coaches and even if they dont know me they will at least listen and get to know me and right now id say 70 percent of the guys were in with wouldnt be interested in us if they didnt know me because of my family
4755836 its getting me in the door and then its the same thing ive said about barack and michelle that if you get to know them youre going to vote for them and thats what i hope people say about me if they get to know me i think theyll at least let me in on their kid and i have always felt that i can be as good as anybody if i can just get in the living room
4755837 we were sixth last season and the goal is to be better this time
4755838 we were close to liverpool for a lot of time last season and now we have a stronger squad
4755839 there is no reason to believe that we cant reach the top four
4755840 it is my belief and i hope that everyone else believes it as well we have a chance to do it
4755841 this is a challenge for me and i do like a challenge there is a great environment at the club and i like the way that we all pull together
4755842 we are one unit and that is very important for me there is a great group of players here it is an ambitious young squad that can only get better and better
4755843 chelsea have been very helpful and i would like to thank them

4755845 if your dear heart is wounded my wild heart bleeds with yours
4755846 theyve been a premier league side and all but one game of their run without a league win was at that level and thats a very difficult place to get a result
4755847 as soon as paul jewell can get a league result that will help him and im sure more will come but its going to be hard and we wont make it easy for them t some stage a club like derby county will turn it around theyre wounded animals and we have to be aware of that we have to make sure its not this weekend where they begin their turnaround
4755848 i was on the bench but i tried the warm up and i could feel it it was getting worse so i had to pull out and give one of the young lads a chance but i was gutted
4755849 the amount of money being talked about is unthinkable but that is how the football transfer market is if that is what a club pays for a player that is because that is what he is worth
4755850 i only know him from watching him on television where he appears to be a great player if he had come and added something to madrid then he would have been welcome
4755851 it is clear that the president has wanted to sign him but if the player was unable to do that then there is little that he could do
4755852 but we know that when the season finishes there is always a two or three week period when the papers are filled with all kinds of stories
4755853 in the summer they have to fill their pages with things like this
4755854 after six year without winning the champions league everyone wants to conquer europe again but we must stop and remember that we have won two league titles in a row after four years without any trophies
4755855 we all want to win more but we have to go little by little if this season we have a chance to win the copa del rey then we should go for that too
4755856 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
4755857 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
4755858 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
4755859 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
4755860 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
4755861 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
4755862 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
4755863 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
4755864 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4755865 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
4755866 its very good that were getting it because up until now if we had a family where somebody was in a wheelchair we had to carry them in
4755867 we had that happen like three weeks ago with a woman who couldnt get up the stairs so this will be something very good for everyone
4755868 coming to the center it can be traumatic anyway but when your mommy cant come in with you its even worse
4755869 we dont set them once a month once every six months once a year if theres a need and we can get out the people to do it we do it
4755870 when something like this comes up its a no brainer
4755871 any other projects we may do are based off the needs in our communities so each one has a certain area like oak grove or purvis
4755872 but these abuse prevention centers those are the focus for all exchange clubs
4755873 the favre foundation paid a lot of money to help get this house
4755874 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
4755875 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
4755876 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4755877 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
4755878 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
4755879 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
4755880 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
4755881 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
4755882 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
4755883 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
4755884 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
4755885 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
4755886 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
4755887 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
4755888 nous avons t enchant s par les succ s de l v nement 2006
4755889 many of us would rather watch a noisy demonstration of miracles signs and wonders than have a quiet bible study yet we are faced today with the sad reality that our untempered zeal is a sign of immaturity our adolescent craving for the wild and crazy makes us do stupid things its way past time for us to grow up
4755890 true revival will be accompanied by brokenness humility reverence and repentance not the arrogance showmanship and empty hype that often was on display in lakeland
4755891 a prominent pentecostal evangelist called me this week after bentleys news hit the fan
4755892 im now convinced that a large segment of the charismatic church will follow the anti christ when he shows up because they have no discernment
4755893 the coming of the lawless one is by the activity of satan with all power and false signs and wonders and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing because they refused to love the truth and so be saved therefore god sends them a strong delusion so that they may believe what is false in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness
4755894 but because of his great love for us god who is rich in mercy made us alive with christ even when we were dead in transgressions it is by grace you have been saved and god raised us up with christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in christ jesus in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace expressed in his kindness to us in christ jesus
4755895 again if the trumpet does not sound a clear call who will get ready for battle
4755896 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
4755897 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
4755898 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
4755899 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
4755900 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
4755901 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
4755902 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
4755903 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
4755904 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
4755905 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca

4755909 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4755910 i was in high school when she hit it big
4755911 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4755912 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4755913 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4755914 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4755915 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4755916 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4755917 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4755918 film which appealed to older women because of its portrayal of the late 40s and 50s as a still sexy time of life
4755919 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4755920 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4755921 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4755922 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself

4755953 anne houser was a wild child going to catlin gabel
4755954 it wasnt working out she was a spoiled kid and they sent her to dry out with the country cousins
4755955 we had given anne the choice of either going to a prep boarding school in the east or rod and lois volunteered to treat her as their daughter and let her come over and live with them and go to redmond high school
4755956 the wildest family in terms of the multitude of crimes that i have ever come across when you read the oregon criminal code especially with randy and his father there arent many crimes they havent committed
4755957 once was at disneyland where they dont sell alcoholic beverages and one was kings canyon where again they dont sell alcoholic beverages
4755958 in a small town you know all the bad guys and they know you
4755959 they just loaded it into the basket and walked out
4755960 fact is we couldnt cross my dad without him hurting us some way
4755961 sexually perverse toward virtually every female who came into the household
4755962 i wasnt happy with them and they werent happy with me and my parents gave me to joel and kathleen
4755963 it was a really different family just because of the fact that their father basically had two wives
4755964 i dont think i could have counted all of them
4755965 her boys seemed to be a lot more important to her than her daughter
4755966 i dont think in all this time i ever had her ask me how tammy was
4755967 ann landers once said you have to ask yourself a question are you better off with him or without him i asked the question for my kids they were still gaining something from their father joel taught randy how to weld
4755968 i always had to wait in the car and i thought that was really strange and anytime i asked him about his family life or anything he got very defensive and said nothing
4755969 that i needed to concentrate on my studies and that he thought that randy was a snake and that he didnt want him around or near me anymore and if he ever came on the property again that he was going to shoot him

4755981 i have very high expectations for this group it should be the anchor of our defense those guys are tested theyre quality players whove been in the program a long time they have a lot of games under their belt
4755982 we had a great group of linebackers before us with nick reid and kevin kane and banks floodman so our first year out there was a little rough getting that playing experience but along with playing came a lot of confidence

4756450 dara torres is doubling up her duties in her run at history on sunday
4756451 my motivation stems from the fact that i love this game and i never stopped playing it whether its a pickup game with deion sanders
4756452 it was felt that his behavior on the medal podium and during the medal ceremony was not appropriate
4756453 his behavior was not in the olympic spirit of respect for his fellow athletes whatever grievances you may have this was not the way to go about it
4756454 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants
4756455 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play
4756456 i am sure every historian archeologist and storyteller is as excited about this as i am
4756457 this announcement and the search for these two vessels has the allure of an indiana jones mystery

4756472 i said i was going to kiss the medal if i got that gold everyone bites it
4756473 i was going to make out with mine i guess ill have to wait another four years to do that
4756474 i feel i could have done more that i didnt lay it all out there
4756475 im very upset i didnt attack more i shouldve fought harder
4756476 its the olympic games were not coming in here and expecting a medal to land in our lap
4756477 on one hand its a pity no gold on the other hand thank god i got the bronze i appreciate this medal
4756478 she was quite strong so i should accept the result

4756500 is there more to our universe than what i can perceive through my senses
4756501 god has chosen things which are not the invisible to bring to nought things which are the visible
4756502 that would imply that the velocity of light was more than ten million times faster prior to 3 000 b c this possibility would also alter our concepts of time and the age of the universe the universe might actually be less than 10 000 years old

4756551 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
4756552 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
4756553 they put the protection of the killers above the attainment of justice
4756554 the very serious concerns about how the police handled this investigation from beginning to end
4756555 that is why my position is to support the calls that are made by families here for the establishment of an independent tribunal
4756556 they obviously have lost all faith and we have seen debacle after debacle in terms of the investigation of this terrible atrocity what we need to do is support the families in the demands they now make
4756557 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
4756558 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me
4756559 ryanair planned to clamp down on screenscraping websites that he says are ripping customers off by adding
4756560 the battle against prince nuada which is to lead to co antrim in northern ireland
4756561 it appears to be more difficult for a north of irelander to allow an honest difference of opinion in an opponent so that he is apt to regard the terms opponent and enemy as synonymous
4756562 the short answer is his people are indeed from ulster from county antrim ireland they left from coleraine town circa 1719 and appear on the border of the pennsylvania and maryland colony in the early 1720s his immigrant ancestor was named alexander mckean and yes the two lads who run the ulster heritage dna project are from the same mccain family
4756563 the conservative party has no issue with the orange order it is a perfectly legal organisation and many of its members are engaged in charity and church work
4756564 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
4756565 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
4756566 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
4756567 international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
4756568 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away
4756569 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
4756570 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
4756571 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
4756572 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
4756573 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
4756574 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to

4756580 hay comunidades que debemos tener un plus que ahora mismo no se reconoce derivado del fen meno de la inmigraci n
4756581 es verdad que el inmigrante paga aqu sus impuestos pero tambi n es verdad que la mayor parte se los lleva el estado y nos lo ha de retornar
4756582 me parece muy bien que a castilla la mancha castilla le n o extremadura haya que compensarles la dispersi n por los traslados costosos pero la inmigraci n es un factor no reconocido y pedimos que se haga
4756583 de hecho dijo el a o con mayor crisis econ mica que es este han llegado m s alumnos inmigrantes en la comunitat lo que significa que hay un efecto de atractivo porque todo el mundo nos conoce como una comunidad activa
4756584 viene la gente pero no recibimos ayuda del gobierno socialista

4756589 cuando todos los ciudadanos no tienen los mismos derechos en todos los territorios ya no hablamos de derechos sino de privilegios
4756590 el problema no es que zapatero tome medidas m s o menos acertadas o que sean ocurrencias

4756641 wir hatten im landkreis im vergangenen jahr mehr als 5500 eins tze dabei r ckten wir 200 mal wegen blinden alarms aus 450 mal wegen fehlalarms durch brandmeldeanlagen
4756642 derartige f lle kommen sehr selten vor zumal wir dank der technik nachvollziehen k nnen woher der anruf stammt
4756643 oft sind die brandmelder vor ort defekt oder sie wurden bei bauarbeiten nicht abgeschaltet stauben voll und klingeln alarm

4756645 oft l uft die suche nach solchen alarmierern ins leere dann muss die kommune die kosten tragen
4756646 wir hatten 2407 fehlalarme das sind fast so viele wie die 2506 tats chlichen br nde
4756647 allerdings kommen da noch 9133 f lle hinzu in der die feuerwehr hilfe geleistet hat die fehlalarme lagen also bei etwa 17 prozent
4756648 es sind die automatischen brandmelder in hotels oder altenheimen die eine hohe fehlerquote haben
4756649 zu mehr als der h lfte sind die alarme st rungen 24 mal war es grober unfug und in jedem dritten fall war es fahrl ssigkeit da hatte zum beispiel jemand unter dem ding geraucht
4756650 sie sind ja schon besser geworden und mit sicherheit helfen sie br nde fr her zu entdecken
4756651 aber lieber fahren wir neunmal umsonst als einmal zu sp t
4756652 bei uns sind es um die 600 euro aber nur bei fahrl ssigkeit oder grobem unfug
4756653 vor kurzem gab es holzarbeiten in einem hotel und der staub l ste den alarm aus weil wir umsonst raus mussten muss der betreiber die konsequenzen tragen schlie lich h tte er den alarm einfach deaktivieren k nnen
4756654 aber im jahr davor waren es noch gut 100 f lle mehr seit wir die fehlalarme berechnen sind die betreiber sensibler geworden und achten mehr auf die automaten

4756693 amnesty is not against the games but we want people to know what else is happening in china including the silencing of critics and peaceful protesters and to join our campaign for urgent human rights reform
4756694 people who speak out about human rights in china are being persecuted and locked up ahead of the olympics torture is commonplace right now were demanding the release of ye guozhu who was arrested and tortured just for protesting when his home was bulldozed to make way for olympics venues the chinese authorities promised when bidding for the olympics that hosting the games would improve human rights rather than honour these promises the government has cracked down on dissent more rigorously than before
4756695 with animation you can create a lot of emotion the characters in the amnesty china campaign are quite innocent and cuddly when something horrific happens the impact is greater because you have built up a bond with them

4756733 although stevens knowingly carried debt on a 31 000 interest free loan from his personal friend for more than 10 months during 2001 stevens did not list such a liability on his 2001 disclosure form
4756734 that was at the very start of the housing boom and the florida condominium market was really driven by speculative flippers who were placing preconstruction deposits and looking to flip these units for quick profits in many cases even before the buildings were complete
4756735 there were a lot of people who got rich doing this
4756736 electricians and taxi cab drivers and schoolteachers were making fortunes in some cases becoming millionaires but it was really a speculative market

4756762 we have no leadership right now with our older players
4756763 they do not understand the tempo we have to set
4756764 at inside linebacker the important thing is to see the brown thing that kid can go find the brown thing and thats the football and hes a willing hitter thats what we are looking for a willing physical football player who will find the ball and make people say ouch
4756765 the other day tyler wilson had a very good scrimmage
4756766 he was impressive on how he distributed the ball and his accuracy
4756767 they know your classes and what youre supposed to do and where youre supposed to be
4756768 ever ybody thats on the field is i guess a fivestar recruit where theyre from
4756769 that was one of the reasons i came here for early playing time
4756770 ive been working hard since i got here and its really paying off
4756771 it will be a little nervewracking since this is our first college game and were young freshmen getting the chance to play
4756772 at first it will be nervewracking but after the game well get used to it
4756773 ni le premier ministre ehoud olmert ni aucun autre responsable isra lien ne nous ont jamais propos doffre globale et d taill e
4756774 la zone de latrun et le grand j rusalem ne sont pas inclus dans les blocs de colonies soumis annexion
4756775 de plus isra l veut garder sous son contr le la vall e du jourdain et les rivages de la mer morte a terme isra l restera en possession de 30 40 des territoires de la cisjordanie olmert joue avec les chiffres pour tromper la communaut internationale et reporter sur le camp palestinien la responsabilit de l chec du processus de paix
4756776 cette offre na rien de neuf explique menahem klein professeur de sciences politiques et ancien conseiller dehoud barak le premier ministre isra lien cette poque dun point de vue territorial cest grosso modo ce que nous avons propos taba cette formule tait alors inacceptable pour les palestiniens et elle lest toujours aujourdhui dautant que la situation de mahmoud abbas est beaucoup plus inconfortable que celle de yasser arafat l poque gaza est une grande prison et la cisjordanie un protectorat isra lien o abbas ne peut pas bouger un policier sans en r f rer olmert
4756777 olmert sait quil approche de la fin il ne veut pas ajouter son bilan d j piteux le d sastre du processus de paix il se pr pare accuser les palestiniens alors m me quil sait pertinemment quun accord sans j rusalem est inacceptable pour eux
4756778 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4756779 moving around to weaken the civilian administration and perhaps create the conditions for political upheaval down the line
4756780 there can be no negotiated capitulations and negotiated dismemberment of smaller countries by bigger ones
4756781 the entire responsibility for the conflict for the cruel actions committed rests upon the shoulders of the georgian leadership
4756782 we would like to know whether it is humanitarian or military
4756783 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4756784 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4756785 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4756786 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4756787 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4756788 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4756789 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4756790 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4756791 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4756792 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4756793 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4756794 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4756795 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4756796 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4756797 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4756798 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4756799 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4756800 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4756801 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4756802 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4756803 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4756804 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4756805 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4756806 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4756807 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4756808 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4756809 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4756810 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4756811 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4756812 dont just say chicken wings they wont understand how awesome they were
4756813 hello hello hello my friend my friend hello hello hello
4756814 i pray and hope that hes all right because as a team weve already been banged up a bit
4756815 were a little sore weve got to push through it as a unit on the dline things like that happen robinsons injury does not appear to be as bad as it looked originally but hell certainly miss todays 9 a m scrimmage and will need time to recover
4756816 obviously you miss having an older guy forte out here with us
4756817 but we understand and middle linebacker jerry franklin understands and our older d linemen understand that we have to go get ready to play the show doesnt stop not so subtle signals are coming down from the coaches they are looking for tough guys who play through pain
4756818 its been a physical twoa days and were out there banging
4756819 the good thing is the games going to be easy compared to these two adays were putting in 16 hour days here harris has been helping ford get up to speed at free safety where the two are splitting reps
4756820 hes a physical specimen you can look at him and he looks like a small hercules out there
4756821 we need depth and with ford getting reps at ones and stuff hes building confidence its just competition
4756822 i thought wilson was real instinctive and did a lot of nice things in the last scrimmage work
4756823 he was impressive on how he distributed the ball and his accuracy hes still behind on his understanding of the offense
4756824 nathan knows the offense better but he has not thrown the ball as accurate as he did all spring
4756825 he had a big move in one of our tackling drills one day with his aggressiveness and he was cutting in line cheating because he couldnt get enough reps in there running full speed and hitting
4756826 hes got tremendous instincts so hes impressed me a lot
4756827 the hardest thing is standing there watching my teammates get tired making up for my reps
4756828 it was tough to stay positive but thats what ive tried to do
4756829 im back out there now and trying to get better every day coach bobby petrino said its a plus to have bequette back on the field
4756830 we have no leadership right now with our older players
4756831 they do not understand the tempo we have to set
4756832 i am disappointed with that as is our head coach theyve got to grow up and do it our way or we are going to move on period robinson said too many players arent showing the necessary intensity and sense of urgency during practice
4756833 right now as coaches we go out there with more emotion than our players do
4756834 but we cant play anymore we have to generate that emotion to them
4756835 they are either going to sit down and go why is he picking on me or they are going to bristle up and get after it
4756836 thats the type of player we are looking for until we get that were not going to be able to go on any further robinson also said some players who are not practicing arent hurting any more than some who are still on the field
4756837 we have to have our players understand the difference between pain and injury thats how you build leadership and build toughness
4756838 a quality injury youve got to respect its a matter of time before you can come back
4756839 but our kids have to understand they have got to play with pain
4756840 point it right back on me because to be honest with you 1 my 9 2 shoe should be halfway up their track right now
4756841 leadership is voted on by your peers and stuff but what you do on the field thats really what leadership is about
4756842 so in regards to that the performance is still the no 1 thing
4756843 weve got to understand its not one day on one day off one practice on next practice off
4756844 right now everything is weak our minds are weak ok write it i want them to hear it robinson said some players are getting the message but not enough of them
4756845 youre not going to win games by having just one or two guys doing it and the other nine guys arent buying into it robinson has been pleased with freshman khiry battle who worked as a starter at weakside linebacker with forte and ryan powers hamstring sidelined
4756846 all of a sudden we move him inside where the important thing is to see the brown thing
4756847 that kid can go find the brown thing and thats the football
4756848 he does that awfully well and hes a willing hitter he will find the ball and make people say ouch he will bring that right now
4756849 does he understand xs and os no but you can live with that ill keep it simple for him arkansas defensive players will get a chance to impress robinson today when the razorbacks hold their third major preseason scrimmage
4756850 a lot less long runs a lot less long passes
4756851 we thought we had an ok shot but they said no so weve got to follow the rules
4756852 im sure casey and everybody else would say the same thing
4756853 but it gave nathan and alex some more reps and thats good for them because they are going to get to play this year and i am not
4756854 and getting bigger faster and stronger its redshirting going to be a great thing for me
4756855 the agreement also includes a primetime game and doubleheader opportunities in addition cbs sports continues its coverage of sec regular season basketball
4756856 this landmark deal allows the sec on cbs to continue to be a cornerstone of our fall programming for many years to come
4756857 the agreement provides cbs sports with the opportunity to showcase the excitement pageantry and rich traditions of the sec across all cbs platforms
4756858 the southeastern conference is proud to continue its association with cbs sports
4756859 this national network agreement provides a unique platform to share both the athletic and academic achievements of the 12 member institutions
4756860 the sec is the gold standard in college athletics and we are proud to be associated with this great conference and its outstanding administrators coaches and studentathletes
4756861 the length of this deal is a testament to the great brand that the sec on cbs has become
4756862 the southeastern conference is extremely pleased to extend its long standing relationship with cbs sports
4756863 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4756864 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4756865 this is a planning took where all things are going
4756866 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4756867 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4756868 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4756869 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4756870 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4756871 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4756872 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4756873 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4756874 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4756875 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4756876 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4756877 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4756878 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4756879 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4756880 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4756881 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4756882 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4756883 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4756884 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4756885 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4756886 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4756887 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4756888 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4756889 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4756890 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4756891 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4756892 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds

4756905 pirmosios dienos rezultatais esame labai patenkinti o ir automobilis nerodo joki kapriz
4756906 im charon and im in charge of this barge that takes those who died down the river styx here youre near the gates of the underworld
4756907 yep the underworld you know where hades hangs his hat if he wore a hat
4756908 okay im still asleep and dreaming did i watch some episode of hercules last night to cause this dream
4756909 hades has been waiting a thousand years for you ever since old zeus zapped you out of his arms while you were both doing the wild thing thanks to your mother the head honcho of olympus sent you off into the future to be born in some mortal body
4756910 too bad its such a pitiful one from goddess to geek
4756911 oh hi boss sorry about the pitiful body part same about the geek thing but persephone sure isnt the same as she was before sure you still want her i mean aphrodite is interested in you and boy that goddess is well stacked
4756912 excuse me but what are you talking about i am not persephone im just plain old jenna krinard from nebraska can i wake up from this nightmare now
4756913 now tell me again that all this is a dream
4756914 write write write ive completed 4 tasks as of yesterday and achieved
4756915 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4756916 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4756917 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4756918 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4756919 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4756920 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4756921 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4756922 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4756923 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4756924 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4756925 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4756926 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4756927 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4756928 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4756929 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4756930 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4756931 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4756932 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4756933 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4756934 which do you think is farther away florida or the moon
4756935 i wish you guys would get your act together just yesterday you take away my license and then today you expect me to show it to you
4756936 so what were going to be the first on the sun
4756937 you cant land on the sun you idiot youll burn up
4756938 if you are in a vacuum and someone calls your name can you hear it
4756939 this was a stupid idea okay i dont even know this place
4756940 dad im just tired okay i dont want to talk about science at all
4756941 heres the deal we talk about science for this last round and ill let you use my colognes
4756942 tropic thunder was expected to close the summer blockbuster season and paramounts fraught ownership of dreamworks in spectacular fashion but the early numbers are well disappointing
4756943 it was felt that his behavior on the medal podium and during the medal ceremony was not appropriate
4756944 his behavior was not in the olympic spirit of respect for his fellow athletes whatever grievances you may have this was not the way to go about it
4756945 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants
4756946 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play
4756947 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4756948 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4756949 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4756950 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4756951 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4756952 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4756953 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4756954 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4756955 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4756956 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4756957 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4756958 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4756959 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4756960 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4756961 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

4756967 you have value on the ground more than you spent

4756983 when i did take that extra half stroke i thought that had lost the race
4756984 but i guess when i took that half stroke thats what i needed im really sort of at a loss for words im excited and just dont know what to say
4756985 the last 15 meters there was just no point to look over
4756986 i just kind of saw a shadow in the side of my goggles i knew he was coming and its kind of a good thing for myself because i like a chase and when someones chasing me i give a little extra
4756987 but especially the last eight meters i just put my head down i did not breathe the last eight meters
4756988 thats why they measure to one hundredths of a second to go that far and no further
4756989 i like to pee in the pool the pool the pool pee in the pool

4757035 we think basic ground rules are needed to ensure the kind of explosive innovation of the internet is able to continue

4757042 p2p applications are an emerging and important form of telecommunications in fact their efficiency and adaptability mean that they may become the dominant means of communication in the future
4757043 as a technology still in its relative infancy it is unclear what innovative and essential applications p2p protocols may eventually facilitate
4757044 should the commission countenance bells current approach to traffic shaping it will effectively place bell and other incumbent carriers in a position to decide which of the new and constantly emerging applications will receive widespread uptake
4757045 we have to lock our churches which is sort of sad
4757046 we all had powerpc code that got rewritten and its not that hard its just time consuming rogue amoeba has six people and we managed to port from one platform to another adobe has almost 6 000 people and they cant pull it off
4757047 developers of new software started after the intel announcement at wwdc 2005 already know the deal use xcode and don t make assumptions about the underlying processor architecture the way apple has set things up with xcode once you re compiling a universal binary it s not that much more work to keep producing universal binaries than it would be to produce binaries for a single architecture
4757048 if soundbooth is written entirely in standard c or c and they re using gcc no extra writing is necessary the same c code can be compiled for both architectures those are two big ifs though
4757049 designed from the ground up to deliver high quality sound to web and video workflows
4757050 by porting a previously pc only piece of software to the mactels is doing all mac users a favor because it strengthens apples media production options
4757051 i just dont think were in a position to know whether these were right policies or wrong policies yet
4757052 but if adobe after researching the matter carefully chooses to save itself an unspecified amount of time and expense by not porting a new version of an existing program to a platform that it was never designed for this is not betrayal arrogance or stupidity
4757053 for example none of the adobe statements seemed to me to be arrogant but you obviously feel differently
4757054 mac users should be happy because adobe brought this software to the mac platform and that alone was enough
4757055 and for that matter why cant a jet turbine be made as quickly and cheaply as a two stroke weed eater

4757071 palm sundays procession is about how to do the basic human thing to walk to take one step
4757072 the procession is a slow corporate event the pace is set by the weakest and slowest like growing a procession is something done for its own sake and in doing it we are becoming what we are not going by a way we do not understand for a purpose that is gods not ours in ways that are too simple for our sight

4757142 the church windows were opened to let the modern breeze flow through
4757143 subject concepts are to be evaluated not so much by how they cohere into a system as in terms of their capacity to articulate and undergird the ways that specific person in specific times and places struggle to become and remain subjects agents of their own histories persons who recognize the symbols and narratives that make up that history to be their symbols and narratives rather than an alienating imposition

4757178 i race against crocker all the time he has front half speed if i had half a bodylength i knew i would be fine when i saw crocker at the turn i knew cavic would be somewhere with him i could sort of see him out of the corner of my eye
4757179 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that cost me the race but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision it turned out to be in my favor
4757180 when people say things about that it just fires me up
4757181 it was like the 400 free relay one of the french swimmers alain bernard said something to get us going we use things like that comments like that to fuel us to get us even more excited thats what americans do we rise to the occasion when bob first told me that i said okay were going to let our swimming do the talking ill always welcome comments like that anyone who wants to say something i like it it definitely motivates me

4757196 im going to be teaching a graduate undergraduate course in the graphic novel this fall
4757197 as ive studied the genre it is clear that the development of the graphic novel divisions in the major publishing houses is a growing trend what are your hopes and concerns regarding this new development it is something that i want my students to consider seriously
4757198 were getting there we just have to have a dependable library of books that people can go to you know to get that shelf built up
4757199 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual any disruption by any athlete in particular a medallist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play
4757200 it should be noted that in front of the disciplinary commission the athlete never expressed any regret nor did he offer any apology for his actions
4757201 i think that he can be called michael the best olympian of all time more so not because he has more gold medals than anybody but in the way hes handled himself and in the way hes actually won under a tremendous amount of pressure
4757202 as soon as i took the last half stroke to be honest i thought i had lost the race
4757203 and that was the difference cause if i would have glided then i would have come up short ive been lucky enough over the last four years to have two pretty good finishes in olympic finals i guess im blessed
4757204 weve had about 12 come out and ive talked to about 40 of them

4757207 softball will be working for the next 13 months to gain the attention of the ioc that softball has the opportunity to regain its position in the olympic programme
4757208 there are problem areas we identified them and were going to work hard to solve them and move ahead
4757209 we are going to make sure that our campaign back softball gains the momentum towards the vote to convince the ioc that softball should be back on the olympic programme

4757223 great crested newts are an internationally protected species and this large colony is one of regional significance
4757224 from the development plans supplied to us we infer that a very high proportion of the existing great crested newt habitats will be lost

4757226 these days what makes a book y a is not so much what makes it as who makes it and the who is the marketing department
4757227 the county council has a particularly dismal record on consultation even more dismal when it comes to the waste incinerator which they have been secretive about the whole way
4757228 they still refuse to support the idea of having an open public enquiry
4757229 they wish to retain the ability to decide on the site of a new incinerator themselves and in their recent announcement that they are going to go back on a promise to reveal the sites they are considering they are showing contempt again for local people
4757230 the consultation is a sham and i believe just another example of them keeping information from the public
4757231 a great action shot so often bird pictures are static but this is electrifying
4757232 i was visiting the lake at wrentham when my attention was drawn to this incredible din on the water i immediately started taking photos of the squabbling gulls

4757234 its annoying for sailing as a sport it does not look good when you cant race because there is no wind
4757235 its not the sports fault its not the sailors fault its the fact that we have been put in this venue where we do not get any wind
4757236 with this venue we always knew it was going to be a bit like this i think you have to accept it and try not to let it wind you up to much
4757237 its only going to make the challenge harder for you

4757239 you know what they the springbok loose trio are going to do schalk burger certainly makes his physical presence felt in the way he hits first of all in defence and then the way he gets to the breakdown you certainly know hes there
4757240 australias george smith is a bit different in that he picks his times a bit more but when he does hit the ruck hes pretty effective
4757241 they smith and burger are different but its the same with me the way we operate depends whether we are going forwards or backwards at the breakdown that determines how well you can do your job
4757242 the whole game will be pretty physical to be honest its always the way when you play the springboks i know that whatever the score is everyones usually pretty sore at the after match but it hurts a lot less when you win
4757243 we had an extra day here without playing the week before so this test we have been thinking about a bit longer than usual so by wednesday it felt like the week was going pretty slow
4757244 but weve got all our preparation done and i think now the guys are just looking forward to playing this test you can only get so much done
4757245 im looking forward to it i cant wait three oclock kick off so it will come around really quickly tomorrow
4757246 he wants the gold obviously thats the sort of guy he is
4757247 hes done bloody well to come back there was no disappointment in athens but i think hes come back hungrier which is the sign of a champion hes going to fight for this one really hard sometimes people can walk away with silver and think thats good enough i think bevan really wants gold which is awesome
4757248 this new zealand team is a lot better placed this year than we were in athens
4757249 form is just a small piece of what happens out the other end but the guys and girls will be delivered to the start line in really good shape and from there theyve got to get the job done everything is in place its just about delivering on the day
4757250 its everything they dont have any heats or trials its one race and theyve got to get it right thats real hard to do but if anyone can these guys have got it all so its really exciting
4757251 theres no reason why he cant have a blinder and pop one out of the bag
4757252 the heat theyre going to face is really hard to race in it can just put you on your arse and you cant even see it coming but they would have trained for it and theyll be ready for it
4757253 the air can be very difficult to breathe and its quite soupy but as an athlete its one of those things you have no control over it so you just have to hope it doesnt affect you
4757254 its still very much a strength based course and the athletes that our guys are its going to suit them well
4757255 weve had some good discussions and were close to finalising a deal

4757257 its important for people to know that he williams and toulon contacted us
4757258 we havent gone chasing any of this we were prepared to take the matter to court and make him accountable and still are if an agreement is not reached
4757259 a financial settlement is going to be found at the beginning of next week
4757260 the fact he has decided not to defy the injunction sends a clear message to people who want to break their contract
4757261 how long he stays on the sidelines is one of the issues that has been raised
4757262 ive said on a few occasions that the issue is that not only does his departure impact on us on the field but also off the field
4757263 an impact across the whole business current and future players supporters sponsors we need to take all that into account on the next range of discussions with toulon
4757264 i came in with expectations of riding a personal best time it feels so great to have exceeded expectations

4757279 it is not my business it is the business for the board to talk about money
4757280 he is a fantastic player who could play in any team in the world but i am happy with my players at
4757281 we play 60 or 70 games a year so the door is always open for the players here and maybe one or two more in the future
4757282 cristiano has been doing excellently he is well ahead of schedule the specialist was surprised the condition he was in
4757283 the next three weeks he will have rehab and then the next part will be endurance work and serious running before he goes into the football side with us
4757284 there has been no problem his progress has been great he has never missed a session morning or afternoon we are pencilling him in for the beginning of october
4757285 at the start of last season i was asked if ronaldo could score more than 25 goals and i replied i was looking for improvement
4757286 improvement can come in different ways for ronaldo this season 42 goals is a target it is still possible for him to achieve that given the talent of the boy and his goalscoring ability but you have to say it is a big target
4757287 the idea is to put on the field to play our game in a way that is as similar as brazilian football as we can but i have players who are made for english football their characteristics are different
4757288 we will try to learn about dribbling controlling the ball passing the ball touching the ball and one twos but i need to respect the identity of the players and the quality of the players we have some players who play similar to those in brazil but others dont

4757341 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4757342 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4757343 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4757344 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4757345 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4757354 what ive heard is theres a real danger that the militias that are in the areas that the russians occupy may well be carrying out appalling atrocities reports are beginning to come in obviously we need the evidence but a very clear message needs to go out to the russians that while they are in control of this territory which they shouldnt be anything that happens there is their responsibility if atrocities have taken place they will be held to account for that

4757372 he will be our link man in the midfield and he has always been a very influential player
4757373 i have always had a lot of respect for him and i am delighted to have a player of his experience in the centre of my midfield and i am sure he will do very well for us
4757374 he has done all his coaching badges he was my first team coach and took all the training
4757375 he is well experienced and i am hoping that he does a good job
4757376 he has a very good squad there they are all pretty well tied down and committed to the club
4757377 somehow i dont see me having such a falling out with roy walker for a start ill be in the stand this time
4757378 it was my own fault the last time i was in the wrong and now im paying for it with a four game ban
4757379 im delighted to see roy walker back in the game and im sure that ballymena will benefit from his experience and knowledge of the game
4757380 theres absolutely no reason why we cant do just as well as we did last season
4757381 it is all down to the players and their attitude ive told them it is all about how much they want it and they are going to get out of it what they put into it again
4757382 i feel weve got a good balance this season good pace good wingers and people who can score us goals
4757383 it really is a tremendous honour to sign for a club of celtics stature
4757384 i am really looking forward to playing for a team that has such an incredible history and well known and passionate supporters
4757385 the club has enjoyed great success in recent years winning titles and cups
4757386 i am looking forward to the challenges here and hope to play my part in
4757387 were always asked what our target is for points and where we should finish but the only thing i am interested in at all is crusaders this afternoon
4757388 ive told the players that anything we get this year will be done through hard work if we get a point today or if we get all three it will down to sheer hard work
4757389 i told the boys at training on thursday night that the days of looking at the fixture list and thinking that we just have to turn up to get the points are well gone there are no easy games at all in this league
4757390 however we want to be in this league rather than out of it so you wont hear us complaining
4757391 theres no point in us pretending we know well be up against it
4757392 we know people might look to see when theyre playing ourselves or bangor as a chance for points but well let that motivate us
4757393 ive told the players to be comfortable with that and us it to our advantage
4757394 hopefully not too many teams will fancy coming down our place and we can use home advantage to our benefit
4757395 i just want to play football and when i wasnt playing it was hard for me
4757396 the transfer request was purely a football decision its not that i dont like linfield i just wasnt enjoying myself and i felt that i wanted to leave
4757397 the manager didnt want me to go and that was the case closed as far as i was concerned now i am a lot happier and am concentrating on playing and getting on with my linfield career
4757398 the injury happened so early in my time at linfield that i was just settling in and finding my feet
4757399 i dont think the linfield fans have seen the real me but now i am feeling really good i feel as fit as i did before i got injured and ive had a good pre season behind me
4757400 i was told that it would take me this long to get back to where i was before the cruciate and i trained all summer
4757401 hopefully now the linfield fans who have always been really good to me will see the best of me
4757402 you have to be at the top of your game all the time to stay in the team and everyone is fighting to get in and stay in
4757403 we all know the situation and it keeps you on your toes
4757404 every time i go out to play a game game of football i enjoy it and and you cant not enjoy champions league matches against a team of the quality of dinamo zagreb
4757405 i am like anyone else i play football to win things but thats not everything i just want to be in the team and playing and enjoying myself
4757406 last saturday we came down to train when we really should have had a match and there was a bit of lull in the atmosphere but weve trained really well during the week and everyone is raring to go now
4757407 a lot of teams have strengthened and there arent going to be too many easy matches if you take out the big two and cliftonville then there possibly half a dozen or more teams eyeing up those other three positions in the top six coleraine are one of those clubs and so we need to get the win and get the season up and running
4757408 i was very patchy when i came to newry and i take that on the chin but im going in now knowing ive got to deliver i owe coleraine one davy has been a very good mate of mine for a long time and he always seems to do that against me ive knocked a few past him over the years but hes denied me quite a lot as well
4757409 one thing about our new signings is that they are all young and they have a lot of years ahead of them im now the oldest player at the club and youre trying to set a good example im enjoying that aspect of it all the lads have impressed in pre season
4757410 i wasnt quite on top of the car for the first loop of three stages but we made changes to the suspension set up in service and i felt a lot more in control on stage four where we were fastest with no dramas
4757411 but its hard when you come up against that kind of opponent i tried my best but i probably shouldnt be out here even im four years ahead of myself 2012 are meant to be my games but im getting all the experience i need out here
4757412 the guys had warned me about his big right hand
4757413 but when i was stepping in i was laying my left hand down and he was landing the right hooks
4757414 hes a clever boxer just too good on the day once he got the lead he was very difficult to catch i had to walk onto him then and he was getting me with the big right but look 12 months ago all i was looking for was a senior championship so to be here at the olympics is way ahead of what i expected
4757415 john joe threw a couple of good left hands that i felt maybe deserved a score but the best man won
4757416 john joe likes to fight the fight that your man fought theyre both counter punchers
4757417 so whoever gets the lead then the other guy is chasing and unfortunately john joe had to do the chasing
4757418 i have to keep positive this time two years ago id never even ridden a track bike and never been on a velodrome
4757419 i dont have the answers right now for what went wrong today but in the last kilometre i had nothing
4757420 i think theyd like to give you a hug and tell you how proud they are of you
4757421 im trying to let him win but he just cant f g beat me
4757422 i told him how proud i was of him i know i am hard on him at times in the corner and i was hard on him last night
4757423 but he turned a five point deficit into a two point lead and you know when you look into a fellas eyes if youre looking into a hollow shell
4757424 but i could see that john joe wanted to win that fight he was really looking for help and i just wanted him to keep his hands up we nearly pulled it off too you know in the last six months this guy has come on in leaps and bounds as a person not just as an athlete hes a lovely gentleman maybe too gentle at times
4757425 a bit of a freak show all shapes and sizes all walks of life in there
4757426 i can remember from my own experience trying to go back home and get into a normal routine again it was very very difficult some of my team mates struggled as well i remember the girlfriend of one actually ringing my wife
4757427 jesus i cant get this fella to stay in any night she was complaining it just played tricks with your head and the boys went through the same thing when we got here from sparring camp in vladivostok
4757428 i just felt in the state i was in i wouldnt be any good to anybody
4757429 its very very strange when youve been on the inside for the whole five years to be taken out at this point
4757430 it happened in athens too but i didnt feel it as much because the programme was only 13 months old but this is very difficult
4757431 we are a team even though ive been taken out of the loop the team has still operated very effectively were very very close but not being in there in the village not being able to take accreditation for a team that i have led for the last five years is very very difficult personally
4757432 still we felt that it was important we didnt make an issue out of it because it would only impact on the boxers im happy that the team are disappointed im not there but im also glad that its not affecting them i wasnt going to get into any piss fight with people
4757433 i find it really difficult going into the stadium and being a spectator
4757434 thursday night i was up in the roof practically screaming the corner cant get away with it but i can and the boxers tell me they hear my voice
4757435 but the worst thing for me is feeling like youve been cut off the team have made it a lot easier but in the morning im waving goodbye to the physio and the psychologist going up to the village they come back with the stories every night but you just keep your chin up and you smile through it
4757436 the important thing is that the boxers look as if they belong here they look comfortable in their shoes and its taken us a long time to get to that point
4757437 if we can keep them there we can do big things people have been pushing us all week for medal talk but were not biting you see we know how hard these medals are to come by and it has amazed us really how tough some of our journey has proved to just get this far
4757438 to hear some of our own organisation talking about how many medals we were going to bring home this kind of stuff that just tells you that people really dont understand how difficult it is out here
4757439 but i have the quality i have robin van persie emmanuel adebayor nicklas bendtner who i have been patiently building up to be at the level i want him to be i have carlos vela eduardo da silva
4757440 i am able to make signings at very high prices but you have to have the cohesion in the way you buy
4757441 i have the money available to buy the players but we go into the competition with the target of balancing the budget which i think every manager should do
4757442 the quality of a manager is spotting players when they are not necessarily stars big signings reassure fans but good performances are better
4757443 you have to have a belief that you can win otherwise why bother turning up
4757444 every season is the season you have to win something
4757445 despite what we tend to read i do not think we have ever been closer than we are now
4757446 mike ashley has come out and said in his own words how he sees the club where he is with the club and that was a good thing to do because it stopped all this well hes thinking of selling
4757447 i think we are a long way from there now we all understand our roles we all understand what each others brief is and what each of us brings to the club that is a good thing we are never going to agree on everything six or seven guys in a room talking about football but the important thing is when we dont agree it stays in the room
4757448 it is a great feeling that the manager at portsmouth has a great deal of confidence in me
4757449 that breeds confidence in me i really believe that when the manager puts so much faith in me i respond better to that
4757450 it would be quite simple to not do too much
4757451 it would be quite easy to sit there and come off the bench for liverpool now and then you get paid the same if you are part of the big club you can pretend to lift trophies its quite easy to do that its certainly not in my nature at the end of my career i could say i have won this and i have won that but looking at myself in the mirror have i really won that thats certainly something that crossed my mind when i decided to leave i thought i cannot look myself in the mirror and say i have actually won that if i have not been part of the team
4757452 i have no grudge against the manager rafa benitez when he started playing one up front he was always going to play fernando torres and it was not something that i had any qualms about
4757453 but when he played two up front i felt myself and torres were a good combination
4757454 there are loads that stand out winning the fa cup was one a hat trick against arsenal when we won 4 1 in march 2007 the scissor kick goal in the champions league against galatasaray in 2006 knocking manchester united out of the fa cup in 2006 getting to the champions league final that moment when we beat chelsea in the semis great great memories every goal i scored in front of the kop you just cant beat that feeling
4757455 its difficult i didnt go back in i spoke to a lot of the lads on the phone i called a lot of the staff the girl on reception the kit man they all wished me well i had a good relationship with them and i hope i can go back there with my head held high you have to keep pushing on in every single game and at the end of your career you can look through the photos and the tapes and say that was great we did this we did that but at the moment i have to keep looking forward not back because it will leave you behind
4757456 he knows football inside out he has that knowledge he is good tactically but he is good with people if youve had a bad game he will tell you straight to your face you were crap today if you have done really well for him and he is really pleased he will give you a big pat on the back and tell you youre the best player in the world you feel great and you want to go out the next week and do the same you just dont want to let him down its a simple effective way of getting the best out of his players
4757457 jermain will always score goals i always believe i will so there is a partnership there
4757458 jermain has the pace to make clever little runs in behind and score goals if an out ball is needed or a target is needed im there and i think we can balance the best of both of our attributes
4757459 basically i go into every game believing i can score and if it doesnt materialise then i am disappointed if i havent scored it hurts and i want to make sure the next time if the ball is played in early i can bring other players in what i thrive on is crosses into the box and when teams do that i have always scored goals if we do that then im very confident i will get my fair share
4757460 i would like to be irreplaceable like torres stevie gerrard jamie carragher players who play every week in a massive club but that wasnt working out for me ive come to portsmouth and hopefully i can get a good run of games play under the new manager and enjoy it when im playing every week any player will tell you thats when you become a better player and more confident
4757461 i think i have changed a lot of peoples opinions over the years i feel settled playing for portsmouth living in this part of the country and i hope i can see out the four years on my contract and more i believe i can have the best years of my career here
4757462 you can say good morning and he replies but if you dont speak to him he does speak to you we need to put fire in anelka i need to work in his head
4757463 he lampard said to me mister i have signed for five years and i said great because i am here for two and maybe more and maybe we talked about how he could be my assistant after that
4757464 hes a great player for chelsea and a symbol of the club he doesnt need to say anything about me he only needs to help me in the field
4757465 the idea is to put on the field to play our game as similar as brazilian football as we can
4757466 but i have players who are made for english football the characteristics are different we try to learn things about dribbling control the ball pass the ball touch the ball one twos we try we have some players who play similar to those in brazil but others not
4757467 if you dont win people forget that you played very well people kill you i know this you can play very well for one or two months then you dont win then its over
4757468 the head of our state has made it clear that the georgian side appearing in the future as peacekeepers is now after what has happened unacceptable to south ossetia
4757469 equally important he is a quality young man who comes from a very strong family we appreciate their trust in the pirates organization pedro is a high end talent we are excited to add him to our system and about the potential impact he can have
4757470 pirates owner bob nutting has made a commitment to provide the club with the tools and resources necessary to return the pirates to the greatness that this organization has achieved so often in its rich history
4757471 he has further demonstrated that commitment by his active involvement throughout this process and by providing us with the significant dollars necessary to sign
4757472 ni chomok chhu tak claashh wo yi jing gen ni jiang bu ke yi takk clashh ni de bu ke yi de mehhh
4757473 what do you do its race day theyre there to win and we had c newitt on and he isnt going to lay down
4757474 so i just thought i had the horse right for a good performance
4757475 i would have been happy if he got beaten hell sleep well tonight though
4757476 things have gone wrong with weekend hussler this week and i just need to go on from here and win the cox plate
4757477 its always a good sign when they run well first up and it couldnt have been a better performance
4757478 its great for racing i just hope they keep doing the bonecrusher our waverley star thing but i just need to be bonecrusher
4757479 im glad to say hes improved each day the condition is that hes stabilised
4757480 the concern is the infection and they are still puzzled as to what it is they think now its a viral infection and the concern is his lungs
4757481 he is under the care of the leading cardiopulmonary specialist in the asia pacific area
4757482 each day hes shown improvement and in the last 24 hours has improved quite considerably and the intake from the ventilator has been reduced and hes breathing a lot better under his own steam
4757483 hes far from being out of the woods hes still in intensive care and he will be in hospital for some time but the most important thing is that he continues to improve

4757516 the executive board also discussed on how to resolve outstanding political issues including the law of provincial council elections stressing that the solution to the ways these issues should not come through the constitution and the law
4757517 we discussed the subject of election law provincial assemblies and now we have the agenda on issues fateful the strategic consultation and work will begin by wishing that
4757518 i came to check on the health of vice president of the republic which is in good health and we have agreed to communicate the debate on important issues in iraq now
4757519 the consultations are about to agree on a final version of the law and to present a positive atmosphere
4757520 we hope to end a compromise solution satisfactory to all parties and we expect to reach agreement in the coming days the law will be put to a vote early next month
4757521 with regard to preparations on the independent electoral commission attiya pointed out that unhcr continues to work and organizational and logistical preparations for holding the elections on schedule before the end of this year pointing out that
4757522 the best prospects for political leaders not only to absorb this position and exit solution satisfactory to the various parties
4757523 most of the differences in paragraph 24 of the act was agreed upon and remained only the issue of safeguards must be found solutions
4757524 i think that the iraqi forces succumb to the agreement it wants or not to establish clear criteria for all provinces
4757525 after the parliament vote on the law of provincial council elections despite the refusal of the kurdistan alliance is incumbent upon us to reconsider our alliances in the future

4757542 a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
4757543 what is required is a very strong response to what is happening in georgia if we just stand by after what russia has done in georgia then where next will russia intervene

4757556 muir weaves commentary thoughtful analyses and humor into a true art form
4757557 muirs genius lies in his giving context to the films
4757558 as a critic muir is acute in his analysis and as a writer he is easy to read
4757559 well grounded in the love and minutiae of sci fi and fantasy adventure
4757560 john kenneth muirs books for mcfarland are distinctive because of their authority and effective research
4757561 he really scrapes beneath the surface of the film and looks for the subtext every nuance is analysed

4757587 the michigan legislators determined that it would be handled in this way
4757588 they the panthers starters only played a series or two last week he switched sides this year so there wasnt a whole lot of film from his playing the right side i studied as much as i could
4757589 i didnt notice peppers much we chipped a blocking technique early and todd obviously had a handful of plays where he was by himself with him it looked like he did ok
4757590 i feel like because i had one of my better camps it was easier for the coaches to let me play tackle
4757591 i feel like they werent as worried about me playing guard it gives us more options i guess

4757596 when we sustain drives and move the ball downfield we have to come out with touchdowns thats the most important thing in this game

4757598 shes unique shes afflicted with crippling depression the elephant sanctuary is the right choice
4757599 why would we want her last years to be in a drive through zoo in mexico when she could have 300 acres in the lush tennessee countryside
4757600 if we stripped everything away and say what is in the best interest of jenny the sanctuary would win hands down

4757624 valeri is looking strong and has the potential to be a match winner this year we are looking to bring him on and give him more game time

4757640 hey everyone go buy some stuff at the mall stop trying to sell your house and stop shorting us stocks
4757641 you know thats interesting and i just heard a bird singing a song about the need to look into enviromental devastation on a more local level and pointing to the simple fact that smog water pollution and bloated landfills can be more clearly seen without graphs and charts and addressed regionally less abstract in a sense its a good point
4757642 its all knit neatly together of course if only humankind would dare to consider the fact that they are not only creatures of society and culture but indeed also creatures of nature it is difficult to them now isnt it
4757643 but thats the key if they were to accept that theyre creatures of nature living in big cities like ant hills or bee hives and affecting nature in such a lot of ways i think there would be a glimmer of hope to be spotted but theyre so involved with the metaphors the symbols and the logos of theirs its just fabulous
4757644 and this would probably be the reason why it is impossible for these people to agree on the emissions levels of co2 and other toxic gases as well dont you think just in case of one local economy made this thing or that start to happen over there i hear they are going to meet in bangkok soon where they are probably going to continue talking about how to stress the importance of the kyoto agreement and the ipccs climate science but not do something significant about it
4757645 another great opportunity lost another great idea turned to waste that would be such a shame you know
4757646 the prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by the prohibition law for nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced it is an open secret that the dangerous increase of crime in this country is closely connected with this
4757647 it all makes sense now the bunker full of heavy deserts truffles with cyanide and whipping cream the leather belts and whips eva braun and her kinky outfit hitler was into crazy masochistic sex and violence and rich food just like napoleon just as i always thought
4757648 hitler didnt kill himself he and eva ate a combination of rich food that had just a hint too much cyanide and it clogged their arteries during a blistering orgy those sex crazed nazis only julia child could have set them up like that now i see it clearly
4757649 julia didnt bring down hitler she was lucky to bake a potato in an ethical manner
4757650 if she brought hitler down then she did a better job at that than her fake british accent i know shes really hispanic thats why the u s let her do that pbs tv show
4757651 so how are these people going to go about saving the planet from all sorts of environmental devastation if they are hardly even allowed to call the planet their home but lead their entire lives tied down to some metaphorical nation state entity
4757652 youre damned right about that theyve got to connect with the fact that theyre disturbing the ecosystems of this planet on a global scale as well as a local one theyve got to connect with the fact that planet earth is their planetary home
4757653 and yet they do nothing about it am i right
4757654 i thought so you know this species is never going to stop amazing me as a matter of fact it is going to amaze me ceaselessly
4757655 thats too bad theyd better make a clean break with the nation state system if they are going to succeed here they should
4757656 now they have the internet and theyve got all these satelites so communication should not be a problem it makes you wonder whats keeping them from coming together and dissolving a few symbols and metaphors dont you think
4757657 so what if nature itself decided for them to take notice of global climate change challenges would that be possible

4757663 the task of cutting greenhouse gas emissions enough to avert a dangerous rise in global temperatures may be far more difficult than previous research suggested say scientists who have just published studies indicating that it would require the world to cease carbon emissions altogether within a matter of decades
4757664 the question is what if we dont want the earth to warm anymore asked carnegie institution senior scientist ken caldeira co author of a paper published last week in the journal geophysical research letters the answer implies a much more radical change to our energy system than people are thinking about although many nations have been pledging steps to curb emissions for nearly a decade the worlds output of carbon from human activities totals about 10 billion tons a year and has been steadily rising
4757665 unless we are all supposed to come to believe there will be new technological fixes to the problems of emissions from oil gas and coal on a relatively short notice
4757666 the question is what if we dont want the earth to warm anymore
4757667 the task of cutting greenhouse gas emissions enough to avert a dangerous rise in global temperatures may be far more difficult than previous research suggested say scientists who have just published studies indicating that it would require the world to cease carbon emissions altogether within a matter of decades
4757668 their findings published in separate journals over the past few weeks suggest that both industrialized and developing nations must wean themselves off fossil fuels by as early as mid century in order to prevent warming that could change precipitation patterns and dry up sources of water worldwide
4757669 the world must bring carbon emissions down to near zero to keep temperatures from rising further
4757670 the question is what if we dont want the earth to warm anymore
4757671 the answer implies a much more radical change to our energy system than people are thinking about
4757672 people arent reducing emissions at all let alone debating whether 88 percent or 99 percent is sufficient said gavin a schmidt of nasas goddard institute for space studies

4757691 were pretty much planning on running the world of outlaws late model series tour for the rest of the season
4757692 were going to try and run for the rookie of the year and hit other selected races were not just going to do outlaw races only if there is an xtreme race within reason that we can get to well do some of them if theres a macs or southern all star race or something within reason well go to them too and like eldora the first race well get to the second one probably not
4757693 what little bit weve done its like i have told you before the guys in late models are a little more relaxed than some of the guys i run against up north but with these guys if there are 60 cars at a track the talent level is second to none the people are actually fun to be around and i dont know if its because it is new to us but were excited to do it and im tickled to be mentioned in the same breath as some of the 50 or 60 top guys in the country
4757694 were not going to just run world of outlaws and thats it
4757695 were not in any battle if there is something close by and it makes financial sense to go do it were going whether they are macs or southern allstars well hit as many as we can
4757696 its weird but they changed the points in the dirt modifieds this year and out of the 28 series races im going to run 23 of them and then come labor day ill probably run the last six or seven modified shows because by then our late model season will be wrapping up there will only be about five races left but were planning on hitting all of them
4757697 some are on wednesdays and thursdays and on any conflicting dates and im out on the road we wont go to some of them weve looked into flights and things for some of them and if i can make it back then well look at that too like when we go to say north dakota after the first show ill fly back to evans mills which will be my home track on thursday nights and then turn around and fly back to get to iowa to get to the next outlaw show so im going to be busy but its what i do
4757698 i dont know if ill ever get an opportunity to run two series and actually get in the points in both series and maybe make some money and maybe further my career along if we have some success hopefully we can get out and do some things like that and maybe down the road it will be better for us with some other things
4757699 its weird its almost like starting again in my modified stuff we had some good runs and now everyone wants us to do it
4757700 if it wasnt for carl and ann myers saying basically we can do whatever we want to do as far as racing and even teammate vic coffey but man everyone is excited carl is excited ann is excited vic the whole team is fired up about it but without ann and carl we wouldnt be able to do the modified races so i thank them for the modfified opportunity and for giving us the chance to go out on the road with this late model deal
4757701 myself and tommy grecco theres just us two and were both in our late 20s and for them to give us all this equipment and trust us with all this equipment and put a professional race team together and allow us to go out on the road and race with the big boys they must have a lot of faith in us and i thank them for that
4757702 mike and mickeys dedication to the sport of dirt track racing paid payoff with their induction into the national dirt late model hall of fame
4757703 everyone with the series truly sends out our heartfelt congratulations to both mike and mickey
4757704 having known the swims family for a number of years i know they are respectfully thankful to good lord above and to all the fans promoters and drivers who make this the most exciting form of racing out there and i know they will not rest on their laurels as they want to continue to put on some of the best shows in all of dirt track racing at rome and dixie speedways
4757705 i want to congratulate mike and his father for their induction into the national dirt late model hall of fame
4757706 mike has been a valuable asset to the lucas oil late model dirt series and i have a great deal of respect for him and his passion for dirt late model racing
4757707 he brings a credibility to the sport of sprint car racing
4757708 i am not a total neophyte to what the world of outlaws was all about
4757709 so i did have some semblance of a working knowledge and its like everybody has told me no matter who i talk to and i keep in close touch with my winston cup buddies who i work with ill tell them ill be in charlotte or wherever for a world of outlaws show and theyll say thats great racing everybody says the same thing that it is great racing and it is
4757710 its been very good racing and it s been exciting and the thing i find very different about it is the length of the races obviously that was the biggest adjustment for me after two hours of the telecast we re going off the air and im just warming up laughs especially when you compare it to being on the air for five hours at dover or the coca cola 600 race at charlotte or whatever
4757711 an eight lap or 12 lap event or even a 30 lap event you turn around and your night is done so all this great action is being crammed into two and two and a half hours but it s been good i enjoy it and ive been overwhelmed by the amount of stuff i have to learn
4757712 other than the fact they have four wheels and a steering wheel there is no similarity to what i have lived for the last 26 or 27 years so i have been working hard and doing my studying and dealing with brad and dealing with our historian in the booth kevin eckert he is invaluable in his help
4757713 its coming along ive got a long way to go yet ive only done a couple three races and my comfort factor is still not where it needs to be but its coming along and the racing is fine its great its just my comfort level with all that has gone on and the history of the sport thats where i am automatically kind of on edge when i walk into the booth my history bank in nascar is fairly extensive where my history bank with dirt track racing of any sort is really very limited
4757714 so its a lot of work a lot of work
4757715 brad has been a wonderful help i bet he wishes he had a dollar for every question ive asked him and even when he is not formally giving me answers to questions he is still such a big help just by listening to him talk about something we can be sitting around and such and such might have happened whatever it might be and hell say you know we had the same thing at sharon speedway back in 1978 and yadda yadda yadda whereas i could have said well we had a deal like that back at north wilkesboro back in 1976
4757716 he has that kind of encyclopedic memory and knowledge about sprint car racing even when were just talking in general im jotting down notes because you never know when something might come up and hes just been a wonderful wonderful friend to work with he really has there is nothing that you can ask regardless of how elementary that he wont give a complete answer to hes really trying to help me learn and thats great
4757717 the response has been nice and it feels good it really does
4757718 im not much of one to go on these internet bulletin boards and chat rooms but i have i dont do it in nascar i just dont do it but i have after our first three world of outlaws telecasts just to get the temperature of the viewers and youre right the response has been good
4757719 and of course there will always be some people who dont like your work and thats true in anything but i think the fans and viewers respect the fact that i am not coming in trying to play the part of the expert fans see through that i could not bluster my way through and i think they respect the fact that i am doing a ton of homework
4757720 i dont this that or the other but i ll be a son of a gun if by the time the red light goes on the camera that i dont have it written down in front of me and if i don t have a complete answer i can lean on kevin eckert our historian in the booth who has gobs and gobs of information
4757721 i am not one of these guys who is afraid to take input from other people and give them credit on the air which i have done with kevin i did the same thing in nascar and again i have done 26 years of nascar between radio and television and had a gentleman named bill svoboda who traveled with us in nascar again not everybody knows everything and so if i used a guy in nascar after being there for 26years i sure as heck am going to try and find the best available person for the world of outlaws after only being there for three races so we e working at it
4757722 were not just showing up sitting down and fluffing our way through a fairly easy two hour telecast brad is doing his work i am doing my work and were trying to give the viewer as complete and as extensive coverage that they can get we respect the world of outlaws no i havent been a sprint car man my whole life but that doesnt mean i cant respect drag racing or imsa or cart or irl or the world of outlaws i respect them all and if i am on the air they will get my very best effort possible
4757723 like i said before doc its been great and i think it will just get better
4757724 he obviously didnt know a lot about sprint car racing at first but he is definitely a quick learner and i m surprised at how fast he has caught on but i guess racing is racing he brings a real credibility to the sport of sprint car racing he is very well known in racing and nascar and has done nothing but help sprint car racing as far as i m concerned
4757725 sprint car fans are pretty critical and they love this sport and theyre the most knowledgeable fans of any sport i think and i think they might have been somewhat concerned with how he would portray the sport and thats ok i think he has proven he is a true professional and has brought that credibility and deserves to be there i think he does an outstanding job and i m not just saying that its been great it really has
4757726 but i wont lie if there are two races going on the same night one was nascar winston cup and one was sprint cars i would probably still go to the winston cup race because that is what i grew up on the same way dave argabright would go to an open wheel race because that is what he grew up on
4757727 but was i disappointed that i was not in town when the world of outlaws ran at the talledega short track yes as a matter of fact i tried to rearrange my travel schedule around i was going out of town to do an arena football game and i tried to change my travel schedule around so i could see the world of outlaws at the talledega short track and unfortunately i wasnt able to
4757728 so yes i am a fan ive known steve kinser for years i got to know him when he ran with us a number of seasons ago i know sammy swindell from his nascar days i know a number of drivers i have met over the years just like i know a bunch of drag racing guys but yes i am a fan of the sport there is no doubt
4757729 its not rocket science its just plain old common sense and one of the most important aspects of getting the word out about dirt late model racing is for individual teams to start taking a more active role in media relations
4757730 if each and every team would commit to take an active progressive approach to spreading the news then everyone involved in dirt late model racing would benefit it only takes a commitment to spend a couple of hours each week contacting their local regional media to keep them abreast of their own activities either by phone personal visits or press releases
4757731 then the efforts of publicists for individual tracks sanctions and sports writers already in tune with dirt late model racing would be multiplied but every team has to take action whether they hire a publicity service to achieve these goals or have a team or family member do it things will remain the same until more teams take an active role
4757732 i cannot for the life of me understand why it has taken so long for teams to figure this out especially when teams that are doing it are garnering tremendous media coverage outside of the world of dirt late model racing
4757733 the series and sanctions are doing their jobs for the most part its time now for the race teams and tracks to add fuel to the fire and actively work the media while also making concerted efforts to make impressions that can drive more media and civic focus to this exciting segment of the sport they arent going come to you you have to actively pursue these channels and get busy or have someone do it for you
4757734 throw the egos in the trashcan and understand that at the end of the day dirt late model racing is still a hidden american treasure if you want it to grow then get after it if you dont want to take an active role then quit crying about why television and the mainstream media dont cover your events
4757735 what reasons are you giving them to cover you whos out there pitching storylines whos out there showing solid demographic numbers and getting in the face of corporate decision makers like i said it aint rocket science but it takes action not words but action from six in the morning until midnight and then some
4757736 hopefully the major teams will all make a commitment to get on track with these efforts
4757737 no doubt i would like to add a dozen or so additional clients to our daily grind but a team or family member can get the job done if they are willing to it just takes planning commitment and follow through if there are teams out there who dont want to invest in a publicity service thats fine but they need to do it in house and do it on a consistent and continuing basis
4757738 maybe these folks dont know quite how to go about it then there are people like us who are glad to lend them a hand help show them the ropes but the bottom line is that it is something that has not received the proper attention that is needed from the teams it is their responsibility to their own efforts and to the sport
4757739 can you imagine what type of positive impact it would have for promoters
4757740 dirt late model racing has not even hit on 3 cylinders when it comes to working the media creating marketing partnerships and forging ahead with promotional concepts that drive people to the racetrack and drive customers to retail locations to buy products and services provided by sponsoring companies its the choice of the teams involved
4757741 it is going to grow even more during the coming season its inevitable as long as teams make the most out of their visits to markets and make a positive impact with the media and local commerce in the area of tracks at which they compete
4757742 the economic conditions should continue to drive more fans back to the grass roots of stock car racing which should continue to broaden the fan base
4757743 with the competition level at an all time high and the personalities of the drivers making it appealing to the general race entertainment fan the allure of dirt late model racing is pure excitement the drivers realize the loyalty of the core fans and continue to concentrate on making impressions on the media and motorsports industry that are positive for the sport dirt late model fans continuing to share their love of this type of racing with fans of other sports and other types of racing will also impact the growth
4757744 oh yes because dirt is so much a part of american stock car racing
4757745 you go through the national speedway directory and start counting up the number of dirt tracks there are far more dirt tracks in this country than asphalt tracks and when you go to some of these facilities and you take a look at the quality of cars and quality of drivers and the action you see at these events more of it becomes apparent why this whole thing is so popular so yes we get very positive reaction when we run dirt track stories
4757746 i watched him race and i was very impressed with his car control i was very impressed with the way he handles himself
4757747 i was impressed with him top to bottom and he absolutely gets the job done in the race car and he handles himself incredibly well with other competitors and it just seemed to me as if this guy should be the story and then you watch him race and see how incredibly good he is in these events and why not its a hell of a story
4757748 just about everything chub does and the people who surround him impresses me
4757749 they just go one step beyond what everyone else does and they do it better
4757750 my impression was it was just an incredibly good event
4757751 i liked the fact that it was a renegade xtreme get together i thought that was a very positive thing the rest of it im still trying to figure out how the hell those guys drive those cars laughs you watch chub or you watch scott bloomquist or rick eckert or any of those guys and those cars are so frickin cranked out of shape and you watch them and they are sideways and so violent
4757752 i stood in the second turn with rick schwallie for a while and i also stood outside the second turn and just watching how out of control those things are its just an amazing thing to me as a former driver that they dont have half of them on their lid in every feature event its just really quite remarkable that they can keep them of their lid as much as they do
4757753 it was exciting then but what i think were seeing now is so much more so the bizarre chassis that these guys are running with the rear roll steer that causes the left front tire to pick up in the corners we didnt see that stuff in robert smalleys era but what we still have that we had at that time is a remarkable cast of characters i mean youve got good guys and bad guys you got young guys you got old guys youve got experienced people and rookies anything you would want to hang your hat on from the perspective of finding somebody or some team or some car to cheer for or somebody to hate laughs
4757754 t was there in robert smalleys time and its there now i think the difference between then and now is robert smalley had perhaps better methods of exploiting all of that he was as you know an incredible showman and brought a certain sense of carnival to the events that he promoted which are absent today and which i frankly miss
4757755 i think of the whole thing like the interviews he used to do on the front straightaway wearing that checkered vest of his and the near naked trophy women he had around and all the hoopla and excitement and all the stuff he generated is missing today and it shouldnt be missing because the activity itself the driving the cars the events are all more exciting now than it was in roberts era and id like to see some of that color return
4757756 i think its very healthy at this point especially dirt late model racing
4757757 there are some elements of dirt track racing that is in flux like the deal with the dirt group out of new york is a specific example of where they are in the process of a sale and there is a real flux there and i have real concerns where dirt modifieds are going imca on the other hand appears to be rock solid and they are doing extremely well and the majority of their deals are on dirt and thats a great concept it gives a lot of people a chance to race i see the advent of crate engines as something that is going to happen very quickly a lot of facilities are going to have them i think the bottom line statement is yes dirt track racing is very healthy
4757758 its an unqualified success and in todays environment a magazine that has survived for four years is something of a historic event
4757759 something like 75 of all magazines fail within the first year of launch and we are nearing our completion of four continuous years of publishing speedway illustarted and were looking for about 40 or 50 more so from that perspective its an unqualified success
4757760 im going to be doing fox television beginning with rockingham
4757761 unfortunately the nbc guys its their turn to do daytona we hate to let that happen but thats the way the contract is written so ill start at rockingham working for fox tv working from pit road and then ill also continue with speedway illustrated magazine we generate a lot of frequent flyer miles you can only imagine
4757762 i dont miss it because im around it so much
4757763 i miss driving the cars certainly i drove myself for 20 years and i never quite got over the idea i couldnt do it anymore even though that is the reality of the situation the rest of it once we get off the air with fox i hit the road and i start hitting racetracks all over the country and get a chance to see a lot of people race i get a very long season out of it as a result
4757764 as a matter of fact last weekend i was at homestead the weekend before that at irwindale california so i get around and i dont miss it because i make it a point to be on an airplane virtually every weekend or on my motorcycle and off to see some races somewhere
4757765 but the best i ran against regularly were eph davis jack norris wimpy yarman and joe carney i preferred open wheel cars but i won more races in the late models
4757766 well i remember competing in a demolition derby one time and two days later i was real sore
4757767 but the most special night was when kenneth and i both won features the same night
4757768 i put him in and let him go you couldnt hardly see his head sticking up above the dashboard he was doing pretty good though until my dad pete happened to see who was driving boy did he ever chew me out
4757769 i flipped in the first corner on the first lap of qualifying the first night i drove a racecar
4757770 i was racing the old 066 sidewinder that kenny started in in the heat race i must have been fiddling around but kenny was there watching and when i went into the pits he said when the green flag drops stand on it so in the feature i took his advice they dropped the green i stood on it and hit the car in front of me who spun out i hit him so hard i knocked the engine out of his car
4757771 the year dean and i battled it out at wayne county for first and second
4757772 i still picture grandpa watching races and calhoun glenn davisson watering the track as kids dean and i used to go over to the track the next morning and find money and whatever else we could drag home
4757773 i still remember dad winning a race and grandpa handing him a trophy
4757774 competitively the thing i remember most was dad in the 066 kicking butt as far as my feelings go there wasnt a better race car driver in the world than when my dad raced
4757775 of course mom wasnt so bad herself she raced jim gentrys 14 late model a lot she won a bunch of races and i remember her winning quite a few in gentrys car holding that checkered flag and that beautiful smile she was probably the person who made the checker flag she was holding
4757776 getting coverage in mainstream papers isnt easy because many papers dont have anyone on staff who understands racing
4757777 they dont have a good barometer to determine whats newsworthy so sometimes they dont cover anything at all
4757778 one way to get around this especially for weekly newspapers or small dailies is to get someone one your team to volunteer to send in results thats obviously a lot of work but it might smooth the way for the newspaper to begin providing more coverage
4757779 another thing is to make sure and let the media know if something newsworthy is going on perhaps your team won four races in a row or your driver went straight from his daughters high school graduation to the racetrack and won anything out of the ordinary might catch an editors eye particularly if it has a good people angle
4757780 be sure and dont badger editors too often or theyll dismiss your requests but if you call a couple of times of a year with story ideas youll probably get some attention and dont just look out for your own team let them know if theres another interesting story at the track the more familiar they get with racing the more coverage youll get
4757781 we dont use 80 of the weekly press releases we receive because of space but there are times when we have extra space that we will put press releases in so in having someone that does a weekly press release or a monthly newsletter the most important thing is persistence also if a driver or a team runs in a particular series this is a very good way to receive coverage most series advertise with newspapers and magazines and when they submit an article there is a better chance it will make that weeks paper
4757782 for our magazine all were looking for is a good story
4757783 that can mean big wins a breakout season or just some unique aspect of a race team dry statistics rarely make good reading but a new team or major change in program often does
4757784 a driver such as earl pearson jr whos been on the verge of a breakout for so long having a career season was another good example of what were looking for but it doesnt have to be on the national level we recently ran a feature on ray guss jr a successful veteran who has cut back on his program and gone back to racing locally that kind of thing is interesting to most readers
4757785 the human element is also important there are few things more interesting to readers than a racer who has to overcome adversity in order to compete the bottom line is people are always more interesting than numbers
4757786 if youre trying to draw attention to yourself you should let people know when something interesting is going on with a couple thousand or so late model teams out there those of us in the press never know everything thats going on sometimes you just have to tell us youd be surprised how many stories are generated in our pages by a team member friend or family member contacting me to tell me something interesting about some driver or team its generally that simple
4757787 working for a racing publication were looking for interesting stories and angles that we havent seen before
4757788 obviously were going to cover the sports top racers and the guys who are winning but interesting stories particularly an angle that involves non racing people stories is what everyone wants to read
4757789 most nights at the track we circulate and chat with whoever kinda fishing for such information even the littlest notion about something we get from talking to drivers or crewmembers or family members might turn into a neat story thats the best stuff because few newspapers have the manpower and desire to chase the difficult stories
4757790 so heres a tip if something of interest is going on make sure someone whos writing knows about it be familiar with local and racing media so you can chat and share information with them because drivers are sometimes oblivious to what a writer thinks is interesting
4757791 its not coincidence that the chattiest and most personable drivers bill frye bob pierce and others often get good publicity its because they recognize an interesting story and know how to tell a good one too
4757792 i find them useful to supplement a race report but i must admit i dont read through all of them every time
4757793 one complaint i have is that some of the reports are three paragraphs regardless of what happened in other words just by glancing you cant tell the difference between the week the driver dropped out with a 22nd place finish or the week he won a 10 000 race
4757794 my suggestion is to skip the weeks when theres nothing newsworthy and when your driver does something noteworthy file a lengthy report with quotes details and notes that reporters wont get from the typical track report that could spark an interview request or at least someone adding to a race story and bringing more publicity for the driver
4757795 i would always encourage a race team to send out press releases
4757796 the more the media knows about someone and or knows someone personally the better the chance is that there press release will be printed newsletters need to be sent to fans and sponsors more than the media when someone walks up to your trailer to take a picture of your racecar or buy a t shirt ask them if they would like to receive a monthly newsletter keep a box in the trailer write down their name and addresses
4757797 to me they are largely just another thing i have to delete from my email on a daily basis
4757798 it doesnt do me any good to know where joe schmoe is going to race this coming weekend i understand that sponsors need to be kept in the loop and thats where those things are probably most needed i occasionally use bits from driver press releases for short news items like usually the launching of a new website or something newsworthy like that that being said i wouldnt discourage teams from using them but id be careful about what i considered newsworthy perhaps
4757799 motorsports is the number one spectator sport in america with over 52 million fans across the country
4757800 the supply of sporting events has been outstripped by demand from potential sponsors advertisers
4757801 motorsports is attracting increased attention from major advertisers as a way to reach a new audience
4757802 the rule of thumb is that putting 1 000 behind a race event or race team will generate the same exposure as 10 000 in advertising
4757803 motorsports advertising sponsorship offers another bonus the chance to entertain clients customers and employees by throwing a bash at the event itself
4757804 motorsports advertising sponsorship is a medium thats open to purchase and companies are buying
4757805 what brings large and growing crowds to motorsports the answer is noise and showmanship horsepower and performance
4757806 you need to approach this as part of your business and not as a hobby
4757807 what i mean by that is first impressions are everything spend a little time and money on a professional looking proposal be creative the more it catches the attention and eye of a potential sponsor the better the chances of someone meeting with you on the possibilities of sponsoring your race team
4757808 never promise wins promise performance and the ability to market their company and product on and off the track in a professional manner if you promise wins and dont deliver you will lose the sponsorship in the long run being able to represent a company and its products professionally will get you more results and keep sponsors coming back year after year
4757809 when meeting with a potential sponsor dress professionally and present a professional atmosphere
4757810 this doesnt mean you have to dress in suit and tie although that may be the appropriate dress when meeting with certain potential sponsors but jeans and a t shirt are a definite no no
4757811 make sure you do a little research on the company you plan on approaching there are several ways to find out what type of products and services the potential sponsor provides and it will also tell you how your race team can help market that product or service
4757812 dont forget to market not only your car but your trailer car hauler it is a rolling billboard and gets as much if not more attention on the way to the track each week
4757813 start early in your sponsorship search and be persistent and remember to have plenty of options for a potential sponsor to choose from in your proposal
4757814 sometimes it is easier to get ten smaller sponsors than one big sponsor if you need 250 a week to race ten sponsors at 25 a week is easier to get than one sponsor at 250 per week
4757815 a small business owner can reach in his pocket for 25 and not have to explain it to the wife so remember sometimes smaller is better and dont expect someone to spend 10 000 a year with you on a lower division car and most important visit and talk with your sponsors on a regular basis make them feel like part of the team
4757816 a simple phone call each week or a newsletter every month makes that sponsor feel that they are important to the race team
4757817 too many race teams get a good sponsor put the sponsors name on the car and tow rig take the sponsors check and never talk with them again thats the last time theyll have that company as a sponsor
4757818 the drivers and race teams have to realize that in todays world you have to market market market and market some more i know its an added cost to the team but they have to either have someone on their team that knows marketing and public relations or hire someone to do it it is so vitally important in todays business world
4757819 again it comes down to sacrificing the resources and time to do the marketing and pr the right way get involved with every appearance the team can possibly make whether it is for their sponsor functions or just displaying the car in a parade taking it to a school scout meetings actually anything where there is exposure
4757820 sure thing hes got a point alright the strange weather reports from around the world are just starting to make themselves heard there will be much more of the same on a later stage early warning signs include heat waves and periods of unusually warm weather ocean warming sea level rise and coastal flooding glaciers melting spreading disease earlier spring arrival plant and animal range shifts and population changes coral reef bleaching downpours heavy snowfalls and flooding droughts and fires its definitely not cool and casting a blind eye at these most worrisome signs do not make them go away either
4757821 not much and that is the thing it is not primarily a question of what you choose to do its more a question of what you choose to stop doing you could start by putting an end to your excess fossil fuels use its not so difficult really and it would be a very wise response to the information that the coal the gas and the oil are the substances that are in fact warming this planet and thus making climate systems go weird slowing down on fossil fuels consumption should come as the first and the best solution to global warming but here we are looking at a species of fossil fuel addicts and we can safely say it proves difficult for whole societies of people to kick the habit
4757822 that they cant just continue doing what amounts to plain stupid behaviour just continue doing what ought not to be done and continue doing so until people start dying from climate change in big numbers
4757823 it may seem as if a growing number of people are ready to accept the facts of global warming and world wide climate change so things are indeed happening
4757824 no theyre not mad its only that fossil fuels are the cheapest of all sources of energy in existence
4757825 why not i mean whats good for the planet is good for humanity and whats good for humanity should be good for the government too and if certain lines of work are easily found to be destructive to the environment you know what i mean
4757826 okay fine but you see im not people all i am doing is think about what might come as good news to the ecosystems of this planet as for how people think im not sure are they at all thinking i mean how can they possibly look at environmental destruction due to the consumption of coal for example and then conclude that is a matter of great importance
4757827 irrational seems to be the key word to all enhancement of understanding of what appears to be happening around here more than 16 000 species are presently listed as at risk of extinction and human activity threatens 99 percent of them its irrational isnt it
4757828 now i wonder what good would be the end result if people in emissions prone industries were paid for taking a long vacation while a whole species at rest woke up to the fact that what theyre about to commit here is a crime against nature and all for what well for nothing you know what i mean
4757829 and that my dear friend makes me happy isnt it perfectly clear by now that humanity is in need of
4757830 questions like these will become a part of open discussions at international conferences in governing bodies and spoken of by those in the mass media

4757894 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias

4757899 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can engage the work to achieve national healing and reconciliation

4757914 i presented myself to the members of the 19th and was totally honest with them these are people who are very involved with delaware politics and included two members of our legislature i look at this as a confirmation of my campaign and a validation of why i think change is necessary in this very important office
4757915 i know i have an almost impossible task ahead of me but i sincerely believe a change is needed i sincerely believe ncco citizens are being unrepresented by the incumbent and i am very happy that the 19th chose to revoke its earlier endorsement of paul

4757919 we want to continue to recognize the right to develop land and renew older areas because it produces jobs and new housing but if we must develop we must do it right you cannot undo bad land use decisions once the construction has been finished
4757920 we have just turned off the pilot lights on our two gas fireplaces they burn between 12 to 15 of gas per month
4757921 pilot lights burn around 8 to 12 a month in natural gas yep the thumb sized little flame you see in fire places or a furnace i measured my own the reep home inspector said that they use a 10 to 12 per month newer appliances eg gas water heaters meet a new efficiency rules and use less gas but there is a certain minimum size to keep the thing from snuffing out electric ignition is a great way to save gas i know people who are paranoid about pilot lights because they think that if they turn them off spiders will plug up the holes its funny but this doesnt seem to happen with furnaces mind you the furnace is sealed a lot better than a fire place

4757930 how do i create teams that promote individual and collective performance
4757931 the hospitality industry is just beginning to unleash the power of online commerce and travelclick has demonstrated its ability and commitment to bringing an individualized experience to its customers and online shoppers alike
4757932 the company has unique capabilities to deliver media and analytical solutions individualized to hoteliers radically transforming their marketing efforts and associated profitability
4757933 from the customer side i have seen the true value of what travelclick can do for hotels delivering 33 percent revenue growth so far this year for its customers
4757934 the company has a distinct role in the industry managing the intersection of interactive media and online technology so that hotels can effectively compete in travel 2 0 and beyond travelclick specializes in simplifying the complex creating practical personalized solutions that empower hotels to achieve more bookings and more revenue
4757935 these highly talented individuals bring a wealth of media and technology knowledge to the company as well as embrace the customer vision of our expanding travelclick team
4757936 their experience and seasoned industry insights will help drive the next stages of rapid growth of our business and the business of our customers worldwide

4757941 for a very long time its been clear that there was a security vacuum in the south caucasus
4757942 its a lesson for ukraine ukraine is the largest post soviet country after russia and one that shares a long border with the european union it cant be left in a similar vacuum
4757943 what we can see in this overreaction is that there is a risk for ukraine and of course ukraine has a frozen conflict on its own border
4757944 we want to avoid a security vacuum that will be prone to a defrosting of such a frozen conflict
4757945 european leaders must now realize that the south ossetia conflict has opened such a vacuum throughout the entire area that moscow sometimes calls its near abroad we welcome the eus effort led by france and supported by germany and others to be more visible as an actor in the region
4757946 the government of ukraine adopted a clear position the centerpiece of which was the recognition and support of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
4757947 the president of ukraine took the lead in voicing the official ukrainian position and we felt no need to repeat it those accusations against the prime minister are misplaced
4757948 weve had to cancel six so far this year with another five weeks of the season to go
4757949 its still possible to go ahead with performances in light rain but the combination of incessant rain being blown in from the atlantic on gale force winds has made it very difficult and really unusual this year
4757950 weve obviously got a good idea of what the weathers going to be but conditions can change so quickly particularly here right on the coast near lands end so we wait as long as possible
4757951 its very tough for the performers too if weve got to cancel because theyve spent a long time preparing and they want to get on with the show but in the end its all down to health and safety

4757967 this king loves jews therefore he asked the jews living in bahrain to request jews living in israel to return there are two reasons for it one is lip service or to emphasize his love to the jews there
4757968 i want to tell you there are very few jews in bahrain they all work as traders they are obligated to the king and in the parliament this wise king chose from every group representatives in the parliament even the jews who are a small minority
4757969 the jews felt hostility they were victims of looting including my house in bahrain the majority are shia muslims which were behind most of the looting thats when i decided to come to israel
4757970 they refused they have a lot of money businesses i gave up
4757971 but i think that the people of the parliament dont like the idea that a jew is there and see her as a spy the king who loves the jews promoted her to be an ambassador
4757972 bahrain has reached out for hundreds of years we have got at least 30 churches in a very small country and mosques next to churches and synagogues next to churches they are all living there and i think this is the real arab neighborhood

4757992 we hold dear the firm view that robert mugabe and mswati iii are not legitimate leaders of their various countries
4757993 they cannot claim any amount of legitimacy to rule their countries for they have not been democratically elected by the peoples of their countries
4757994 therefore as representatives of civil society we condemn the behaviour of these two leaders and take it upon ourselves to expose them and their unacceptable behaviour before the eyes of the world

4758019 each condition of metabolic syndrome phenomenon high blood pressure type 2 diabetes and obesity independently raises the risk for erectile dysfunction just on their own
4758020 and so when all are present in combination as part of this syndrome you have a situation where you dont even need to be as diabetic or hypertensive as you might otherwise have to be to experience erectile dysfunction and that fact has been raising concern among clinicians
4758021 so we followed up on case reports and anecdotal evidence that statins being used to lower cholesterol over a six to eight week period among patients with metabolic syndrome seemed to also quickly improve erections even before cholesterol levels go down
4758022 and in an animal model we found this to be the case
4758023 statins are used by everyone under the sun and as far as i know theres been no hard evidence that it can be used to treat erectile dysfunction
4758024 on the other hand it may be that it could prevent or modify some of the other risk factors for erectile dysfunction
4758025 this is because we do know that an increase in rho kinase leads to heightened tone of the corpus smooth muscle which is one of the causes of erectile dysfunction
4758026 so while i wouldnt go too far with this and i would probably not see statins becoming a primary treatment for erectile dysfunction if these findings turn out to be true then there could perhaps be an additional good use for statins

4758067 while it is true that here we are concerned with financial dependency and not emotional dependence the whole relationship between the appellant and the deceased must be examined

4758069 surely a mothers services to a young child satisfy the test the child could not survive without the provision of those services he or she needs them to suggest that in a money sense they are valueless is simply wrong
4758070 the same considerations apply to a step child or his or her step mother when the child lives with the step mother and is looked after by her i appreciate that a different view has been taken by others as for example by powell j in dunn v public trustee powell j 1 june 1989 unreported but i would respectfully disagree with that view in my opinion the plaintiff was partly dependent upon the deceased certainly for many years of her childhood and probably until her marriage although no doubt her dependence diminished in the latter years of this period

4758089 ini bukan gothak gathuk mathuk tetapi saya cenderung memastikan ke depan nantinya bakal muncul tunas tunas bangsa dan memperlihatkan eksitensinya tunas tunas bangsa itu nantinya akan mampu membuat kuncara dan membawa perubahan zaman baru bagi indonesia
4758090 kedepan nanti tokoh atau pemimpin yang hanya mengandalkan simbol harumnya bunga sudah tidak laku lagi yang dibutuhkan adalah mereka yang punya simbol daun seperti mahalnya anthurium yang bermakna bisa menghidupi seluruh bangsa sampai ke akar akarnya menyentuh kehidupan wong cilik
4758091 disadari atau tidak soal ketahanan spiritual ini sering terlupakan dalam rangka mengentaskan berbagai permasalahan bangsa dan negara
4758092 akibat gabungan kedua kekuatan itu menjadikan pemimpin bisa langgeng berkuasa
4758093 sosok satria piningit akan muncul bila negara dalam situasi chaos dan rakyat secara serentak melakukan doa doa agar diturunkan sosok penyelamat
4758094 tempat tempat itu merupakan pusat kekuatan gaib yang menjadi cikal bakal kemakmuran tanah jawa dan nusantara
4758095 karena kita telah lama melupakan sejarah laluhur gaib dengan selamatan agung diharapkan berbagai permasalahan bangsa dan negara segera bisa ditepiskan
4758096 membaca perjalanan spiritual pak harto memang kelewat panjang namun dari laku spiritual yang digeluti menjadikan dirinya sebagai satria linuwih baik dari sisi jasmani maupun rohani
4758097 intinya perjalanan soeharto kelewat panjang hidupnya tak terlepas dari pernik pernik spiritual
4758098 semasa hidup ayah saya memang amat kental dan mengerti tentang kehidupan soeharto termasuk pernik pernik spiritual yang melingkupi kehidupan pak harto
4758099 menurut ayah saya pak hart punya tiga keris ampuh dan pusaka itu didapatkan sendiri saat menjalani ritual bisa jadi setelah pak harto wafat ketiga keris itu akan muksa sendiri toh jika tidak muksa harus dilarung sebab jika tidak akan menimbulkan aura jelek bagi keluarga yang ditinggalkannya
4758100 terkait dengan keteguhan pak harto dalam memegang rahasia ilmunya saya meragukan jika da orang lain bisa mengatakan soal ilmu yang dikuasai pak harto
4758101 meski keterkaitan sakitnya pak harto dengan peristiwa alam sulit dibuktikan tetapi dari sisi spiritual setidaknya mengarah ke hal itu

4758103 mr langdon has been officially missing since 4th august and we believe that where he has been what he has been doing and who he has been with are of extreme importance to our inquiries
4758104 by naming him now we hope that anyone who knew him or just recognised him will be able to help us fill in the gaps as to what has happened to him during the 10 days prior to his body being found

4758110 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
4758111 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
4758112 its not how young you are its how old you arent
4758113 it is true that there has been contact but i do know that there is no offer
4758114 we would be happy to negotiate with west ham or other clubs if it is good both for him and the club
4758115 if an offer comes that means sergio can continue to evolve and in turn compensate zaragoza with good money itll be studied
4758116 oh i didnt expect you to be so quiet and polite
4758117 hey mom i know we already went out to get some back to school clothes but i just realised that i need some more shirts

4758122 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4758123 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4758124 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf
4758125 the vermont college writers community is so caring and the faculty amazing you cant help but dig in
4758126 we will have to improve if we want to repeat the success we had last season
4758127 the more we win the more other people want to knock us off our perch
4758128 but when you look at barcelona they have gone out and signed some really good players real madrid look good and inter milan will be strong under jose mourinho
4758129 they have great experienced players who are obviously not happy with us winning the league two years in a row
4758130 they have signed some new players as well and got a new manager so they will make it tough for us while i think liverpool will close the gap this season as well
4758131 it will be interesting to see how arsenal go on given the players they have lost
4758132 any other team would struggle given the players they seem to lose on a regular basis but somehow they seem to stay up there
4758133 this could be a tough season for them but somehow arsene wenger always seems to do the business with his players
4758134 the beauty of playing for a club like this is that the players want to improve
4758135 you see paul scholes and ryan giggs leading the way doing extra in the weights room and our training games are sometimes a better standard than premier league games
4758136 you soon find out a draw is a bad result at this club in fact there have even been times when we have won and said afterwards our performance probably was not good enough
4758137 but that pressure to perform also means if we play to our potential we will pretty much beat everyone
4758138 that is what we need to focus on because if we achieve that on a regular basis we have a very good chance of being champions again

4758144 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4758145 it really is a tremendous honour to sign for a club of celtics stature
4758146 i am really looking forward to playing for a team that has such an incredible history and well known and passionate supporters
4758147 the club has enjoyed great success in recent years winning titles and cups in scotland and doing well in the champions league
4758148 also dann bis hmm morgen komm ich nicht mittwoch nur kurz um was abzugeben donnerstag sowieso nicht also dann bis freitag

4758152 this represents the first demonstration that kidney injury in membranous nephropathy can regress after selective depletion of b cells thus the present data provide a strong rationale for using rituximab to treat patients with membranous nephropathy
4758153 whether this may apply to other similar kidney conditions and may translate into long term protection from renal function loss and the potentially life threatening complications remains to be established
4758154 what a relief the somali found dead next to a jar of cyanide in denver right before
4758155 we know that testosterone makes males more susceptible to disease we wanted to find out if it impacts their behavior as well and how that increases their ability to transmit disease
4758156 our plan was to raise the testosterone levels in wild mice and measure the disease risk they posed to the population
4758157 these findings suggest that even if some individuals in a population have high levels of testosterone they can impact the behavior of those around and drive the transmission of diseases transmitted by close contact such as the respiratory pathogen bordetella grear said
4758158 let anyone who is thirsty come to me and let the one who believes
4758159 the last player we will want to sell is james milner and i am talking about the owner mike ashley and myself im sure he will not be leaving st james park
4758160 hopefully this season we can push on again we know the fans are excited about this season and so are we
4758161 everyone just wanted the man city game to be the day after the uefa cup game because we want to get the season off to a winning start
4758162 if you look at what ive done since the gaffer came to the club hes been an inspiration to me hopefully i can produce for him every week thats my aim
4758163 i definitely prefer being in a unified changing room than with individuals who are thinking about their own thing and have their own agenda all the time
4758164 some people think we have no incentive thats why we dont save
4758165 savings are significantly lower for people who estimate higher for a future time frame
4758166 they think they can actually save more in the future
4758167 that could explain why most of us dont save enough
4758168 studies in the literature show that when people reflect on how they spend money money spent on experiences tends to leave a stronger feeling of being happy than money spent on objects
4758169 the first pattern we noticed was an annual cycle that appeared to be related to seasonal interests and events in search patterns
4758170 search volumes for words like diet and exercise tended to increase sharply at certain times of the year like right around new years for example
4758171 initially the goal of this study was to just look at the google trends service itself and report on its potential as a research tool
4758172 however the appearance of patterns and relationships in the terms used to look at this service now has us asking many more questions and considering how google trends might best help us to answer them as well
4758173 we know that obesity per se is a risk factor for developing heart disease
4758174 but once you develop it is obesity more detrimental than not being overweight there have been different studies with results going both ways
4758175 with low dose statin therapy obesity was detrimental with more blockage what was unexpected was that with high doses of the statin obesity did not have much of an effect at all
4758176 they lower inflammation and people who are obese have greater inflammation there is a lot of evidence that inflammation in general is not good since a person who is obese has more of that going on statins tend to protect
4758177 what we can say is that if you have heart disease particularly if you had bypass surgery you should be on a good dose of a statin
4758178 if you are overweight or obese you really should take your statin and be aggressive about it
4758179 you get much more benefit than for someone who is thinner
4758180 demonstrated the strongest association with cardiovascular disease and best model fit
4758181 cardiovascular disease risk increased linearly and significantly with higher levels of all indexes
4758182 maybe this will be another motivator to either keep people active or motivate them to become active if theyre not
4758183 this is a questionable concept since we do not know the strength of the direction or association between physical health and mental function
4758184 here is when we ask which comes first the egg or the chicken
4758185 by being able to detect the fact that theyre on the path to dementia i think well be able in the future to target better therapies that might prevent the onset of dementia or potentially to prepare the ground for the person in the family to face the disease
4758186 so if you can improve that element of the way our bodies work which is what physical fitness does youre going to be also protecting the brain from cognitive decline
4758187 and conversely if you can maintain your brain function by exercising it you may also be improving your ability to stay physically active
4758188 whats known is that people who exercise are less likely to get dementia but people who exercise might be different in other ways
4758189 pharmacotherapy with salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate or the components reduces the rate of decline on lung function in patients with moderate to severe copd thus slowing disease progression
4758190 to date smoking cessation is the only intervention that has conclusively been shown to alter the rate of decline in lung function
4758191 although treatment did not abolish the accelerated decline in lung function that occurs with copd it did ameliorate it substantially
4758192 unexpressed concerns are challenging because they can lead to different expectations and understanding of the problems patients are concerned about and treatment recommendations that are poorly tailored to patient needs
4758193 physicians will have little chance to correct or modify them unfortunately unexpressed concerns may contribute to breakdowns in communication which are frustrating for both physicians and patients
4758194 knowing that older adults frequently dont voice all their concerns should help surgeons create opportunities for patients who are reluctant to bring them up
4758195 competitors dressed in red are awarded more points than competitors dressed in blue even when their performance is identical
4758196 we propose that the perception of colors triggers a psychological effect in referees
4758197 referees are responsible for the advantage conveyed to athletes who wear red
4758198 one can speculate that the red clothed players are associated not only with more dominance but also with more aggressiveness and in ambiguous foul decisions this could be a disadvantage
4758199 the people in blue are seeing red and theyre doing worse its not that wearing red leads to better performance
4758200 ive been a pastor and professor and you should do it this way
4758201 i want to support and follow the leaders in any way i can
4758202 the bill will not flood our cities with immigrants it will not upset the ethnic mix of our society it will not relax the standards of admission it will not cause american workers to lose their jobs
4758203 i just had to kind of sit around it took a little time
4758204 you dont want to go out there and take it for granted
4758205 thats when you mess up like when the false start comes ive never false started in my life but it could have been that one time then im out in the first round and there go my chances
4758206 my coach wanted me to work on the blast at the beginning to get a feel for the track and if i felt good maintain it and if i cant shut it down
4758207 i was very pleased with the time because i havent been able to run races
4758208 they took the music from the dark knight but none of the quality
4758209 but mom they wont play with each other and it gets exhausting if i have to keep changing who i am playing with
4758210 were at the low level right now and its going to take time
4758211 if that means trying to get it right with six seven or eight sports i would rather do that than try to go too wide
4758212 beijing is an indicator of what the gap is between us and our competitors
4758213 we do need to take a look at strategic investments in some of those sports where we could put in 300 000 or 400 000 and get some results
4758214 australia did it all the time in archery for example but we have to have the right information
4758215 if we dont have the expertise in canada then we need to go overseas and get them there but we have to be careful that we dont say were going to pay a coach a huge salary and then not give him the tools to do the job
4758216 ive come from a system where often in the early days so many services were pushed on sport they didnt know which ones were the important ones
4758217 i do believe we shouldnt be here just to participate
4758218 ive never believed in just making the national team and being happy and satisfied with that
4758219 if our athletes are here there should be a realistic chance to get to the podium
4758220 its never time to modify the medal projection until the gun goes at the end of the games
4758221 were not even halfway into the games right now and were a second half team
4758222 theres our bubble as we call it and we try to stay in that as much as we can
4758223 we dont read comments we dont read forums we dont read all the websites nothing like that
4758224 you dont want to get brought down by negativity we all want to be that one to win the first medal because thats pretty awesome but were all doing the best we can

4758233 security people are often the black and white kind of people that i cant stand i think the openbsd crowd is a bunch of masturbating monkeys in that they make such a big deal about concentrating on security to the point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them
4758234 as far as i am concerned openbsd is the project with the most demonstrated interest in fixing all bugs found no matter how trivial and to systematically examine all source code for instances of bugs encountered i believe that this is the bedrock principle of pursuing security software that just works rather than software with rube goldberg constructs of knobs and security theatre scenery
4758235 too often so called security is split into two camps one that believes in nondisclosure of problems by hiding knowledge until a bug is fixed and one that revels in exposing vendor security holes because they see that as just another proof that the vendors are corrupt and crap which admittedly mostly are torvalds states

4758267 i am the last born of a big family and also a twin my parents were in the navy so we traveled around a bit and then decided to settle in georgia no i am not a peach per se but

4758270 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4758271 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4758272 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4758273 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4758274 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4758275 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4758276 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4758277 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4758278 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4758279 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4758280 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4758281 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4758282 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4758283 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4758284 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4758285 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4758286 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4758287 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4758288 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4758289 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4758290 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4758291 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4758292 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4758293 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4758294 so our precaution at this point is to shut down the highway

4758309 there is a job to be done and it is a good job because it pays it doesnt really matter what my education was at home the opportunity is here and you take it and you do it and it will work out
4758310 with many immigrants there is this sense that they made this hard choice to leave their homelands and they are going to make it under any cost
4758311 i think theres a tendency to see the positive even under the most dire circumstances because so much is at stake theyve left family family members are counting on them and they want to make this work
4758312 if the player is a marginal player the coach and g m are going to have a tough time with him but if hes a great player dont you think theyre in love with him
4758313 where i strongly differ from jim gilmores position is that somehow that is the silver bullet that is going to solve all the nations energy problems
4758314 we may sell replica watches but we sell quality and affordable watches

4758338 this water was at one time totally pristine and i hate to see anybody throw things sewage toilet paper anything thats gonna kill the fish
4758339 it is true that there has been contact but i do know that there is no offer
4758340 we would be happy to negotiate with west ham or other clubs if it is good both for him and the club
4758341 if an offer comes that means sergio can continue to evolve and in turn compensate zaragoza with good money itll be studied
4758342 it really is a tremendous honour to sign for a club of celtics stature
4758343 i am really looking forward to playing for a team that has such an incredible history and well known and passionate supporters
4758344 the club has enjoyed great success in recent years winning titles and cups in scotland and doing well in the champions league
4758345 if i am in a race then i want to win it it is never great fun to be fifth or sixth even third place doesnt feel so great to me anymore i only want to win
4758346 whoever thinks i am content or tired is completely wrong if we do not get both championship titles at the end of the season then we will be disappointed

4758350 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
4758351 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation

4758353 we knew the other crews had a lot better finish than we did
4758354 the fact that 10 member unions have signalled their intention to tender for the 2015 and 2019 tournaments reflects the growing global prestige of the rugby world cup

4758356 so one of the co owners is a republican dont pay him any mind afterall hes already got your money
4758357 stating the political preference of one of the co owners is not disparaging as far as my comment i used no inappropriate language and was making a lighthearted joke of the situation its odd to me that manhunt would censor something like this i realize this is a private site and that freedom of speech is limited but its striking nonetheless thanks so much

4758361 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
4758362 and it was a very important and serious thing that involved national interests and an order from a state leader from the politburo
4758363 it was about presenting the nations music and cultural image especially because it was as the national flag entered the birds nest
4758364 the girl shown on television had to have the most perfect voice and be perfect looking it was fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi
4758365 i have an obligation to make this explanation to the chinese audience
4758366 clever child with indeed a beautiful voice and painting and singing talents
4758367 she is a good child kind hearted cute friendly and low profile with a very calm heart she loves performing peking opera and has participated in shows on international volunteers day
4758368 its harmful to both girls and it is discomforting to know that a girl was instructed to mime while the other had no chance to show her face due to an allegedly unattractive appearance
4758369 why do we have to compromise honesty for these so called national interests
4758370 we received two orders in a row yesterday morning urging us to delete the article immediately and not to allow any publicity on this issue
4758371 wed been through several inspections theyre all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were several spectators from various divisions especially leaders from the politburo who gave the opinion it must change

4758374 either the view or the country dont match the affiliation of the reporter then that country has had it at least in the hysterical english language press that standard bearer of self righteous morality and sole arbiter of universal taste
4758375 the page was removed by china com cn however there was a baidu cached page no mention of crooked teeth and chubby fat face
4758376 either the view or the country dont match the affiliation of the reporter then that country has had it at least in the hysterical english language press that standard bearer of self righteous morality and sole arbiter of universal taste
4758377 that papers are biased useless as far as most things are concerned but not sourav
4758378 mr chen disclosed in interviews that producers had pulled peiyi a seven year old beijing girl with a
4758379 we didnt expect miaoke to become so popular overnight and it would be a big embarrassment if miaoke was shaped into a singing star but later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
4758380 this is a smarter way of letting the public know something that it will know sooner or later but i dont think this thing was a big thing to start with
4758381 embarrassed that their beautiful dream of the patriotic song had burst
4758382 there were a number of candidates to sing the song and the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
4758383 you have to make sure the performance and the song are at the highest level it is a casting or a technical decision by the producer
4758384 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
4758385 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing that hes going to stay on the bench
4758386 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great thats what it is in sport and in life
4758387 we were very pleased with its outcome of one of the most complicated events to organise in the world
4758388 later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
4758389 they made us sign and chop a document saying we would not allow black people in during the olympics
4758390 but no one is willing to say so because well all get deported and have our business shut
4758391 we simply cant let them in during the olympics its what i was told
4758392 its the restrictions on blacks definitely happening it will all happen in 24 hours
4758393 they local police call meetings and everyone has to go or else if you dont go theyll come back and shut you down
4758394 black guys can come in and drink as long as they have valid visas
4758395 but we have been told to watch out for black guys acting suspiciously such as constantly talking on their mobile phones the aim is to crack down on drug dealing
4758396 if this is policy then it is a very bad policy more so for a country holding an olympics
4758397 uniformed public security bureau officers came into the bar recently and told me not to serve black people or mongolians
4758398 i understand that the government is trying to stop certain illegal activities but i dont think blanket discrimination is going about it the right way
4758399 chinese people are prejudiced but i would have hoped that the government would set a better example as it debuts on the world stage
4758400 the officials told me to inform my customers that they must at all times carry their passports or id cards
4758401 security is important but beijing is becoming a fortress and thats not attractive
4758402 the local police told us to get rid of the tables because theyre scared that if too many foreigners congregate outside there could be trouble
4758403 the whole music scene is angry and bewildered it is impossible to understand how keeping tourists from seeing an open culturally vibrant and diverse beijing is possibly a good thing for anyone
4758404 it appears the local government is trying to control every aspect of the experience that foreigners get when they come here
4758405 everything is aimed at creating stability but they dont understand that is precisely the unfounded prejudice that foreigners have of chinese society that it is a highly controlled and not a very cultural place it seems completely self defeating
4758406 our party has a been no majority party for a long time the democratic party is made up of lots of different people and were all minorities in our party
4758407 thats the way its been for a long long time we are the party of opportunity so the demographic trends favor the democrats because we are an inclusive and accepting party
4758408 a pretty monolithic party they all behave the same they all look the same its pretty much a white christian party
4758409 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them
4758410 im just trying to make good contact there and i crushed the ball
4758411 the first pitch was a fastball then im watching his release on the next pitch and the fastball comes again and i got all of it
4758412 i like the way these kids get after it for nine innings
4758413 im happy for the team this has been a difficult place for us
4758414 ive been rushing a little too much and ive been working with the pitching coach on correcting some things in my approach
4758415 we had a chance to add on a run but we didnt
4758416 on the days allocated for the exterior heavy original treatment the weather was less than cooperative the skies opened up in a heavy hail storm which threatened to destroy our camera gear but this proved to be a blessing in disguise as it ripped us from the remote locations originally supposed and thrust us into the heart of a bustling detroit michigan where tim was truly showcased as a distinct voice amongst the faceless masses and sprawling metropolitan landscapes
4758417 anywhere else in the world it would be called compost
4758418 nunca mais fa a isso nunca mais fa a isso voc pode ferir algu m desse jeito voc ficou maluca
4758419 president medvedev informed members of the security council of the russian federation that he had signed the document on principles

4758423 i have to be sure im going to win i wouldnt want to go out like bradley mcgee did and not qualify for the final
4758424 i would welcome participating in a paternity test be happy to participate in one happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
4758425 a good thing for them a bad thing for us
4758426 is it possible for us to witness a world without america and zionism
4758427 they even tried to melt some plastic on the boys private parts
4758428 the police also took out a parang dagger and a pistol to threaten the boy
4758429 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4758430 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4758431 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4758432 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4758433 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4758434 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4758435 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4758450 i dont have any money but i want to play the game so i will pirate it
4758451 saying that something is normal isnt endorsing it in an ideal world i guess everyone would describe 100 of what they are selling point out all the bad reviews as well as the good ones and explain all the flaws it has to everyone about to buy it but i cant imagine that working out very well
4758452 were not going to get caught in the trap of trying to provide a social experience
4758453 we risk drawing people for the wrong reasons and thats not our core competency
4758454 its more about developing long lasting relationships with the music and these people its not so much about access to cheap tickets
4758455 we want to encourage the next generation of community leaders to be involved with the arts
4758456 its a mistake to get too hung up on age
4758457 if the average age of our audience was 30 we wouldnt be raising 2 5 million a year from gifts wed be out of business if that was the case
4758458 there is a distinction between creating access for everyone versus creating access for a group of people who want to have that network and value that education and volunteerism
4758459 you dont have to be 65 and have dumped a lot of dollars to have an impact on an organization
4758460 betting whether or not youll get a lot of money out of these people later on in life is like trying to project what the economic forecast is going to be in 40 50 years
4758461 the core large donors the people who give the really high seven eight figures are the people who will always be the target donors for orchestras and those people arent poor in their 20s typically
4758462 we had a younger couple in front of me and they were kissing in between the pieces weve found the formula and im very optimistic
4758463 the scam points out the need for kansans to be wary and diligent in reporting any fraudulent insurance activity
4758464 theres still plenty of business out there just not as much as before
4758465 its very stressful day in and day out im not getting rich by any means but i am cultivating relationships
4758466 if we dont create the knowledge based industries and the diversity of opportunities yes they are going to leave

4758469 roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4758470 cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
4758471 as a mayor of a small town and as a lifetime democrat i can attest to the fact that gov
4758472 it truly saddens me to hear national and state democratic party leaders trying to discredit him his sincere service and early successes to our great state demonstrates one should lead by their actions and not their words gov jindal is governor of all of louisiana
4758473 the good news is that at this time theyre not planning on
4758474 gm is going to have to make strategic decisions on what kind of products to offer
4758475 at a few shows ive seen him look at songs written on signs and take requests that way
4758476 i went up and down the line to see who had the closest seats
4758477 then i picked two pretty girls to have the best chance hed notice the girls and the sign im a girl i know how it works
4758478 oh god when i heard the river i just thought wow this guy knows about life
4758479 i have not and will not do anything illegal for 12 years i have worked hard to be fair and honest in this office and there is no way that i would throw that away in the last few months of my tenure
4758480 may be applicable but otherwise it is possibly a question for the florida ethics commission
4758481 use his or her official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with an election or a nomination of office or coercing or influencing another persons vote or affecting the result thereof
4758482 primarily because she was using county assets in her campaign
4758483 drove to the forum in the mobile county vehicle that was assigned to her and brought with her volumes of forms that had been downloaded from the revenue commissioners web site these forms had been reproduced and stapled by a revenue commission employee while being paid overtime by mobile county
4758484 ms woods campaign business card was stapled to the front page of the booklets
4758485 im looking forward to going back home full time to broward county
4758486 forty years in political life and i turn 66 in a few days im looking forward to going back to what i love and thats practicing law
4758487 he is a role model for all of us and he will be missed
4758488 it was an opportunity not only for marissa but for others also to show how this government has changed how we do business in tallahassee
4758489 that story was a topic for several weeks but it did not set the department back
4758490 are fair to the retirees and to the taxpayers of the city
4758491 they tried to change the methodology and it didnt work in their favor because of the uproar of the retirees and the overwhelming increases the retirees couldnt afford
4758492 retirees put them on notice they had to go back to the way that they normally do business
4758493 this is basically implementing whats been in place all along
4758494 i dont have the data to see if its a well taken decision or not
4758495 the bottom line is we dont have the information to judge and we havent had direct communication from the administration as to their rationale
4758496 more employees wanted the 3 percent cost of living raise than ones that wanted the 75 percent for the unused sick leave
4758497 unused sick leave is not earned leave unlike unused vacation
4758498 employees earn the right to take vacation time off and be paid for sick leave employees earn the right to be paid if they are unable to work for medical reasons but there is not an earned interest in that if medical conditions do not require the use of the leave
4758499 we should look at whether there is any possibility of revisiting the space shuttle extension even for short period of time while we are in the middle of this political and diplomatic and military nightmare
4758500 it is difficult to engage in a nation when you have a sizable amount of disagreements
4758501 instability and clear desire to wage war on democracies illustrates the need to increase nasas funding and close the gap
4758502 americas space program is best served by the talents of heroes at home not cosmonauts 5 000 miles away
4758503 could threaten our ability to make the maximum possible use
4758504 we are hopeful we can continue cooperation with the russians
4758505 but a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future
4758506 were optimistic things will work out in the long run
4758507 their failure to do so has put us in this regrettable situation
4758508 barring a major rupture in the u s russian relationship across the board
4758509 i do not see why space cooperation cannot be maintained
4758510 the legislature will have to raise taxes in excess of the property tax cut
4758511 i just had to kind of sit around it took a little time
4758512 you dont want to go out there and take it for granted
4758513 thats when you mess up like when the false start comes ive never false started in my life but it could have been that one time then im out in the first round and there go my chances
4758514 my coach wanted me to work on the blast at the beginning to get a feel for the track and if i felt good maintain it and if i cant shut it down
4758515 i was very pleased with the time because i havent been able to run races
4758516 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white uh excuse me in the laughs republican party

4758518 president medvedev informed members of the security council of the russian federation that he had signed the document on principles
4758519 i think the chemistry is good between all the linebackers we have
4758520 mr barrymore acts with such imagination and zest that he never fails to keep the picture thoroughly alive
4758521 and his totally assured style is reflected in the quick naturalistic dialogue quirky black humour and the ability to turn potentially risible set pieces like hustons first confrontation with a yard full of riotous cons into electrifying suspense
4758522 and hawks toughest statement on the necessity of accepting responsibility for others or forfeiting ones self respect the sum total of morality for hawks and the perfect bridge from the free and open world of only angels have wings to the claustrophobic one of rio bravo
4758523 a funny fast paced and offbeat story enlivened by animated performances from the two leads
4758524 its seminal importance in the early gangster movie cycle is outweighed only by its still exhilarating brilliance
4758525 one of the best of hawks early dramas and remarkable for its detailed portrait of a small fishing community
4758526 neatly reversing the usual comic model where marriage only ever signals the end
4758527 this is a classic demonstration of hawks unsentimental optimism and a comedy on frustration and sex roles that is romantic subversive and extremely funny all at the same time
4758528 the evidence onscreen is the proof of mr hawks genius
4758529 you only have to watch monkey business to know that is a brilliant film
4758530 the majestic sweep of rivers mountains passes and woods of grand teton national park is a sight to behold and a tribute to photography
4758531 offers one of the most civilized movie going experiences in the city
4758532 you know how to whistle dont you steve you just put your lips together and blow
4758533 benefits from the swift hawks pacing and the charm of its two leads
4758534 tiger shark was remade several times unofficially by warners but this remains the definitive version with its hard edged almost documentary style and monumental performances
4758535 in only angels have wings howard hawks had a story to tell and he has done it inspiringly well
4758536 its unusual to find yourself laughing in a movie not because something is funny but because its so wickedly clever
4758537 if one does not love the films of howard hawks one cannot love cinema
4758538 mr barrymore acts with such imagination and zest that he never fails to keep the picture thoroughly alive
4758539 and his totally assured style is reflected in the quick naturalistic dialogue quirky black humour and the ability to turn potentially risible set pieces like hustons first confrontation with a yard full of riotous cons into electrifying suspense
4758540 and hawks toughest statement on the necessity of accepting responsibility for others or forfeiting ones self respect the sum total of morality for hawks and the perfect bridge from the free and open world of only angels have wings to the claustrophobic one of rio bravo
4758541 a funny fast paced and offbeat story enlivened by animated performances from the two leads
4758542 its seminal importance in the early gangster movie cycle is outweighed only by its still exhilarating brilliance
4758543 one of the best of hawks early dramas and remarkable for its detailed portrait of a small fishing community
4758544 neatly reversing the usual comic model where marriage only ever signals the end
4758545 this is a classic demonstration of hawks unsentimental optimism and a comedy on frustration and sex roles that is romantic subversive and extremely funny all at the same time
4758546 the evidence onscreen is the proof of mr hawks genius
4758547 you only have to watch monkey business to know that is a brilliant film
4758548 the majestic sweep of rivers mountains passes and woods of grand teton national park is a sight to behold and a tribute to photography

4758550 you know how to whistle dont you steve you just put your lips together and blow
4758551 benefits from the swift hawks pacing and the charm of its two leads
4758552 tiger shark was remade several times unofficially by warners but this remains the definitive version with its hard edged almost documentary style and monumental performances
4758553 in only angels have wings howard hawks had a story to tell and he has done it inspiringly well
4758554 its unusual to find yourself laughing in a movie not because something is funny but because its so wickedly clever
4758555 if one does not love the films of howard hawks one cannot love cinema
4758556 although most of our riders are under contract until december 31 2008 and we are not obligated to release them prior to this date we have decided that even though we think we will have a new sponsor signed by the end of november for continental team status in 2009 we do not want to put the riders in a position of not being able to obtain employment in the event our sponsorship contract is not ultimately signed leaving the riders in a bad spot
4758557 its truly a pity that we were not able to get a contract signed in time to keep our family together going forward even though we have a couple of sponsors who can potentially sign in the coming months
4758558 in any other industry this rule would qualify as age discrimination but not in the world of cycling where a team cannot race without a uci approved team license governed exclusively by uci rules and issued by each countries home cycling federation who are required to enforce such rules today i was forced to tell my riders that although i have money burning a hole in my pocket to support the team and we have contractual commitments from many of our current sponsors for 2009 we cannot give them a job because they are either too old or we dont have enough time to sign our new sponsor by the imposed uci deadline to become either a continental or pro continental team in 2009
4758559 if our team continues we will certainly have some significant changes due to the new uci rules we are looking forward to securing a new partner for the 2009 season by the end of november who can benefit from and build their brand by being associated with our world class organization we are confident another sponsor will capitalize on the value united pro cycling team generates with our 25 000 registered fans eight figure annual measurable media exposure 3 3 million annual onsite spectators and the charitable work our team does in the communities we race in

4758590 we know this is a war between the west and russia
4758591 it is unlikely that ossetians and abkhazians will be able to live with georgians in one state
4758592 the russian attack on georgia had profound implications and will have profound implications for russias relations with its neighbors and with the world
4758593 who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here not only those people who perpetrated this are responsible but also those people who failed to stop them
4758594 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4758595 yes ideally we would like a vote formalising the ceasefire this weekend
4758596 but well take as long as it takes we are not going to push for a vote if we know that the russians will veto the text which does not mean we have to give in to all their demands there has to be hard bargaining

4758602 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4758603 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4758690 it is important to recognize that it is not for us to consider as a matter of policy whether homeschooling should be permitted in california that job is for the legislature it is not the duty of the courts to make the law we endeavor to interpret it
4758691 i made a commitment four years ago to being on this team and i did everything i could to be here

4758704 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4758705 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

4758710 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

4758714 mike first off i just want to say thank you so much the techniques i learned from butterfly marketing played a big part in helping me make 63 249 in sales in 24 hours as i write this im still finding it hard to believe it seems a lifetime ago that the bfm package landed on my doorstep and i started poring over it with my smile getting larger and wider with each new insight as i realized that as long as i applied what i was learning the principles were going to make something big happen little did i know just how big it would be when i launched adsense videos adsense videos 33 hours after launch the site went live my life changed forever seriously the results have been incredible mike weve grossed over 200 000 in 7 days the site got an alexa ranking on launch day of 351 adsense videos was ranked number 1 on the clickbank marketplace in the marketing category just 4 days after the launch ive also been getting on average one new subscriber every minute of every hour for the past six and a half days so what did i learn from you mike and from butterfly marketing where to start i think one of the biggest things was the step by step approach everything i created for affiliates joint venture partners and for people going through the videos themselves has been step by step i made everything as easy as i could and muppet proof as i like to call it i also realized that its paying attention to the smaller details before launch that really pay dividends after the launch and boy am i seeing that you gave some absolute gems of advice in butterfly marketing which have without a shadow of a doubt contributed in a big way to the overall success of adsense videos thanks again michael cheney

4758729 we must be proactive in sustaining both the lobster resource and the lobster industry which employs thousands of citizens many in economically depressed areas
4758730 the lobster fisherys continued success is particularly dependent on the long term health of the lobster and its habitat both of which are major and continuing research priorities of the lobster institute through its core initiative we have maines congressional delegation to thank for helping us secure this much needed funding to monitor the health of the premier fishery of the northeast
4758731 this format will allow us to collaborate and to build upon work thats already been done
4758732 it will help us to be efficient to avoid duplication and to move toward the research stage quickly the coalition will also unify efforts to obtain the necessary research funding
4758733 we intend to develop a regionwide lobster health program focusing on pathogen biology and disease epidemiology with strategies for prevalence testing disease diagnostics and health management
4758734 a successful coalition will create a major communications channel among scientists and those who work in the industry
4758735 it will be instrumental in safeguarding the lobster stock from current and rapidly emerging diseases thus helping secure the future viability of the lobster industry once firmly established this coalition will serve as a model for tackling other issues of concern to the lobster industry a model that can then translate to other fisheries as well

4758795 it is our statutory role to check this unacceptable level of quackery which poses enormous danger to the patients and the public robbing unsuspecting innocent nigerians of their money without corresponding value and make nonesense of the profession
4758796 these are the main areas where quacks have had a field day x rays centres abound everywhere and unqualified and unlicensed persons dispense ionizing radiation on unsuspecting patients especially students who go for medical examinations as part of admission requirements
4758797 it is equally worse with the practice of ultra sounds untrained persons subject nigerians to such examinations without understanding the basics and not only deny them of their money but operate further to worsen their condition by issuing fake results which in most cases have led to unnecessary and avoidable surgical operations

4758824 this is like trying to put a wind farm in yellowstone national park as far as were concerned
4758825 environmentalism is fashionable among this crowd but they still drive suvs to save the whale rallies
4758826 all the money being splashed around to kill off the wind farm is a scandal
4758827 the turbines are a perfect marriage between nature and technology and we have had working windmills throughout our heritage in new england
4758828 we want people to sit on the beach see the windmills and make the connection between the energy they consume and its production for too long people have ignored the pollution caused by oil and coal

4758852 i knew i had to be within half a bodylength at the turn
4758853 i race against crocker all the time he has front half speed if i had half a bodylength i knew i would be fine when i saw crocker at the turn i knew cavic would be somewhere with him i could sort of see him out of the corner of my eye
4758854 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that cost me the race but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision it turned out to be in my favor
4758855 when people say things about that it just fires me up
4758856 it was like the 400 free relay one of the french swimmers alain bernard said something to get us going we use things like that comments like that to fuel us to get us even more excited thats what americans do we rise to the occasion when bob first told me that i said okay were going to let our swimming do the talking ill always welcome comments like that anyone who wants to say something i like it it definitely motivates me

4758862 perhaps friends of dick cheney helped to write this rule
4758863 i think most of us had been hoping for something simple and relatively accommodating to a new industry interested in pilot and demonstration projects
4758864 on the surface at least a set of new rules as thick as a phonebook sends a strong signal that the infant renewable energy industry should expect a very heavy regulatory hand from the interior department
4758865 some large company with more money like exxon could step in and take the site over
4758866 we are still in the process of reviewing this document and we applaud mms for their careful and thorough work

4758872 this lack of clearly outlined authority was a significant impediment to the development of renewable energy on the ocs and dampened efforts by potential energy developers and federal regulators to seriously develop and consider offshore projects
4758873 no sensible developer will consider placing a wave tidal or current energy project on the ocs
4758874 we will stay away from the ocs as long as the regulatory authority is unclear contradictory or unduly burdensome

4758877 thats money i could have put in my childrens college fund
4758878 john ended up dishonoring an awful lot of people in this process from his family to a lot of his supporters
4758879 his campaign even in light of all this served a purpose
4758880 it forced the other democratic candidates to talk about things they otherwise would not have talked about poverty has not been an issue for a long time it is now because john edwards forced the other democrats to talk about it
4758881 i could think of better ways to spend that money than on his girlfriends videos
4758882 i just didnt stick to my race plan and got pushed about a bit
4758883 it is another one for the memory bank im not going to say im happy to make the semis but i can learn from it
4758884 gov ritter and i are doing this all over the state
4758885 we want to talk about changes that were implementing through the p 20 education coordinating council p is for preschool and the 20 is to get us all ready for graduate school
4758886 the exit clause is a normal part of transfer negotiations these days its not unusual
4758887 during my time here we have been asked to include exit clauses in contracts but have managed to resist it
4758888 sometimes players ask for an exit clause and less money but we dont have any players at the club who have one
4758889 champions league football is crucial to keeping a champions league squad
4758890 it is good in the short term for finance and good in the long term for profile
4758891 thats why we can go to japan and attract players like shunsuke nakamura
4758892 i watched the game and it was a game between two good sides and accies did very well
4758893 a lot of teams who were in the bottom six last year put in good performances in their first game so it didnt surprise me that accies did the same
4758894 we will look at what weve got first but united are a good side
4758895 they have got good players who have did very well last season
4758896 noel hunt has moved on and he was a good player for them but they keep turning up good players
4758897 we will have to improve if we want to repeat the success we had last season
4758898 the more we win the more other people want to knock us off our perch
4758899 but when you look at barcelona they have gone out and signed some really good players real madrid look good and inter milan will be strong under jose mourinho
4758900 they have great experienced players who are obviously not happy with us winning the league two years in a row
4758901 they have signed some new players as well and got a new manager so they will make it tough for us while i think liverpool will close the gap this season as well
4758902 it will be interesting to see how arsenal go on given the players they have lost
4758903 any other team would struggle given the players they seem to lose on a regular basis but somehow they seem to stay up there
4758904 this could be a tough season for them but somehow arsene wenger always seems to do the business with his players
4758905 the beauty of playing for a club like this is that the players want to improve
4758906 you see paul scholes and ryan giggs leading the way doing extra in the weights room and our training games are sometimes a better standard than premier league games
4758907 you soon find out a draw is a bad result at this club in fact there have even been times when we have won and said afterwards our performance probably was not good enough
4758908 but that pressure to perform also means if we play to our potential we will pretty much beat everyone
4758909 that is what we need to focus on because if we achieve that on a regular basis we have a very good chance of being champions again
4758910 cristiano has been doing excellently he is well ahead of schedule the specialist was surprised the condition he was in
4758911 the next three weeks he will have rehab and then the next part will be endurance work and serious running before he goes into the football side with us
4758912 there has been no problem his progress has been great he has never missed a session morning or afternoon we are pencilling him in for the beginning of october
4758913 at the start of last season i was asked if ronaldo could score more than 25 goals and i replied i was looking for improvement
4758914 improvement can come in different ways for ronaldo this season 42 goals is a target it is still possible for him to achieve that given the talent of the boy and his goalscoring ability but you have to say it is a big target
4758915 where you will see the improvement is in his authority and decision making which improves with experience experience gives you a lot of things timing especially
4758916 he is such a willing performer that you are always tempted to listen to him at times
4758917 he says he could play centre midfield centre half goalkeeper if you ask him to do a job he will no problem
4758918 they said they werent willing to give me an extended contract
4758919 so that gives me no option but to get my head down thats not a problem
4758920 lets get one thing straight i want to sign for fulham hopefully in time they will extend my contract
4758921 we are interested in the american boy and we are trying to get him
4758922 but that depends on a work permit so it will be a few days before we know about that
4758923 we had asked maurice johnston if he thought there were any players in the american league whom he thought would do well and he recommended two or three players
4758924 the clubs dont own the players over there so the mls are happy to let him go we are in the final stages of tying everything up but we still have to apply for the work permit
4758925 he is only 22 and has played the last number of internationals so id hope we will get him all right and hes played in the olympics
4758926 it really is a tremendous honour to sign for a club of celtics stature

4759159 they brought in paratroopers we screamed to the world stop it and there were some statements from washington but i have to tell you that for most of the european countries there was pretty muted and quiet reaction to all this

4759165 yes saudi intelligence chief prince muqrin bin abdul aziz did visit pakistan on friday and met senior government officials
4759166 the main purpose of the visit was to find an amicable solution to the musharraf impeachment issue and that no one should become a laughing stock
4759167 saudi arabia is a very strong ally of both pakistan and the us and the visit was a sincere and friendly effort to interact with all and sundry to settle the issue

4759185 every time you watch tv you feed the beast you help legitimize the view of the world at it is presented on television television is filled with sexist imagery and messages its filled with racist stereotypes now and then when im visiting someone and i watch some tv im always shocked at just how bad it is especially the sexism when you dont watch it every day these things jump out at you more so im just going to make the suggestion that you give tuning out a try if you have not already dont let people waste your leisure time trying to sell you products so they can make a profit this might not be so bad if they didnt insult you while they were doing it but they do i mean why put up with it its just not worth it when you watch tv you end up talking about the shows you become their little promotions machine that tries to get other people to watch its just so invasive when you think about it so im going to just put it out there turn it off screw em any day is a good day why not today

4759191 this gives them an outlet to share and discuss their passion on issues they care about
4759192 there are a lot of people who have a great deal of knowledge about living sustainable and environmental lifestyles within the county
4759193 theres not enough food for a humpback whale in the baltic sea
4759194 the baltic sea is a connecting sea to the north sea fish and the whale could have easily followed the current flowing into the baltic sea
4759195 it is also possible that the whale became confused because of underwater noises
4759196 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
4759197 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
4759198 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites

4759200 perhaps you have noticed that the creeds speak of the birth of jesus and then of his death
4759201 the seed of true humanity is within you follow it
4759202 in him jesus christ we live and move and have our being
4759203 there is one body one spirit just as one hope is the goal of your calling by god there is one lord one faith one baptism and one god and father of all over all through all and within all
4759204 take every care to preserve the unity of the spirit by the peace that binds you together
4759205 there is one body one spirit just as one hope is the goal of your calling by god there is one lord one faith one baptism and one god and father of all over all through all and within all

4759222 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body

4759238 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4759239 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4759240 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4759241 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4759242 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4759243 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4759244 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4759245 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4759246 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4759247 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
4759248 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4759249 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4759250 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4759251 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4759252 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4759253 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4759254 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4759255 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4759256 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4759257 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4759258 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4759259 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4759260 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4759261 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4759262 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4759263 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4759264 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4759265 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4759266 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4759267 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4759268 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4759269 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4759270 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4759271 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4759272 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4759273 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4759274 jag k nde mig som en ny m nniska n r jag l mnade byggnaden
4759275 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4759276 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4759277 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4759278 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4759279 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4759280 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4759281 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4759282 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4759283 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4759284 what do you want your look to say to people
4759285 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4759286 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4759287 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4759288 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4759289 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4759290 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4759291 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4759292 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4759293 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4759294 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4759295 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4759296 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4759297 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4759298 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4759299 once you got past the convoluted system they have for moving funds from one line item to another
4759300 as it turned out the information is hidden in plain sight
4759301 if you take the total amount of the approved budget and you total up all the expenditures from each department then deduct the expenditures from the budget you come out with a minus figure a minus in the millions of dollars range
4759302 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4759303 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4759304 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4759305 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4759306 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4759307 just so you all know we did set a record
4759308 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4759309 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4759310 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4759311 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4759312 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4759313 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4759314 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4759315 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4759316 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4759317 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4759318 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4759319 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4759320 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4759321 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4759322 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4759323 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4759324 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4759325 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4759326 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4759327 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4759328 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4759329 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4759330 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4759331 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4759332 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4759333 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4759334 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
4759335 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4759336 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
4759337 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4759338 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4759339 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4759340 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4759341 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4759342 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4759343 jag ska aldrig igen uttala mig om att brottare r barnsliga
4759344 verraskningen jag kokade ihop i f rra veckan v ntar p sitt avsl jande

4759346 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4759347 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4759348 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4759349 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4759350 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4759351 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4759352 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4759353 these robotic policemen wiped out all of cambridge in one day of carnage what have you got to say about that
4759354 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4759355 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4759356 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4759357 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4759358 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4759359 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4759360 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4759361 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4759362 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4759363 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4759364 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4759365 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4759366 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4759367 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4759368 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4759369 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4759370 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4759371 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4759372 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4759373 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4759374 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4759375 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4759376 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4759377 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4759378 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4759379 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4759380 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4759381 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4759382 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4759383 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4759384 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4759385 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4759386 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4759387 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4759388 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4759389 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4759390 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4759391 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4759392 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4759393 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4759394 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4759395 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4759396 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4759397 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4759398 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4759399 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4759400 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4759401 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks

4759426 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4759427 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4759428 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4759429 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4759430 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4759431 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4759432 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4759433 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4759434 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4759435 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4759436 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4759437 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4759438 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4759439 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4759440 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4759441 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4759442 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4759443 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4759444 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4759445 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4759446 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4759447 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4759448 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4759449 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4759450 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4759451 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4759452 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4759453 were not getting carried away but it is a big pressure release
4759454 prince was presented with the medical advice and knew the risks
4759455 its not too bad i was just happy to get through the whole 80 minutes i didnt really sleep that much last night
4759456 i get targeted every week so its not a problem with me i was very happy to win tonight and get through the game unscathed
4759457 we really dug deep and worked hard for each other
4759458 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4759459 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4759460 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4759461 guess what since we werent invited to so and sos party wouldnt have gone anyway we are going to see lynard skynard in concert at the venue at the horseshoe casino
4759462 i like a couple songs but it doesnt make me want to go see them in concert
4759463 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4759464 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4759465 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4759466 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4759467 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4759468 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4759469 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4759470 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4759471 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4759472 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4759473 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4759474 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4759475 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4759476 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4759477 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4759478 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4759479 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4759480 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4759481 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4759482 la idea era realizar la intervenci n en 2007 cuando iniciamos la campa a en los medios de comunicaci n para captar voluntarias
4759483 no se han presentado m s pacientes porque hay que tener en cuenta que estas mujeres consideran normal la ablaci n
4759484 las que lo han hecho es porque son segunda generaci n o vinieron cuando eran muy peque as y buscan una integraci n total a la sociedad
4759485 en este per odo se comprueba la sensibilidad al tacto
4759486 de forma global se considera que esta intervenci n da resultados en un 90 y de est mulo en un 75
4759487 en senegal por ejemplo la que no lo tiene hecho es apartada
4759488 como mujeres antes de ser intervenidas saben de lo que carecen lo que les cuesta es aprender de su sexualidad una vez que recuperan la sensibilidad
4759489 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4759490 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4759491 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4759492 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4759493 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4759494 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4759495 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4759496 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4759497 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4759498 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4759499 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4759500 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4759501 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4759502 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4759503 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4759504 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4759505 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4759506 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4759507 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4759508 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4759509 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4759510 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4759511 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4759512 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4759513 i have indeed seen the suffering of my people i have heard how they cry out
4759514 the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself that in its essence is fascism ownership of government by an individual by a group or by any controlling private power
4759515 macro investors are torn between two views were in something like the 1970s or were in something like the 1930s
4759516 the world continues to go through a period of adjustment from excess and the mispricing of risk
4759517 i dont think that it would be remotely possible to say that this is coming to an end
4759518 now lets talk rust proofing these colecosll rust up on ya like
4759519 look out at the corner of 12th and main because im going to be sick
4759520 make you the good government just how you like it
4759521 how do you say fractured english its what his parents spoke at home
4759522 more than half of likely voters nationwide 55 want republican turned libertarian bob barr to participate in presidential debates this fall while nearly half 46 said they think ralph nader should be allowed into the on stage fray
4759523 and a majority of republicans and democrats agreed among democrats 52 said they think barr should participate while 50 of republicans agreed thirty nine percent of democrats and 41 of republicans said they did not think barr should be included in the debates the younger the respondent the more likely they were to say that barr should be included
4759524 my apology to ralph nader for not demanding that he be included in the debates
4759525 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
4759526 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south

4759562 the towns conservation and health departments continue to take the necessary precautions to minimize exposure to mosquitoes
4759563 the towns mosquito management program under the conservation department has been treating all catch basins and known breeding areas in town with a non toxic larvicide since early april and continues to do so

4759580 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4759581 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4759582 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4759583 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4759584 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4759585 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4759586 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4759587 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4759588 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

4759591 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4759592 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4759593 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4759594 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4759595 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4759596 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4759597 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4759598 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4759599 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4759600 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4759601 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4759602 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4759603 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4759604 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4759605 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4759606 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4759607 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4759608 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4759609 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4759610 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4759611 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4759612 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4759613 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4759614 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4759615 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4759616 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4759617 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4759618 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4759619 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4759620 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4759621 who are open to doing something on the production side
4759622 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4759623 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4759624 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4759625 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4759626 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4759627 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4759628 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4759629 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4759630 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4759631 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4759632 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4759633 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4759634 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4759635 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4759636 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4759637 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4759638 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4759639 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4759640 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4759641 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4759642 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4759643 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4759644 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4759645 there are more gold medals up for grabs and thats kind of what we are going for
4759646 what is it going to mean to her gosh a lot
4759647 its hard to compare my era with these kids because they had endorsements and all this stuff before it is going to enhance that absolutely
4759648 nastia has this universal appeal with her beauty and grace fans are just dying to find someone like nastia that they can cheer for
4759649 this really changes things what she did was in front of a global audience
4759650 the gold medal creates a long term strategy for us to talk about not just the next six months but years literally years the billions of dollars being spent in the marketplace to attract people like nastia i think there are going to be a number of companies that want to spread some of that wealth around
4759651 i am still fighting for that medal count with him
4759652 i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed
4759653 obviously it was a huge day in american gymnastics oh my gosh
4759654 i knew it was going to be gold and silver i just didnt know who was going to get gold and who silver it was a great battle both hit 4 for 4 nastia came out on top and performed a little better
4759655 its a competition i believe shawn didnt lose shawn did not lose nastia got the gold but shawn did not lose
4759656 i asked olympic officials to conduct a doping test in beijing but i was refused and i decided to get back home and prove that i could compete at the olympics
4759657 i thought denver would be my last stop but things happened and here i am
4759658 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4759659 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4759660 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4759661 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4759662 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4759663 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4759664 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4759665 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4759666 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4759667 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4759668 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4759669 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4759670 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4759671 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4759672 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4759673 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4759674 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4759675 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4759676 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4759677 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4759678 i have a lot of space for a gold medal hopefully i can get it hopefully well be able to and ill be able to show people a new one
4759679 the usoc has been very supportive which has allowed us to create a new level of consistency among our elite athletes
4759680 that was our biggest challenge in the past they would get to this level and no further now they perform consistent routines and they qualified for the olympics
4759681 the goal is to keep more athletes involved at the elite level and work with them to elevate their skill level
4759682 we had one in the backyard to goof off on
4759683 but it is nothing like the ones at the gym its way more bouncy in the gym youre never going all that high at home
4759684 i was loving it and so i stuck with it
4759685 we have artistic gymnasts who no longer are interested in that who could do great skills on the trampoline
4759686 we need to get more athletes at the elite level training to set a higher bar
4759687 one of our challenges is keeping a strong grass roots base and having this in the olympics gives us the motivation to promote the sport
4759688 one of the things about trampoline every gym facility has one its a fundamental piece of training equipment for the sport of gymnastics
4759689 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4759690 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4759691 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4759692 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4759693 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4759694 theres nothing i regret coming into this competition i wouldnt have imagined taking silver im completely happy he deserves it
4759695 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4759696 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4759697 i said i was going to kiss the medal if i got that gold everyone bites it
4759698 i was going to make out with mine i guess ill have to wait another four years to do that
4759699 i feel i could have done more that i didnt lay it all out there
4759700 im very upset i didnt attack more i shouldve fought harder
4759701 its the olympic games were not coming in here and expecting a medal to land in our lap
4759702 on one hand its a pity no gold on the other hand thank god i got the bronze i appreciate this medal
4759703 she was quite strong so i should accept the result
4759704 its insane now more than 100 bands to play three stages

4759708 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4759709 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can engage the work to achieve national healing and reconciliation
4759710 attend to the matter of reconstruction and development of zimbabwe and in this way extricate the masses of the people from the dire straits in which they find themselves
4759711 im certain that the millions of zimbabweans both inside and outside zimbabwe await with great expectations and high hopes a positive outcome from our deliberations
4759712 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4759713 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4759714 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4759715 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4759716 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

4759744 my biology teacher and textbook promoted a walking fish leaving the ancient seas to become a dinosaur i felt something was fishy but it took me awhile to understand the faulty scientific implications of darwinism later i was obligated to teach the same evolutionary material
4759745 too many of my own biology students who professed faith were stumbling over the monkey to men pictures in the books id give them for their benefit i would bring darwinism into question but tread softly because of the disfavor voiced by administration and an occasional parent

4759752 students study the scientific concept of biological evolution the changes in populations of organisms through time in order to understand diversity and relatedness within the living world inquiries into evolution explain the ways in which natural processes produce lifes diversity these studies help students understand that evolution is the major unifying concept in the biological sciences and that it explains a wide variety of observations that can be made about the living world in particular students see that the study of evolution initiates questions about biodiversity adaptation genetics mutations the geological record and the observed unity at molecular and whole organism levels this content standard does not define any student expectations related to the origin of life

4759777 the majority of africans today are poorer than those who lived in the stone age era
4759778 africans ought to drive their own age of enlightenment by asking such basic questions as to why a continent rich in minerals is perceived to be poorer than the rest of the world
4759779 this could be done by ensuring that all african children are educated to believe in themselves and to have confidence in african values in order to dispel the notion that anything african was inferior
4759780 european history is dotted with tribalism ethnicity superstition extreme religious beliefs repressive kingdoms and wars but that ought not to be an excuse for africans to celebrate the lesson europe offers however is that the exploitation of an inquiring mind a mind that was willing to be rebellious and give reason the power to shape peoples lives is what gave birth to europe as we know it today

4759837 s e prima di ogni cosa voglio dedicare questa mia doppietta a giovanni e la sua famiglia pap ugo e mamma maria
4759838 io voglio innanzitutto ringraziare reja per la fiducia che mi ha concesso mi ha seguito e spronato molto dallinizio del ritiro sono molto contento di aver ripagato la fiducia del mister anche perch questi gol ci aprono le porte della coppa uefa non sar certo una formalit al san paolo ma abbiamo gi messo in tasca una grossa fetta di qualificazione
4759839 beh alla fine i gol sono tutti importanti se sono belli ancora meglio perch aiutano a guadagnare fiducia nei propri mezzi forse il primo ha avuto maggiore valore perch ha sbloccato la partita ma io sono soprattutto contento che il napoli abbia vinto convincendo anche nel gioco i gol servono a portare qualcosa di concreto e laltra sera ci siamo riusciti
4759840 col tanque mi trovo a meraviglia perch fa tanto movimento e crea spazi mi ha anche fornito uno splendido assist per sia io che lui aspettiamo che arrivino gli altri che torni il pocho che riprenda al cento per cento zalayeta abbiamo un parco attaccanti davvero forte e competitivo e per questo c da essere lieti e tranquilli
4759841 a dire il vero per molti di noi un bellissimo sogno che speriamo continui il pi a lungo possibile poi per il resto vivremo alla giornata e vedremo cosa di buono ci riserver il tempo di certo ci troveremo a giocare su pi fronti ma siamo preparati e coscienti delle nostre possibilit siamo un gruppo unito e solido ed questa probabilmente la vera forza di questa squadra al di l di chi vada in campo
4759842 s e devo confessare che in passato non ho avuto sempre questo tipo di concentrazione forse sono stato talvolta una testa calda ma fa parte anche della vita di un calciatore probabilmente questo per me il periodo della piena maturazione e sono contento di attraversarlo proprio al napoli quando sono arrivato in ritiro mi sono detto j questo il tuo momento per me era ed una ferma convinzione quella di poter giocare a certi livelli ci sto provando con tutte le mie forze ma se non fosse stato per la fiducia della societ per laiuto del mister e dei compagni non sarei riuscito mai a fare tutto da solo per questo ringrazio il napoli per la stima e laffetto che ha dimostrato nei miei confronti e spero di continuare su questa strada il bello comincia adesso
