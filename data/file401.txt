4010050 por el momento pareciera que el gobierno est jugando un papel bastante sucio porque est descabezando al movimiento obrero y huanuni se ha caracterizado por ser la vanguardia en las luchas sindicales por esa raz n no se debe ingresar al juego del gobierno
4010051 yo entiendo a los compa eros que se encuentran dolidos por la muerte de nuestros compa eros mineros en caihuasi que fue por culpa del gobierno pero no se tiene que poner a un lado a nuestras entes matrices a nuestros dirigentes porque eso es lo que quiere el gobierno es decir dividir al movimiento obrero para reinar
4010052 en huanuni se har la sucesi n de cargos para que no se debilite este valeroso sindicato por lo que no existe crisis sindical y quienes estar n al frente del sindicato de los mineros de huanuni delinear n la lucha de los trabajadores por los intereses de los movimiento obrero

4010115 growing from humble beginnings on the streets of san francisco to a lifestyle brand in a few short years is remarkable each year we strive to build on the success of previous icer air events and were very excited about future plans for a multi city esurance icer air tour starting in 2009
4010116 esurance is again thrilled to be the title sponsor of such a great event our partnership with icer air has produced some great results and were proud to help make such a signature event possible
4010117 were very excited about the evolution of the event and the upcoming tour because esurance is committed to helping our large sponsorships get even greener were also very enthusiastic about the green aspects of esurance icer air 2008
4010118 i think its kind of the difference between people that go and see movies and people that go and see films completely different audiences dont get them mixed up
4010119 saying somebodys a casual player is doing them a disservice because there are people playing bejewelled for twelve hours in a go i wouldnt have ever played a game for more than a couple of hours in one go so i think the terms are maybe mistaken somewhat
4010120 i think its more the style of game something you can sit down and play in chunks rather than having to sit down for three hours to play the next chapter of the game whatever that it
4010121 there are all these games now there was an article recently that there are three or four different types of guitar controller now who has that kind of storage space
4010122 i think people need to be a lot more aware particularly on the download side of things for psn or xbla of exactly what controllers are there
4010123 people have guitar controllers what else can you do with that a different style of guitar game or a banjo game banjo hero maybe
4010124 but to be fair i think a lot of the platform holders are telling people to look at that use the camera use the peripherals dance mats and so on these things are out there in quite large numbers but therere really only a couple of games that are actually taking advantage of them

4010154 one death is one too many but this road has taken too many lives and thats what i want to stop we are looking at a range of measures including making the road a single carriageway
4010155 finding a solution to accidents on the a1307 remains one of my top priorities
4010156 it was a very positive meeting what was interesting was that police said that out of 11 recent fatalities only one of them was down to speed while the others were caused by bad driving
4010157 last month i announced a package of further improvements the county council will undertake including fasttracking a review of speed limits along the road a new safety camera and a series of warning signs that tell motorists to take extra care along the road
4010158 these will be in place next month we are also waiting to start work on a junction improvement at cardinals green where two teenagers died in separate accidents
4010159 i think it went quite well no one thinks that this can solve the problems on the a1307 overnight but we did have a positive meeting
4010160 i know that matt wants to work at making this road safer and i will be on his back to make sure it happens
4010161 every day police officers put their lives on the line to safeguard people and property with disregard for their own safety how do you put a price on this
4010162 the fairest mechanism of reward is to abolish the bonuses and special priority payments and have fairer national pay across the board commensurate with officers vital role in society
4010163 this is a national bonus scheme which we along with other forces across the country adhere to
4010164 we do not trust brands anymore we trust individuals friendly familiar authority figures with whom we feel great affinity these are the people we trust and those from whom we would always welcome honest suggestions and tips and when they are spontaneous or clearly disclosed even those of commercial nature
4010165 bottom up advertising with publishers selecting the favorite brands they would want to endorse
4010166 in reality bloggers or other similar online authority figures could publicly pre elect companies and brands that they would want to be brand ambassadors for they could do this directly on their sites and or via their representative advertising agencies this advertising model would provide companies embracing it with a communication vehicle with much higher impact and effectiveness that anything they have done so far via traditional advertising it is likely that such brands would need multiple such brand ambassadors addressing the many different target audiences making up their potential customer base to independent publishers and online bloggers this advertising model would offer the opportunity to re synch communication with marketing instead of keeping them tightly separate while guaranteeing also a longer and more stable revenue stream it would also offer the opportunity for individual publishers to leverage their authority and influence to convey messages and promotions for products and companies they truly believe in
4010167 yes you say but you are going to be influenced by those who pay you yes i answer but so do you with the people that spend big money on your site with traditional advertising and if that is not so how in any case can people tell how can they find out whether the new review article or link you did was a consequence of a return favor you are doing to an advertising agency or to a past direct advertiser who would want to come back unless you have some very strict and public disclosure policy about this info it is going only through your actions over time that people will be able to tell whether you have your own integrity or whether you are simply a marketing puppet at the service of whoever pays you more
4010168 every couple of years brings forth a new generation of listeners another wave to hear the music and claim it as their own that might make you feel older but it can also make you feel somewhat wiser too some of us know that one day rickys skintight leather pants sean combs phat furs and marilyn mansons trash cum glam gear will look every bit as fabulous and silly as the same duds once worn by the lizard king vintage shaft era isaac hayes and alice cooper in his ingenue days

4010175 the bees got one run in each of the first three innings and they could have had much more but he was able to minimize the damage and when you can do that you give your own team a chance to help you
4010176 the satisfaction is that our ballclub is considered one of the better teams in the league and thats despite roster changes and everything else they come out and play the game and what im happiest about is the way they go about their business
4010177 i took those two swings my last at bat on the first one i felt like a little grab on my side on the second one i felt something a lot more significant the last pitch i kind of panicked i didnt know what to do i didnt think i could swing i was kind of hoping hed just flop a curveball or something ive never had this happen to me before its frustrating
4010178 i cant really stand up straight i feel like keeping bent over it feels a lot more comfortable and getting up out of a chair isnt the greatest thing
4010179 obviously coach lane hes a new coach for me this year and he really doesnt know me
4010180 basically all i know is what ive done against him in games being critical ive been through way too much of that i know me and i know my body so the only thing i could say is if the criticism was something kiffin would really harp on put on the video tapes and watch what ive done
4010181 its just in my competitive nature to where once you start playing games even out here i start getting really really amped
4010182 ive got to learn to really start toning myself down because it still is preseason you see your defense every day so its good to go against someone different and let your frustration out on them because youre not going to let it out on your own team
4010183 ive been very critical of javon throughout this camp and throughout the offseason and hes had a string right here of the best practices hes had
4010184 he looks to be in the right frame of mind lately and so if we can continue to work on that and push that its going in a positive direction
4010185 im doing something that i truly love and am excited about taking it into the season
4010186 getting ready for the regular season is all about getting your body right especially a body like mine and what its going through
4010187 two a days yeah you can get out here and work but youve got to know when to tone it down you just dont want to do so much out here to where you go into the game and everything is bothering you
4010188 im going to apply a little pressure to the practice how well we practice will determine whether we practice in the afternoon

4010206 really what were doing for the first time is fusing the worlds of cinema and game playing into a single medium think about taking what used to be hundreds if not thousands of servers that were required to render an image and reducing it almost to a single chip so you can have a game experience which is cinematic and even a cinematic experience in which you can get to play with the characters
4010207 its actually quite amazing we showed some video footage of a new york street and when you first look at it you go thats easy you just go out and film it whats interesting is that as you pull back you discover its actually not a new york street its a rendered image of new york street the taxis look like taxies the buildings look like buildings but theyre actually just an electronic set

4010212 lane sat down with me earlier today and told me he didnt want me to play in the game but i practiced so far this week so its no biggie to go in there and get a couple snaps
4010213 just depends on how it goes obviously were trying to figure out what is wrong

4010226 weve never stopped playing we took a leave of absence in the 80s due to disco most record labels wanted a group to give them a heartbeat which we had but they didnt acknowledge
4010227 other than that weve always appeared live theres been a change of the guards but never a reform
4010228 every time we play live on stage we create new material we just have to plan to take some of the new material on stage to the studio or to a warehouse and start writing to the musical creativity that weve created on stage while we played
4010229 its all a matter of time frame because now were busy with the dvd were on tour maybe during the slow time of being on tour which is usually the fall but we seem to have a newer audience who are curious about the old school
4010230 im honored to know people are giving us the time of day i believe the younger generation listens to their parents i believe that the biggest part of communicating between parents and kids is in music the only things the people listened to from their parents were from music i think the kids are bouncing off of that and theyre curious about how it created their parents frame of mind
4010231 its timeless they the songs came out of jams and thats what makes them timeless thats what i tell my band when you play on stage dont start thinking just play i dont know the word rehearsal i colorado rock fans might recall when war shown in 2007 played one of its biggest shows ever appearing with the doobie brothers golden earring and henry gross at cus folsom stadium on may 10 1975 photos by ross brandes amp gregory springer dont know the word practice when you talk about rehearsing war music i dont know what youre talking about thats how ive always looked it and thats how it should be

4010243 lets not talk about that and just hope it continues
4010244 we got good hitting both games and really good pitching
4010245 our bullpen came in and did a good job what else can i say
4010246 we were behind 4 0 by the second inning both games
4010247 today i was doing the rain dance in the first inning hoping the rain would come because i felt that bad in the bullpen
4010248 today was one of those days where i hope i dont feel like this too often
4010249 its one of those things that are going to happen and you got to throw them out
4010250 youre not going to get anywhere by thinking about your last start or what happened the last time against these guys
4010251 its hard when you get traded you put a lot of pressure on yourself i think junior has swung the bat better the last couple of days
4010252 it is clear from cctv footage that the accused has extended his leg behind his body and kicked the victim in the face with considerable force
4010253 when asked what condition the victim was in at the time the accused stated that the victim was in a very bad way he was not moving was not making a sound and he was bleeding from the nose
4010254 the accused was unsure if the victim was even alive at all
4010255 the accused is a risk to the community due to evidence of offending in all areas he was attached to in nsw
4010256 he has restrictions placed upon him concerning pastoral duties involving children due to a previous conviction police alleged
4010257 the accused is working in a catholic library situated opposite the local catholic school
4010258 the following allegations outline 18 victims of various child sex offences police said in their statement to the court

4010262 we were looking for a physical fullback hes 6 foot 235 now in college football generally there is no fullback anymore we were looking for a guy with athleticism who would go out there and bang heads
4010263 he really showed up on film and special teams as a guy with speed who wasnt afraid to hit people the beauty of the practice squad is it gives you a chance to see people who otherwise would be out of the league
4010264 they thought i had the body type to translate to fullback
4010265 i talked it over with my agent things hadnt been going as well as id liked in washington i just saw it as a great opportunity a chance to start over
4010266 it took a long time to get comfortable at fullback especially with all the shifts and motions that offensive coordinator norv turner had
4010267 hitting somebody from the other side of the ball was a harder transition than i thought
4010268 he definitely has a chance to make the roster because hes one of our core guys on special teams
4010269 hes got instincts from playing both sides of the ball
4010270 hes a four way starter both punt teams and both kickoff teams moran is a different body type 6 1 250 hes more of a guard he can do the kickoff return team well and he can do field goals but hes a backup coverage type body hes not as versatile as zak is because zak has more speed and more athletic ability
4010271 he has a standard of work ethic and toughness that was unsurpassed
4010272 he was a sideline to sideline player at linebacker but we also played him at tight end fullback and tailback he knew how to use leverage he understood the game
4010273 a safety came up to hit him and landed 5 yards deep in the end zone zak just trucked him we knew then that he was a special player
4010274 he twice led the conference in tackles every team had to game plan for him

4010309 i was fast asleep when loud noises and slogan shouting woke me up it was like the early 1990s everybody was on the road in our area but hardly anybody had any idea about what actually had happened
4010310 there were two unforgettable moments for me on this tour
4010311 one the audience at all our performances was incredible and second the press in the us has been very kind and generous
4010312 the seven americans were sent back to los angeles and should be arriving shortly
4010313 thats why we now find we are in a position to cut interest rates
4010314 we set out to bring inflation back within a target range and are confident we are on that path

4010324 people need to be waking up to the realities of the world and that the days of easy money have come to a pretty sudden end
4010325 there is an awful lot of talk about big transfers and major demands of players but you will find throughout the uk and europe that money is not quite as easy to obtain as it used to be
4010326 were expecting the levels of transfer fees this summer to still to be quite high but probably not as high as the record that was set last summer
4010327 euro 2008 happened towards the start of the summer transfer window
4010328 the level of transfer activity at the start of a window sometimes decreases when there is a major tournament taking place
4010329 another factor is that the 2008 09 season is the second year of a three year broadcast deal and the level of broadcasting revenues to clubs this year will be broadly similar to what they received last year
4010330 so were not seeing a step change in the amount of revenues that clubs are getting year on year
4010331 another point is weve not seen anything like the number of changes in club ownership in the last 12 months compared to the previous 12 months
4010332 there arent several new owners of premier league clubs for whom this window is their first opportunity to buy and sell players so i think thats another factor
4010333 after the events of 2005 though i couldnt see pairing stories id written before the flood with those id written after for better or worse my life my outlook and necessarily my work has changed forever whatever else they may be the stories in this little collection now seem almost impossibly innocent to me
4010334 you probably only get a half dozen or so in a lifetime and thats if youre lucky
4010335 until i overcome this there will be no more truly good days no matter where i am no more cassowaries or mudskippers no more adventures except maybe the kind youre forced into no more coming home

4010390 eigentlich hat die kunst sich immer sehr bem ht sich der mode zu verweigern aber heute ist sie mit ihr eine symbiose eingegangen inzwischen ist mode auch so eine art inszenierung die weit ber das dekorative hinausgeht
4010391 ja doch sie kann einen mit dem ansinnen des bleibenwollens auch bedrohen nicht wahr ich meine alles ist verg nglich au erdem ist es ja auch nicht so dass man nach einer saison alles wegwirft ich entdecke oft kleider die drei vier jahre alt sind und denke ach so etwas sch nes f llt dir heute nicht mehr ein ich geh re ja noch zu den dinosauriern der mode die alles selbst machen
4010392 ja und irritation ich finde kleider die aussehen als br uchte man anziehhilfen unerotisch designer wie alexander mcqueen foltern frauen mit korsetts und st tzstangen meine kleider sollen so aussehen als ob jemand wie brigitte bardot direkt aus dem meer kommt wie damals in cannes ich sah das als junge die brauchte nur ein schlampiges t shirt dagegen wirkten alle anderen hollywood stars auf einmal wie alte gebrauchte cadillacs

4010415 das ziel ist es die sowjetunion wiederherzustellen wenn auch nicht in den alten grenzen
4010416 in s dossetien spielen russische soldaten auf den stra en mit den leichen georgischer zivilisten hunderte georgier werden verschleppt es kommt zu massenhinrichtungen was dort stattfindet sind ethnische s uberungen
4010417 das ist nicht wie 1968 bei der invasion der tschechoslowakei als russland seine nachbarn bedrohen eine hauptstadt besetzen eine regierung st rzen konnte
4010418 it is surely wrong for small vulnerable communities to suffer because of the actions of other more powerful resource rich countries

4010422 the effect was to draw the russians into the afghan trap
4010423 according to the official version of history cia aid to the mujahadeen began during 1980
4010424 that is to say after the soviet army invaded afghanistan 24 dec 1979 but the reality secretly guarded for years is completely otherwise indeed it was july 3 1979 that president carter signed the first directive for secret aid to the opponents of the pro soviet regime in kabul and that very day i wrote a note to the president in which i explained to him that in my opinion this aid was going to induce a soviet military intervention
4010425 we didnt push the russians to intervene but we knowingly increased the probability that they would
4010426 that secret operation was an excellent idea it had the effect of drawing the russians into the afghan trap and you want me to regret it the day that the soviets officially crossed the border i wrote to president carter we now have the opportunity of giving to the ussr its vietnam war indeed for almost 10 years moscow had to carry on a war unsupportable by the government a conflict that brought about the demoralization and finally the breakup of the soviet empire
4010427 what is most important to the history of the world the taliban or the collapse of the soviet empire some stirred up moslems or the liberation of central europe and the end of the cold war
4010428 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
4010429 the war began as an ill considered move by georgia to retake south ossetia by force saakashvilis larger goal was to lead his country into war as a form of calculated self sacrifice hoping that russias predictable overreaction would convince the west of exactly the narrative that many commentators have now taken up
4010430 russia seeks to frustrate americas use of georgia for this purpose and uses abkhazia and south ossetia as daggers pointed at the jugular of the btc pipeline
4010431 when saakashvili sought to drive the russians out of these enclaves the russians struck back
4010432 not the sort of situation where the death penalty is
4010433 there are things in life worth fighting and dying for and one of them is making sure
4010434 it also serves to prove the value of on air call outs and brand building support via purposeful cross promotion from cbs television and cbs radio
4010435 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4010436 three stages or modes of life the aethetic the ethical and the religious
4010437 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4010438 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4010439 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4010440 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4010441 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4010442 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4010443 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4010444 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4010445 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4010446 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4010447 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4010448 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4010449 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4010450 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4010451 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4010452 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4010453 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4010454 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4010455 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4010456 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4010457 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4010458 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4010459 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4010460 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4010461 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4010462 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4010463 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

4010468 youre not gonna believe whats happening on the olympics there are these two girls in bikinis playing volleyball and every time they make a point they pat each other on the ass
4010469 i didnt really have the courage to transition on the job nobody i knew at the time had done it and i didnt anticipate that it would be successful
4010470 maybe something in my behavior or my speech perhaps made them uncomfortable
4010471 it wasnt as if theyd said were going to fire you because youre transgender

4010480 this is the only consumer product that when used as intended kills people
4010481 takes the decisions about what might be in cigarettes away from the tobacco industry and turns them over to the scientists
4010482 fda regulates drugs and devices by approving products after weighing the benefits against the risks of a product
4010483 in contrast there is no such thing as a cigarette in which the benefits outweigh the risks the use of tobacco products is inherently unsafe

4010485 the gallup poll has me and mccain about tied tied i should be killing him but look at the recent numbers me up by a little and then he comes up and then its me again
4010486 if theres a single demographic i should have but dont its white women i beat mccain by almost 10 points with women in general but he beats me with white women by six those are hillarys people

4010489 kennedy picked johnson he hated him but he picked him anyway and they won reagan chose bush they battled each other in the primaries but in the end reagan was big enough to take him i mean sometimes youve got to face reality this is politics
4010490 i mean why not shed be an exciting choice unify the party and all of that shed bring in some of those white women and maybe some of their white husbands as well all the polls say so
4010491 my people would scream bloody murder if i picked hillary theyd say what about change so id say isnt a black man and a white woman on the ticket the ultimate in change
4010492 id better gather my stuff and get out of here cant believe that cloud is following me looks like im in for a real storm

4010495 the residents were so impressed with opio because a lot of people have left uganda
4010496 but few people have ever come back to try and help the people
4010497 theres a lot of little details but essentially what this guy was saying was that no this is my land
4010498 when we got there we immediately said this is just wrong
4010499 we called this the billion dollar well because we essentially said if we cant guarantee the wells we put in investments we make that some government official or somebody isnt going to say im going to take that then we wouldnt come back
4010500 im just trying to help because i used to be part of those kids i used to be like those kids running naked barefooted drinking dirty water i worked my way out of poverty and im in a position now i can look back and see how i can help
4010501 the medication they have today is so phenomenal no more barfing for hours from the chemo
4010502 what i had done was the diep deep inferior epigastric perforator it is similar to the tram flap procedure except the muscles are not compromised but left intact the fat flaps are brought up to the arteries and veins in the chest and then stuffed into the breast cavities im as natural now in the breast area as i was before
4010503 the day prior to surgery they injected a radioactive dye to find any lymph nodes that might be affected and that was the most discomforting part of the whole procedure they traced the dye and removed any nodes that were of concern but luckily only one node of 15 was affected
4010504 guru of breast oncology in north america shes the one that hooked me up with the phenomenal surgical team
4010505 when i lifted my arm and made a fist the breast sort of puckered in one area
4010506 but there was no plastic surgeon here at the time and i wanted the latest procedure in reconstruction so i went to vancouver
4010507 ive been given a gift to dabble in the world of cancer and i think i can help others going down this road
4010508 todays medications are wonderful but people with this disease need to network with family friends and co workers rather than retreating
4010509 dont listen to anything but natural sound dont look at anything you have to turn on this is about the pleasure of silence this is not meditating this is reacquainting yourself with yourself something interesting might enter your head if you let it alone

4010544 natuurlijk kan het kabinet weinig doen aan de olieprijs op de wereldmarkt maar het kan wel de geplande btw verhoging schrappen en de extra gasbaten aanwenden om de koopkracht op peil te houden balkenende heeft genoeg mogelijkheden om zijn beloften na het zuur komt het zoet waar te maken het is echt een kwestie van politieke wil
4010545 het zou niet meer dan logisch zijn om deze extra inkomsten te gebruiken om de gestegen brandstofprijzen op te vangen
4010546 we kunnen een nieuwe heffing invoeren op de winning van gas en olie uit de nederlandse bodem bedrijven als shell en esso maken er miljardenwinsten mee zij kunnen best iets meer bijdragen ten bate van de koopkracht het is niet rechtvaardig als alle lusten naar de multinationals gaan en de lasten naar de burger
4010547 de geplande verhoging van de btw van 19 procent naar 20 procent mag niet doorgaan dat zou leiden tot nog meer koopkrachtverlies terwijl de inflatie al hoog is maar ook het schrappen van de aftrekmogelijkheid voor bijzondere ziektekosten is zon maatregel dat gaat er toe leiden dat juist een kwetsbare groep extra zorgkosten krijgt voor velen wordt dit een regelrechte aanslag op de portemonnee
4010548 in elk geval moeten deze kosten voor gezinnen met een inkomen tot 60 000 euro bevroren worden de toegankelijkheid en betaalbaarheid van kinderopvang moet gegarandeerd blijven

4010556 the appeal against conviction is one that i can deal with if it is purely on a question of law

4010573 just keep this cotton on here for about 20 minutes or so
4010574 its winter and im polish my fair skin comes naturally
4010575 no i dont mean that kind of pale but well see what the doctor says your blood results should be in soon
4010576 doctor neutro phil neutro nice to meet you mr ocyte
4010577 looking at your blood counts it seems that they are below normal now we have to find out why that may be
4010578 alright im employed as a city crew worker i cut grass i tar pot holes i spray weed killer i paint just about everything they tell me to do thats what i do
4010579 thats interesting do you wear any protective gear such as masks gloves respirators are you aware of the chemicals that youre working with before you work with them so that you know how to protect yourself
4010580 well i never really thought it was a big deal we were never instructed that we had to wear any of that stuff
4010581 based on what youre telling me mr ocyte the reason for your counts to be this low could be from your exposure to benzene
4010582 benzene is a chemical that is used in the production of plastics oils and pesticides it has been known as a carcinogen a cancer causing agent
4010583 how long will it take to figure out whats wrong
4010584 well start with a bone marrow biopsy a needle is inserted into your hip bone to pull out some bone marrow we then study the marrow to see whether it is normal or not it will also help us in the process of diagnosing you i would like to do a biopsy now because your counts are very low the sooner we can do this the sooner well know whats wrong and the sooner we can treat you
4010585 well mr ocyte based on our preliminary findings we have determined that you have severe aplastic anemia
4010586 aplastic anemia is a blood disorder that affects the bone marrow which is the blood factory of your body your bone marrow is not making enough red blood cells white blood cells or platelets which would explain your fatigue lingering illness and failure to clot properly from your blood draw we also are confident in saying that based on the work that you do and for the number of years you have worked there your illness was caused by benzene exposure unfortunately because you were not removed from the exposure immediately your bone marrow has been damaged significantly
4010587 i have never heard of this before is it common
4010588 years ago i would say no its not common in the past year we have diagnosed seven different patients with this disorder due to occupational exposures to chemicals such as benzene which is commonly used in pesticides and herbicides we have seen this disease on the rise on the plus side please be aware that research has come a long way and we have been very successful with getting people into remission using different protocols

4010635 russian officials believe that it was the usa that orchestrated the current conflict the chairman of the state duma committee for security vladimir vasilyev believes that the current conflict is south ossetia is very reminiscent to the wars in iraq and kosovo
4010636 spokesmen for the state department and the c i a declined to confirm that mr woodruff was working for the intelligence agency
4010637 georgia was rocked by opposition rallies for six days last november as protesters occupied central tbilisi demanding saakashvilis resignation over allegations of corruption and increasing authoritarianism
4010638 the georgian leader responded by sending in riot police to crack down on protesters on november 7 over 500 people were injured according to human rights watch as police used rubber bullets tear gas and water cannons to break up the demonstrations

4010640 a deadly firefight between georgian troops and separatists in a russian backed breakaway region ahead of rices arrival a senior state department official who did not want to be identified told reporters that unchecked conflict in the region could lead to catastrophe the official also said moscow should realize its soviet empire is gone
4010641 in addition to the spy drones israel has also been supplying georgia with infantry weapons and electronics for artillery systems and has helped upgrade soviet designed su 25 ground attack jets assembled in georgia according to koba liklikadze an independent military expert based in tbilisi former israeli generals also serve as advisers to the georgian military
4010642 darjeelings inclusion in bengal was comparatively recent and only because the british were rulers common to both places historically culturally ethnically socially religiously linguistically there was no affinity whatsoever between bengal and darjeeling
4010643 in laying down the plans for the future the government should aim at the creation of a separate unit comprising of the present darjeeling district with the portion of jalpaiguri district which was annexed from bhutan in 1865
4010644 it appears to us that our case has been somewhat obscured by including the dispatch under
4010645 darjeeling where the gorkha population predominate should be excluded from bengal and treated as an independent administrative unit with the deputy commissioner as the administrator vested with much more powers than that of a district magistrate and assisted by a small executive council representative of all the interests in the administration of the area
4010646 whereas all minority communities in india had received due consideration of their claims your memorialists emphatically urge that the district of darjeeling should be totally excluded from bengal by the creation of an independent administrative unit with an administrator the head of the area assisted by an executive council the area should be placed directly under the central government the governor of bengal acting as the agent to the governor general
4010647 the hill people as a minority in the province under the new constitution have not failed to realize the drawbacks and disadvantages of the present arrangement and they are now apprehensive that their social solidarity and their existence as a community is being threatened with serious disruption owing to various factors coming into play chiefly by the realization by many of them that the hill peoples welfare is now dependent on the exigencies to party politics in the bengal assembly and their utter helplessness to make their voice heard
4010648 the communist party of india demand after making necessary revisions of the existing boundaries the three contiguous areas of darjeeling district southern sikkim and nepal be formed into one single zone to be called gorkhastan
4010649 all along the himalayas in the north and northeast we have on our side of the frontier a population ethnologically and culturally different from tibetans or mongoloids the undefined state of the frontier and existence on our side of a population with its affinities to tibetans or chinese have all the elements of potential trouble between china and ourselves let us consider the political conditions on this potential troublesome frontier our northern or northeastern approaches consists of nepal sikkim darjeeling and the tribal areas of assam the contact of these areas with us is by no means close and intimate the people inhabiting these portions have no established loyalty or devotion to india even darjeeling and kalimpong areas are not free from pro mongoloid prejudices
4010650 the kochayas meches lepchas bhutias nepalis and rajbanshis are the original inhabitants of this district whose customs systems and traditions fundamentally differ from that of the rest of west bengal
4010651 our long felt demand for a separate state gorkhaland be carved out as soon as possible separate state only solution we welcome our people from assam to our own state gorkhaland but not to be deported in other states gorkhaland always salutes to the national and your leadership
4010652 is very much relevant in our demand to get a separate statehood outside west bengal to ensure administrative efficiency and convenience and coordination of economic development and welfare activities for this region
4010653 we demand the formation of the state of darjeeling comprising of the nepali speaking regions north bengal i e the nepali speaking areas of the darjeeling and jalpaiguri districts the darjeeling prant parishad is of the opinion that nothing short of full fledged statehood for darjeeling and no other administrative scheme will ultimately found to be workable
4010654 the demand is an expression of the belief in the best democratic tradition that the right to a state within the indian union is an inalienable right it is therefore not a matter of acceding to the demand condescendingly but giving what is rightfully ours
4010655 a separate state of gorkhaland within the framework of the indian constitution
4010656 the policy of his majestys government is that of the increasing association of indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual development of self governing institutions with a view to the progressive realization of responsible government in india
4010657 that the natural issue of indias constitutional progress is the attainment of dominion status

4010663 i got an awful shock when i went up the bog road this morning and someone told me christy ward was dead

4010665 the wards have a wide circle of family and friends around ballinasloe so its a terrible tragedy for the town

4010691 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better th e credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again because there is no effort without error or shortcoming but who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself for a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat

4010694 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4010695 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4010696 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4010697 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4010698 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4010699 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4010700 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4010701 it happens we see it all the time unfortunately its very sad but there you go if it didnt we wouldnt have a business

4010704 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4010705 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4010706 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4010707 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4010708 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4010709 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4010710 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4010711 y para qu leches quiero yo eso que no lo he usado en mi vida

4010714 i was so calm that i think i could have seen each face in this venue
4010715 itd be pretty light anyway everyones had hard racing this week so youre just trying to recover your last reserves before you hit into it on saturday
4010716 he wont put all that weight back on but he should still race well
4010717 its difficult to see everyone else but theyre going to struggle to see me
4010718 hopefully i can maybe get a slip on the field and they wont know what im up to
4010719 if you get a lead its a big advantage but if youre fighting it out at the finish you might not be in touch with what everyone else is doing
4010720 all six crews in the final have shown good speed right throughout the season at various times
4010721 i dont think youre going to get an arrow formation going down the course it could be a blanket race for a long time
4010722 its better to be in the outside lane than not be there
4010723 all i want to do is finish off the great work that pat started
4010724 the messages are not going to be any different just a different voice
4010725 theres rugby decisions and financial decisions but from a rugby decision it is disappointing
4010726 a pretty good indication that multistate commercial traffic and regional vacation travel are down
4010727 the effects of that may be digging deeper in rural areas
4010728 people in the middle of the country may just be staying home
4010729 summer travel is down a little bit but in smaller communities its down more significantly they have less disposable income so higher gas prices affect them disproportionately it just comes down to having less money to spend so you stay home
4010730 not only is it expensive to get anywhere but you have to pay more for whatever you do when you get there
4010731 if i could have gotten a bus ticket that was even cheaper but the buses were all full
4010732 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
4010733 i think there are too many negatives and the negatives are too large for a gasoline price decline to change the story significantly
4010734 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4010735 the retailer will make its largest investment yet in the country since it started operating in brazil fourteen years ago
4010736 i would never give it up not unless i was dying of alcohol poisoning or something
4010737 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned
4010738 so far theres signs that they are holding up although theres still concern that these industries will see some impact
4010739 id rather spend 4 or 5 on quality beer than 3 on hopped up water
4010740 its worth the extra buck or two to get quality
4010741 cigarettes in general can withstand such an environment better than many consumer products
4010742 the odd bar of chocolate is not going to break the bank
4010743 i always have a piece a day and i cant see that changing
4010744 its the first bright news for traders in the oil market in a while
4010745 the dramatic drop off in commodities and specifically oil has been well overdone in my view
4010746 they still think the u s is the epicenter of the world economy
4010747 the u s is still very important but as far as commodity demand is concerned the u s isnt the main game in town china is the biggest consumer and increasingly india
4010748 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
4010749 could start to stabilize as early as the first quarter of next year if the government program gains any traction
4010750 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
4010751 could start to stabilize as early as the first quarter of next year if the government program gains any traction
4010752 potentially yield very large rewards with no capital investment and little risk
4010753 im really not a chicken little player but i worry that no one seems to be focusing in on this
4010754 the level of excess capacity has shrunk down in the last few years to a level barely within the planning toleration of the industry
4010755 were to the point where we need every possible resource renewables demand response and energy efficiency nuclear clean coal you name it we need it
4010756 and we especially need the transmission lines that will bring the power generated by these new resources to consumers
4010757 if you dont have generation and transmission something has to give
4010758 the event was a major crisis and did probably force something to happen that would have otherwise not happened
4010759 its easy to take the power infrastructure for granted until something goes wrong
4010760 the weakening korean won continues to trigger additional air cargo demand from korean exporters
4010761 microsoft has a valid lease at the building that was negotiated in good faith and looks forward to expanding its strong r amp d presence in cambridge
4010762 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
4010763 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
4010764 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
4010765 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
4010766 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
4010767 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
4010768 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem

4010772 the words person human being child and individual include every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development
4010773 there was some suggestion that we might be able to craft something that might meet constitutional muster with respect to caring for fetuses or children who were delivered in this fashion unfortunately this bill goes a little bit further and so this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny number one whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a a child a nine month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place i mean it it would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
4010774 caring for fetuses or children who were delivered in this fashion
4010775 of course we believe everyone born should deserve the protections of this bill
4010776 who could be more vulnerable than a newborn baby so of course we agree with that we join with an aye vote on this i hope it will in fact be unanimous

4010782 when the dust settles i am sure that we will help this sovereign nation and ally rebuild its military
4010783 its never zero risk but i think it will be ok
4010784 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community

4010800 sometimes people just arent who you need them to be at like a certain moment and unfortunately theres nothing you can do about it
4010801 seriously i had a fantastic time tonight u r a really cool chick and absolutely beautiful i definitely hope to see u again really soon
4010802 not interested i dont think you are right for me too old i dont think so
4010803 two hundred years ago when people lived in villages or very dense cities everyones behavior was evident to many and it was extremely hard to hide it
4010804 weve been shaped to be very sensitive to each other on a face to face basis
4010805 when people post to blogs they may be thinking im not going to worry too much about who the target of my revelation might be im just going to go ahead and let go
4010806 hairdressers bartenders and strangers on a train have long been recipients of anonymous confessions but theyre also participants who keep you from getting too lost in your head or revealing too much
4010807 the big problem as i saw it was using e mails since those could get forwarded
4010808 i thought my blog was a more private way to share stuff
4010809 i dont get mad when women like black guys or young guys or buff guys its their preference
4010810 i thought do i want everyone to know the deep recesses of my sexuality my parents all that stuff the fear was that then people would judge me that perhaps they wouldnt like me but i didnt want to act out of fear so i asked myself is there a positive reason to do this and that would be connecting to people who appreciate me expressing myself and revealing my weaknesses
4010811 more and more people believe they are entitled to behave according to their own values and not the norms prevailing in society
4010812 im single i can date as many people as i want apologizing for that would be stupid
4010813 ive always thought of myself as being in a movie that my world is larger than life
4010814 theres a way in which our lives seem valid only if they obtain some veneer of media recognition
4010815 you now have a story and perhaps youve even become the focus of other watchers and listeners
4010816 you become a character a speaking part in the larger theater of society
4010817 i wonder why i am not an antihero maybe its because other people purely play the schlub whereas i claim my successes as well as my weaknesses i embrace both
4010818 its like some sort of love affair stripped of the courtship phase i feel bathed in safety
4010819 its almost as though theres a little corner of the mind thats looking for the very thing youre trying not to think about
4010820 when people write about secrets they report feeling better they acknowledge the events and can organize them
4010821 if youre writing and you know lots of people are going to be looking at it youre going to change things to make yourself look good
4010822 there was so much going on in my head and i felt really alone
4010823 sometimes i wake up on a weekend morning and im really depressed but cant explain why
4010824 so ill sit down and post about whats going on in my head
4010825 writing things down and getting reactions is a start but i dont think its an end point
4010826 you need a sustained reaction from a concerned and involved listener so that the story doesnt just end but keeps getting written the two of you write it together
4010827 its the sort of thing where you see things happening and you can feel detached where you think i cant wait to tell my friends about this maybe its a weird coping mechanism
4010828 humiliation and anguish beyond that which any reasonable person should be expected to bear in a decent and civilized society
4010829 i got the sense she was trying to tell me where her master was
4010830 wed been looking for my husband for six weeks but this isnt how we wanted it to end however at least we can close this now
4010831 obviously in terms of value of money i want to look at the whole lecturing profile i want to make sure that the senior people in our universities who are the most professional who have the greatest experience and who can make a valuable contribution to students are actually in the classroom from time to time
4010832 they the colleges and universities are saying that they do not have adequate funds but i am looking at exactly what funds we have put into the third level sector
4010833 we have already increased funding by 25pc in three years that is an outstanding achievement but people have been critical of the hse and the amount of funding that has been put into the hse and have questioned exactly what has been attained from that funding
4010834 i as minister want to carry out an audit on the third level sector and i am going to have a look at a number of the institutions and to see how they are performing how the money is targeted and if we are getting the benefits from it
4010835 i also want to see that money is targeted towards students student services and social inclusion
4010836 strong and well positioned to take advantage of future opportunities
4010837 this strategic cost cutting exercise will ensure a stable business model which will allow us to expand relatively rapidly when the market returns to normal
4010838 the intention going forward is to preserve as many jobs as possible to maintain the skills we will need in the future
4010839 my husband takes his lunch to work and we all eat a lot of sandwiches here
4010840 there are things we can do to drive less but how do you eat less you dont
4010841 over the years retailers realized that store brands were not just something to be floated out during hard times
4010842 all of us are creatures of habit and when things are going well you just buy what you bought last week
4010843 customers are much more willing to try a corporate brand when the economy gets tough and when we can get the customer to try it they like it it just makes it so much easier for us to get the customer to try it
4010844 just because its a store brand doesnt mean its not the best for your family
4010845 i did feel for a long period that there wasnt anything new to buy
4010846 but i really like the slim fit its not so roomy not so bulky and its a lot cleaner
4010847 this is a trend that you have to buy otherwise you look outdated
4010848 suddenly a pair of cargo pants and a polo shirt doesnt look good anymore
4010849 by offering too many options and with everything a trend it is very easy not to buy anything
4010850 if you are keeping up with fashion people notice and it gives them more confidence
4010851 i had looked in the mirror and never was impressed i looked like a little kid who was waiting to grow into his clothes
4010852 i feel extremely confident in the way i look everyone has noticed
4010853 since the beginning of the year we have launched dozens of programs and products that have the potential to make a meaningful impact on our future and we have made significant progress in aligning our expenses with the realities of an industry in recession
4010854 we believe there is growing pent up demand from those who have postponed buying during the past almost three years
4010855 an incentive to new customers to move off the fence and become first time buyers
4010856 it became a really big thing and every kid wanted a pair of heelys
4010857 but they over distributed it and expectations got too high and eventually they kind of crashed
4010858 we believe acceptance of this proposal is in the best interests of heelys and its stockholders
4010859 we are excited about the prospects that the combined company would hold
4010860 johnson asked me if i was upset with her when she made a mistake at worlds the 2007 world championships
4010861 i said no and she said its the same now
4010862 no matter what shes our team leader and team mom mistakes or not shes still part of team usa
4010863 alicia they tried to break your focus and you let them
4010864 in my opinion it was an attempt to break her concentration and that is what happened
4010865 the relationship i have with ken armstrong is like none other hes a true father figure
4010866 its so special that i can be here with him its been a long journey with a lot of ups and downs but if not for the journey the moment wouldnt be special
4010867 football is sheer will give it all youve got hold nothing back
4010868 you have to do that in diving but you have to be able to harness that adrenaline and produce something that is graceful and controlled and beautiful
4010869 ever since i was younger ive had a knack for performing better in competition than in practice
4010870 its the joy of performing it just helps me to be sharper in my actions
4010871 he brown called me and said olen you need to spend some money
4010872 i asked why and he said the girls had talent and could be really good divers with the right people he said we should get with kenny at the woodlands and thats how they started
4010873 she had the stick to itiveness and the desire to do it
4010874 i loved diving and i wanted to show everyone that people can go through adverse times and come out successfully
4010875 shes always been a great competitor right from day one
4010876 but she trains like a doughnut she would come in la la la la la and then in the meet she would turn into the hulk if i could get that out of her in a workout no one would touch her
4010877 both have a strong belief in their own ability and both have the ability to inspire
4010878 they didnt dictate they encouraged coach royal could convince an athlete he could play better than he could and kenny has that ability to make you believe in yourself
4010879 the first time we saw foster work out everybody knew she was going to be something special
4010880 i pulled her over and said the university of texas is going to regret the day that you did not go to their school
4010881 i would not be the athlete the diver the person that i am without kenny
4010882 hes given me the ability to enjoy competing ive known laura since i was a little girl our relationship has changed from role model to peer and i look forward to being at the olympics with her
4010883 i think she has potential to win the gold medal
4010884 we have this fine european sports car but it has a brain of its own so as a mechanic i have to fine tune things and she has to be receptive and then were there
4010885 in this sport you compete against the dive and thats all you can control i can only do my dives but i want to do them the best i can and that is what excites me
4010886 nous avons tourn dans des environnements tr s diff rents soucieux de leur offrir de belles images voire des cartes postales les fans des experts verront miami et las vegas sous un autre jour a nous de les divertir gr ce un savoureux m lange de jobs tonnants et une visite guid e travers quatre etats magnifiques
4010887 inutile de vous dire que je n tais pas forc ment tr s laise
4010888 niea is frustrated that to date we have not been able to identify who was responsible for releasing the pollutant into the river which caused this fish kill
4010889 while samples have been collected and analysed and a vast range of substances have been identified it is still not clear what actually caused this pollution incident
4010890 this incident has caused great distress to the local community including anglers using the river
4010891 however someone knows who was responsible i would therefore urge anyone whether they are at tonights meeting or not to come forward with any information they might have which can help the agency to identify the offender
4010892 the dispute is politically motivated bob crow wants tube lines trashed we cant be held to ransom by a militant union
4010893 desmond llewellyn who played the inventor q was a great friend i have got some of the great iconic pieces from the films including some of the q gadgets
4010894 i think i have the best bond collection in the world this scheme could have a huge beneficial effect for keswick
4010895 i want to make it different there is so much science involved in the bond stories
4010896 bond is synonymous with fitness and sports like judo karate and fencing so we will be able to put on displays by experts and bring in stunt men to develop the adventure theme
4010897 i think this will be a great thing for keswick and i can envisage it leading to other events and maybe a james bond convention because the book and films are so popular
4010898 the real icing on the cake would be if we could persuade the film makers to come to the area when they make the next bond movie
4010899 i want to engage with young people and use the building in the evenings

4010901 the horse is prepared for the day of battle but the victory belongs to the lord
4010902 some of the plans they are making will have a major impact on the lives of thousands of people who live in the area
4010903 im involved because as one of the churches here in the delta were very concerned about our members and the whole community
4010904 i think the peripheral canal will be a disaster for the delta long term and im going to fight them
4010905 im presenting that as the view that i think other people should hold
4010906 theyre trying to put out a rational plan that doesnt hurt agriculture and restores some of the fish habitat weve lost i dont see anything wrong in that
4010907 weve got people in the delta who farm they fish they play and they need to be included
4010908 its rather presumptuous that this thing is moving as rapidly as it is
4010909 i hope people dont accept it and dont allow them on their property
4010910 we had a bad shooting day both teams were tired and sluggish on their shots
4010911 flipped his cell phone shut and acted as if he was using an electric shaver while driving
4010912 people will think of just about anything to try to get out of a ticket
4010913 our job is to hack our way through the excuses and enforce the laws
4010914 i havent figured out how to use my bluetooth yet
4010915 my wife said i sounded like i was in a toilet so i switched back to cell
4010916 i was waiting to get a ticket before i spend money on a bluetooth
4010917 the fine is just a business expense ill write it off
4010918 is it not more of a hazard to fumble around trying to get the ear thing in
4010919 the united states and the world expect russia to honor that commitment
4010920 i specially checked it with the general staff of the russian armed forces there are no russian servicemen supporting the peacekeeping operation in georgia in poti
4010921 we are not making any secret of that they are staying there to neutralize the large arsenal of weapons and other military hardware in the areas of gori and senaki these arsenals remain unguarded apparently those who guarded them fled
4010922 aimed at ensuring the peace enforcement operation in respect to the georgian side which violates all of its obligations
4010923 with the purpose of demilitarizing the zone adjacent to the conflict area and also guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population russian peacekeepers are evacuating this hardware vehicles and ammunition
4010924 we believe the russians are consolidating their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia and will not significantly expand their ground presence in georgia
4010925 we believe the russians will fall back to their pre crisis boundaries we do expect russia to retain a military presence in both enclaves for the long term
4010926 we do see a halt to offensive military operations if there is a formal cease fire we believe the russians will adhere to it while reserving the right to use military force to respond to threats against their troops
4010927 russian tanks continue to ravage georgia town and villages killing people destroying buildings looting theyve been doing worst things to what ive heard in the past and i could never imagine happening in my country
4010928 the civilian population should be protected against all encroachments on their lives and dignity
4010929 but i feel very confident that shell be talking about the middle class the squeeze thats on the middle class now that people are feeling this in very difficult ways and the way the obama approach is the most meaningful way to get out and solve these issues
4010930 i think its going to come down to who he feels comfortable with
4010931 the criteria that he uses i think are going to be who he thinks can step into the presidency should he be for some reason unable to serve
4010932 who matches well with his policies with his values and who he can govern with
4010933 we do not know or understand clearly why we were denied because reasons were not provided
4010934 its very disturbing and upsetting to us to be where we are
4010935 because of confidentiality im not able to comment on the specific reasons why they commonwealth were denied
4010936 we have reviewed 240 agencies more in fact and of that number 18 have been denied

4010938 what animal youve always wanted to see but havent for whatever reason
4010939 they are so easy and adjustable they contain all blowouts and are super absorbent
4010940 disposable diapers are the third largest single consumer item in landfills and represent about 4 of solid waste in a house with a child in diapers disposables make up 50 of household waste
4010941 i cant think of a better way to give going green a chance than adding super cute and soft cloth diapers to my babys wardrobe
4010942 theyre just so cute and i feel better about my small contributions to a greener earth and my son likes his contributions to a rash free heinie once i started putting him in cloth i knew i was never going back to disposables
4010943 they are so easy and adjustable they contain all blowouts and are super absorbent
4010944 all the vendors are out of stock all the suppliers who sell the stuff to the vendors are out of stock its huge and its not shrinking
4010945 they are so easy and adjustable they contain all blowouts and are super absorbent
4010946 if someone were to load all of the disposable wipes purchased by consumers in north america last year onto 18 wheel semis the caravan would number 9 000 trucks and stretch for 68 miles and it would be carrying 83 000 tons of these seemingly ephemeral cloths which are anything but fleeting
4010947 thicker than toilet paper the wipes do not disintegrate when flushed as their use has become more prevalent the wipes are clogging treatment plant pumps and costing communities extra money in overtime and equipment repairs
4010948 they are so easy and adjustable they contain all blowouts and are super absorbent
4010949 they are so easy and adjustable they contain all blowouts and are super absorbent
4010950 the bottom line environmentally is that there is no significant difference between cloth and disposable diapers when you consider the materials water energy and transportation costs to produce and maintain the diapers its a wash
4010951 life cycle assessment of disposable and reusable nappies in the uk
4010952 for the three nappy systems studied disposables home laundered and commercially laundered there was no significant difference between any of the environmental impacts that is overall no system clearly had a better or worse environmental performance although the life cycle stages that are the main source for these impacts are different for each system
4010953 over 2 000 parents using disposable nappies were surveyed by contrast most of the survey results for reusable nappies were drawn from a sample of 117 parents further reduced to 32 because users of terry towelling nappies were relied on for most assumptions this resulted in as few as two respondents being used for certain key assumptions
4010954 study shows careful laundering can reduce environmental impact even using the studys self acknowledged weak assumptions the conclusion does not reflect the significant reduction of environmental impact resulting from use of energy efficient washing as shown within the body of the report the report shows that users of home laundered cloth diapers can reduce environmental impact up to 38 through their laundering choices energy rating washing temperature and number of diapers laundered have a significant impact on the numbers
4010955 they are so easy and adjustable they contain all blowouts and are super absorbent
4010956 i really want to cloth diaper full time but thats a lot more money than i want to spend
4010957 they are so easy and adjustable they contain all blowouts and are super absorbent
4010958 its something that a lot of people already do and therefore a lot of people already know the value of the product
4010959 and therefore a lot of people already know the value of the product
4010960 its the only bottle of water that you can carry with one finger
4010961 we looked at it with our store managers and also our executive management and everybody said wow how come we havent done this before
4010962 said bob mahlstede president of the catalina mart convenience chain which stocks fria in 12 of its 18 stores
4010963 that was the a ha thing was our convenience customers dont plan ahead
4010964 if it works its a good idea usually when im thirsty im going to drink a whole bottle
4010965 it was already frozen i didnt have to wait for it at the house
4010966 we want to carry as much as we can locally to support the local economy and local businesspeople
4010967 everyone weve approached about selling the product has agreed to take it on
4010968 im not a slam dunk type of guy sorry im getting older
4010969 we wouldve been already thrown out of the olympics if it were team usa at least we wouldnt have been able to come back to the u s there would be suspensions
4010970 they wont do anything to them its a double standard
4010971 we look at our team going forward our two best post players are up there in age rasheed and dyess
4010972 we have a good group of young post players coming along with jason maxiell amir johnson cheikh samb and trent plaisted but we didnt have anybody with massive size looking for a young player like that most of the time its very difficult to get kwame has had some ups and downs in his career but i still look at kwame as a young big guy who can play and do well in this league another 10 years or so

4010990 i let it happen on its own if you get out of the way and let the spirit move through you all kinds of wonderful wonderful surprises will happen
4010991 there was a hell of a lot of shark out there and wed bring in 1 000 or 2 000 of them a day our whole boat filled with so many of them that the water line was as high as the bow some people would fall down from the smell when we came into the harbor
4010992 it took about two or two and a half years but we cleaned them all out
4010993 every summer there are going to be shark attacks somewhere in the world no matter what eventually it will be at a beach near you
4010994 the ocean is a sharks native habitat they can show up anywhere at any time
4010995 even if it had happened on the steps of the hospital i dont think we could have saved him
4010996 but we were skeptical of it he showed us a fin that he said was bit but it looked perfect
4010997 huge stainless steel hook and a big hunk of fish on it
4010998 after seeing that i was like okay im not going diving today
4010999 with me in its mouth the shark thrust me totally out of the water i remember looking down on the boat
4011000 i hadnt been in the water for more than two minutes when all of a sudden the ocean just erupted underneath me
4011001 with me in its mouth the shark thrust me totally out of the water i remember looking down on the boat
4011002 it looked like meat hanging in a butcher shop when i looked down into it
4011003 it was a gentle mouthing really for such a big thing like that
4011004 it was crazy there were tv crews on my lawn when i woke up the next morning literally i was front page news around the world

4011013 open minded but ummm english is our national language learn it
4011014 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4011015 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4011016 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
4011017 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
4011018 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
4011019 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
4011020 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
4011021 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
4011022 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field

4011031 it turns out that in the photo shoot for the submission of our team one of our sponsors asked us to make as a wink to our participation in beijing an expression of eastern eyes we felt it was something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture

4011037 the illinois senate rejected a 7 5 percent pay increase tuesday in the face of withering criticism from voters who feared lawmakers would sneak the raises through after they were safely re elected in november

4011039 blagojevich summoned lawmakers to the capitol specifically to debate education funding but without any legislation to consider the house adjourned after 21 minutes and the senate mostly met privately

4011047 the idea of providing 8 billion for state of the art healthcare for murderers like charles ng richard allen davis and scott peterson is sheer lunacy
4011048 i think he has to be a part of the team and he cant be floating out there by himself because otherwise everyone would be out there trying to derail him
4011049 will continue to work cooperatively with the receiver and the legislature to move forward in a fiscally responsible way to provide the necessary funding for the receivers efforts
4011050 because of their courage they were able to take what was a horrific experience and emerge from it as victors

4011052 it made me worry and want to stay inside and just wait for my three year contract to end
4011053 it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax
4011054 just because a bill comes to the floor with offshore and energy in the title doesnt mean its a good offshore drilling bill
4011055 speaker pelosi is only going to schedule a vote on an offshore energy bill if she believes it would be politically perilous not to and even then its not going to have much energy in it
4011056 and ill bet you when members come back from their districts youll find more movement taking place
4011057 its nonsensical that its safe to drill off the coast of texas and louisiana and mississippi and yes california but its not safe to drill anywhere else the average hardworking american doesnt understand that
4011058 always concerned about the push for more drilling off our coasts from the oil industry and its supporters
4011059 a huge erosion of support for the moratorium among democrats
4011060 whatever crosses their path they are attacking and destroying it
4011061 they were shaking they said were hungry and we fed them
4011062 they were scared to death they didnt even have water we gave them tomatoes cucumbers bread and fruit
4011063 there is no government no ambulances no electricity nothing let the russians come in and that will be the end
4011064 we are not able to resist them if somebody doesnt help us
4011065 we are just praying for these people who are staying here
4011066 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4011067 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4011068 our focus right now is on delivering humanitarian aid and taking care of the immediate needs of those who are caught in this conflict
4011069 when the dust settles i am sure that we will help this sovereign nation and ally rebuild its military
4011070 its never zero risk but i think it will be ok
4011071 torajans are very sensitive about this because the funeral is our last honor
4011072 we have to wait until the whole family is ready
4011073 for instance theres me and my siblings perhaps i am able to contribute a number of buffaloes while my siblings still have to wait and save some money we all have to agree because for this funeral the number were talking about isnt small

4011082 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
4011083 we have a responsibility to face the whole country and to be open with this explanation it is a question of national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture

4011086 pass on knowledge from me even if it is only one verse
4011087 once you have decided what it right and committed yourself not matter the cost no matter the opposition there is no other way
4011088 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4011089 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4011090 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4011091 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4011092 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4011093 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4011094 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4011095 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4011096 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4011097 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4011098 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4011099 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4011100 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4011101 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4011102 the personal behavior problems were the direct cause of their defeat
4011103 i dont think philosophy party loyalty or anything of that nature came into this both elections were based completely on personal character as revealed through behavior
4011104 while substance is incredibly important style is important too and you cant separate the two
4011105 how an incumbent responds to a troubling situation is as revealing as the situation itself
4011106 for bruce and newsome the response served to underscore the underlying behavior as opposed to mitigating it
4011107 and vowed that it would never take place again i disagreed with a lot of what was reported but i did not make that the centerpiece of what i was running on

4011109 i trust the voters i believe in the voters the voters made their decision they put me in office and now they want to give someone else a chance
4011110 i think that he brought a lot onto himself but i think that it was overemphasized in the press he had a reputation of being disruptive and it was hard to live down because he got tagged with that regardless of whether things were all his fault or not theres always two sides to the story
4011111 its just a nice easy program for people to participate in and it is time to get it down there
4011112 its just much more convenient and quicker and takes the burden of separating off the person who is disposing the trash
4011113 if were drawing in more recycling volume absolutely its good for business and the environment were wanting to drive diversion without a doubt and it will
4011114 we ship every month it behooves us to move it some months are better than others the last thing i will ever do is send the message that yeah well take it and i dont have a market for it
4011115 weve been calling waste management twice a day every day since the middle of last week trying to get an answer and we havent gotten it yet

4011126 nothing can be more contrary to religion and the clergy than reason and common sense
4011127 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology
4011128 the easy confidence with which i know another mans religion is folly teaches me to suspect that my own is also
4011129 the day will come when the mystical generation of jesus will be classed with the fable of the generation of minerva in the brain of jupiter
4011130 it was a really vicious violent assault that obviously involved a huge amount of rage
4011131 theyve only just made their fire real entry to the scene
4011132 before we can even address the cause we need to find out where the explosion originated
4011133 typically what happens is you work from the are of least damage and move your way into the area of greatest damage in this case here were talking about that whole area being the greatest area of damage
4011134 the fact that there were so many subsequent explosions is obviously complicating things for our people
4011135 for a single fibre or a single exposure to cause asbestos illnesses is quite speculative and really not provable
4011136 if it were my child i would not be worried because we know the exposure is exceedingly low
4011137 i do not want to dwell on politics but let me just say that the incident in north cotabato was a result of the incursions of this group under umbra kato
4011138 i dont think we have anything to do with the issue of federalism
4011139 i dont think umbra kato has any idea what the cha cha charter change is all about
4011140 the next task would be to support the rdcc regional disaster coordinating council in the handling of the idp internally displaced persons
4011141 the relief and rehabilitation process might take longer than the security operations
4011142 i dont stand a ghost of a chance with you
4011143 its sophisticated progressive music thats driven by a rocknroll feel but i really think that my music sometimes slips from those definitions and creates a new entity the main influences range from the progressive rock groups of the seventies such as yes rush pink floyd deep purple and king crimson to newer metal bands like metallica megadeth porcupine tree dream theater and many more
4011144 the mediterranean and ethnic characters that this country holds are alive and well in my music whether i like it or not
4011145 i think the contrast of a european country mixed with an ethnic one thats the way i see israel is exactly whats happening on this album its not a bad thing its one of the things that make the music original and special
4011146 before the first note was composed for this album i knew i wanted daniel to be on it
4011147 apart from being a very talented musician and gifted vocalist i think that hes something very unique in the progressive genre and to me symbolizes the endless possibilities of the progressive genre to evolve it was great working with him and i think he adds a new aspect to the album he did a great job writing the lyrics for his song and of course recording the vocals
4011148 this match was initially suggested by steven wilson who suggested that i should listen to her band paatos and consider adding her to the project so i did and it was love at first listen she has a unique voice and feel that i just had to have on this album after hearing her voice i wrote haze in less than five minutes inspired by the collaboration that could be our collaboration was so successful that petronella added her voice to a second song real along with the main vocalist lior seker
4011149 not long after he got back to me and was very excited about what he had heard wanting to meet me in tel aviv steven offered to mix and master the album his mix makes the album what it is he understands music and knows how to handle it to get it where it belongs
4011150 when it came down to remixing fania tracks we knew wed have to hold out until we had a star line up of contemporary artists
4011151 as an artist it was a tall order to work with tracks that mean so much to fania fans worldwide
4011152 i hope that weve been able to enhance the fania catalog with our individual takes on each of these tunes
4011153 i dont know hes never been a friend to our cause
4011154 but we need that oni and we need him soon
4011155 but he doesnt even have his metal staff yet what use will he be
4011156 he will find it soon enough and when he does he will be able to lead us back into our domain
4011157 ive been wondering what will you do when we get beyond the door
4011158 good stick with the plan i outlined earlier remember we need the oni
4011159 we appreciate and marvel at the bravery and sacrifice our military personnel exhibit daily
4011160 anything we can do to support them and honor them is a top priority
4011161 they bundled me out of the park they forced me to the floor dragged me manhandled me into a restaurant next door

4011166 nobody has seen this evidence theyre just talking about is as if its real
4011167 we are talking about a woman who is brilliant who is fanatical and a potential killer and who was clearly fantasizing about landmarks in
4011168 she shows that the danger is broader than the image we have of terrorists uneducated males with a lot of time on their hands
4011169 everything is so contrived thats why i think it was a setup
4011170 i think they meant to kill her with a bag of stuff on her but it went wrong somehow
4011171 we understand that the present georgian leadership has been a special us project
4011172 but one day washington will have to choose between defending its prestige through a virtual project or an authentic partnership
4011173 the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia must be respected
4011174 we are witnessing a new stage of a full blown russian invasion and aggression against my country
4011175 a big crowd gathered around but i didnt even notice because i was in complete shock
4011176 it took two people to lift it out of the water
4011177 i ended up talking to fish and game and they gave me a form to fill out
4011178 i wish ualat luck and im anxious to see his application
4011179 i dont know if the record is going to go through or not

4011182 we were on our way to pick up the producer neo the matrix listening to cassidy music he was freestyling we were having a good time
4011183 we were on manhattan avenue in jersey city and there comes a truck im talking to cassidy and we hear the driver say oh sh a truck
4011184 it was a commercial truck the size of a large u haul truck this truck runs the red light out of nowhere crosses the intersection outta control and crashes into the left side of our suv vehicle hitting from the back of the driver on down cassidy was seated directly behind the driver so he got the full blunt force impact
4011185 thats why he has a fractured skull and broken bones in his face he was thrown from his seat
4011186 i was bleeding all over myself i jumped out the car and saw him laying there i picked him up there was no life no movement in his body i put him on the seat and immediately called 911 i was feeling panic feeling nervous but im a spiritual man and god put calm over my body
4011187 he started choking on his blood and vomit and i turned him on his side so he wouldnt choke
4011188 fortunately enough he is living god allowed all four of us to live
4011189 hes no angel but since hes been out of prison hes been living the life of a god fearing man and fully trying to live that lifestyle out
4011190 hes been focused with his family his son his fiancee hes not even out there like that hes been in the studio working trying to finish out this album
4011191 this album was showing his growth and development showing creativity
4011192 its gonna be an album that people would love to hear
4011193 hes not on his punch lines as much but hes still witty and clever hes developing into that next artist he has collaborations everything is real clever from john legend to krayzie bone to eve theres a couple of other surprises on there he dug real deep and gave more of himself
4011194 cass is like my brother and this has been such a rough year for him were all praying and staying positive during this time thanks to everyone for their continued support and please keep cassidy and his family in your prayers
4011195 although he didnt start the problem he may have helped to escalate the situation because of his access to the ammunition
4011196 all those guns thats why desmond is gone now because of all those guns
4011197 obviously hes happy to know that hes going to be released from prison soon and can get back to recording and spending time with his family its been a difficult seven months for him
4011198 i got myself together when i heard the gunshots i ducked behind a car
4011199 forever i cant give an exact time frame but it seemed like a long time
4011200 this is my command and you can see the wisdom behind it as long as im king no traitor is going to be honored with the loyal man
4011201 unfortunately as you know his two sons the princes eteocles and polyneices have killed each other in battle and i as the next in blood i have succeeded to the full power of the throne

4011209 this article presents an algorithm to automatically determine the most appropriate reviewers for a manuscript by way of a co authorship network data structure and a relative rank particle swarm algorithm
4011210 ive used a kludge to fix the problems temporarily for this post but over the long run its not a workable solution
4011211 what we need to get out of this is not a formula for avoiding failure but a bunch of anecdotes on how we can minimize the impacts of failure in order to fail over and over and over again
4011212 does that mean we should always focus on the short term goals not at all the luxury of time is exactly that but having this luxury can also buy you a strategic advantage you can trade short term goals for a higher return in the long term
4011213 we all make mistakes the best of us learn from them the best of the best help others learn from their mistakes these can be business failures these can be life failures we want your fail

4011224 imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge thats our commitment
4011225 you know what i just happen to have some shoes im looking to sell
4011226 what tacit knowledge do scientists currently have that they dont explicitly share
4011227 i dont think youll ever see people meeting strangers in chat rooms and working together at least not on a large scale the stakes are too high
4011228 you michael comment that the reason more scientists arent writing wikipedia articles is
4011229 to me this is just replacing the current publishing hierarchy with a self elected hierarchy one that seems more interested in enforcing rules than in creating quality content
4011230 i dont know its fairly easy to filter a lot of those pages out along the same lines that we use to filter spam e mails its not so easy to do the same with scientific papers can you automatically filter for significance or originality and also google rankings are a popularity based system who links to who as one example again i worry that we should be striving for quality papers not for papers written by people who network well or have lots of friends
4011231 two challenging tasks must be achieved 1 build superb online tools and 2 cause the cultural changes necessary for those tools to be accepted the necessity of accomplishing both these tasks is obvious
4011232 let me turn the question around are you aware of any substantial progress that came from blog discussions
4011233 to create an open scientific culture that embraces new online tools two challenging tasks must be achieved 1 build superb online tools and 2 cause the cultural changes necessary for those tools to be accepted
4011234 six questions to ask before setting up a scientific collaboration
4011235 the latest figures demonstrate that the uk is increasingly the gateway to the whole of europe and the most important centre for the private equity industry outside the u s
4011236 in many cases these clients have had first hand experience of private equity having disposed of their own business which was backed via this route because of our open architecture approach we also look at other ways to source private equity we have a tremendous network of clients who are themselves entrepreneurs that frequently offers access to good deals
4011237 private equity consists of investors and funds that make investments directly into private companies or conduct buyouts of public companies that result in a delisting of public equity capital for private equity is raised from retail and institutional investors and can be used to fund new technologies expand working capital within an owned company make acquisitions or to strengthen a balance sheet

4011247 what do you want me to treat you like a princess
4011248 i cant tell you how white bread sweet he was
4011249 it makes you think about what your life would have been like if you stayed with that person
4011250 i mean im glad im not with him but im even gladder if he doesnt own half of new york city or have pictures of him on his 200 foot yacht on his myspace page you know what i mean
4011251 to prove it wasnt that bad after all see everyone recovered

4011257 the difference is huge and once youve opened up your palate to loose tea its hard to go back to bags
4011258 nobody wants to be taught about tea or anything else at a restaurant

4011266 imam malik pernah ditanya tentang kelompok qadariyah siapakah mereka itu
4011267 mereka adalah orang orang yang mengatakan bahwa allah itu tidak menciptakan maksiat
4011268 mereka adalah orang orang yang berpendapat bahwa manusia itu mempunyai kemampuan apabila mereka mau mereka dapat menjadi orang orang taat atau menjadi orang orang durhaka
4011269 saya mendengar imam malik bin anas ditanya tentang menikah dengan seorang penganut paham qadariyah kata beliau seraya membaca ayat
4011270 seorang hamba saya yang beriman lebih baik daripada seorang musryik
4011271 kesaksian penganut paham qadariyah yang menyebarkan pahamnya yang bidah itu tidak dapat dibenarkan begitu pula penganut golongan khawarij dan pengahum paham rafidhah syiah

4011274 over the next several months were going to work very closely together to reconcile that 377 million
4011275 we are talking about converting a military base into a great metropolitan park
4011276 thats an extraordinary restoration project and the notion that there are any absolute numbers that would be unchangeable in the evolution of this project is sort of absurd
4011277 has allowed the design studio to design creatively without the constraints of a maximum budget for the construction of the great park
4011278 at this time so many soft costs have been expended rather than really for the construction of the park
4011279 reassured by the fact that the two numbers are relatively close
4011280 it brings us together as a group kind of like therapy to see something growing and flourishing

4011285 the fetus and newborns are at the most unprotected stages of their lives once the harm occurs it never can be undone
4011286 is a federal regulatory system that is completely incapable of dealing with chemicals that generate huge amounts of income for very powerful lobbying groups
4011287 it has been up to the states and individuals using civil litigation to deal with these situations
4011288 let scientists do the work instead of politicians looking for sexy issues

4011309 we have said from the beginning that the debate should be held in the second half of the campaign after the olympics
4011310 the liberal party havent wanted to have a debate in the first week or two because they havent got any policies
4011311 its very disturbing to note that the minister has yet to comment on the matter although so much has transpired

4011317 the skulls were found plastered that is to say sculpted which is a phenomenon that is identified with the new stone age
4011318 the practice included the reconstruction of all of the facial features of the deceased by means of sculpting the skull with a variety of materials such as plaster that was specifically intended for this on the skulls that were found in the excavation the nose was entirely reconstructed
4011319 some time thereafter the residents would dig up the grave retrieve the skull from the rest of the skeleton and recover the grave later they would then mold the skull in the image of the deceased and keep it inside the house
4011320 this custom is known in the scientific literature as ancestor worship
4011321 the cabinet is likely to take up the sixth pay panel report for approval tomorrow and the matter was discussed at a meeting chaired by the pm today

4011323 i cant afford to take losses of 1 3 billion forever
4011324 the reasons for the decrease in earnings are well known rapidly rising jet fuel prices to record high levels combined with weaker economic trends and overcapacity in the market
4011325 there is no doubt that the situation in the air travel industry is serious and probably the most difficult it has ever been
4011326 the group should deliver significantly improved earnings in the second half of 2008 mainly due to the favourable coal and iron ore market conditions
4011327 as a company we are faced with a shortage of the basic critical raw materials used to make our tires
4011328 the result is a dramatic rise in prices for commodities such as butadiene natural rubber and other materials in addition the continuing high prices for gasoline and diesel fuel affects every aspect of our business from manufacturing to distribution and makes this action necessary
4011329 we are doing our best to contain costs through efficient operations and by using the latest manufacturing technologies
4011330 however raw materials energy and transportation costs continue to soar and our pricing unfortunately must reflect these record high costs we remain committed as always though in bringing the best products to market with the most competitive prices
4011331 the proposed agreement eliminated various restrictions so that our contracted employers could haul more cars thereby providing additional job opportunities to our members and protecting their job security
4011332 however our members have made it clear that they do not accept the proposal
4011333 while the improvements came at some cost the carriers achieved some operating flexibility and opportunities to bid on new work they previously couldnt service the job security of all carhaulers is enhanced by better allowing the carriers to efficiently compete in markets where they can go head to head against non union carriers
4011334 reflect strength in diesel demand particularly in emerging markets which has significantly increased the margins between diesel prices and crude oil costs from those of last year
4011335 we applaud vinluxs adoption of peterbilt hybrid vehicles as well as their innovative business model and commitment to environmental responsibility
4011336 our medium duty hybrid vehicles have proven to not only provide a 30 50 percent increase in fuel efficiency depending upon the application but also dramatically reduce tailpipe emissions of hydrocarbon carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen
4011337 were committed to going green and protecting the californian environment and the peterbilt hybrids are a perfect solution for us
4011338 by adding hybrid vehicles to our fleet we expect our investment will be returned in as little as two years based on the rapidly escalating price of fuel
4011339 the hybrid demonstration tour will allow customers to experience the excellent performance and ease of operation of our new hybrid medium duty vehicles
4011340 these vehicles provide dramatic fuel savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the advanced hybrid technology
4011341 the ata lawsuit is not a pass to ignore the in place deadlines of the clean truck plan
4011342 drayage trucking companies who are serious about doing business with the port would be prudent to continue on track to complete concessionaire applications get their trucks registered on the system make sure their drivers have twic cards and make sure they have no pre 1989 trucks in their port fleet that will be denied access on october 1
4011343 emergency road service is a vital component in keeping trucks moving across the country
4011344 it is essential for us to ensure that truckers who choose to run on michelin tires have the best possible access to our products in an emergency interstar has long been a service provider to the trucking community and we believe that this expansion of michelin product availability both standard dual tires and x one tires is a great advantage for truckers
4011345 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
4011346 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
4011347 it really makes little sense to try to upgrade our infrastructure using a revenue source as ineffective unsustainable and unpopular as the fuel tax
4011348 secretary peters plan to overhaul our nations transportation investment strategy begins the much needed transition away from status quo solutions that produce status quo results her plan strengthens the abilities of state and local officials to integrate effective transit and highway solutions to meet americans ever changing travel demands
4011349 our second quarter results reflect the benefits of sales mix continued cost control and savings resulting from our global savings program initiatives these results were achieved in spite of dramatic vehicle production declines in the u s market which we were able to offset with stronger hybrid and heavy duty market sales
4011350 while we are pleased with ebitdar growth and profit improvement in operations we face challenging market conditions and earnings pressure for the rest of 2008 due to continued high raw material costs unfavorable currency rates and the downturn in north american automotive sales
4011351 this is the first time when we actually see the effect of dark energy in a picture

4011367 his ability to push the tempo get inside the lane shoot from the perimeter and distribute the ball will be very valuable for us
4011368 i think there was so much pressure on lebron to create so much of the offense in cleveland
4011369 i think somebody like mo is going to really make the game easier for lebron and create opportunities for other people
4011370 and theres always so many stories about how fighters became champions
4011371 college is a whole different level its a lot harder than i expected it to be
4011372 i was star struck and it was my favorite college and i was from southern california and wanted to be close to home
4011373 but as things progressed i started to notice they had five star athletes at my position that hadnt played the year before
4011374 we had always talked during the triple crown trail about wanting to end the season in the right way and thats in the breeders cup classic
4011375 we are the guys who when we land its completely bare

4011379 football is a passion for me when you enjoy something it doesnt matter the obstacles you go for what you believe in and what you want thats what i did i trained for it i prepared myself and when the chance came i took it
4011380 i let the coaches know a little about my background and how i can contribute to the team
4011381 he is really progressing as a football player after being away from the game you can definitely see improvement
4011382 there is a different football iq with him he is still playing some catch up but he is getting there he is an experienced guy in terms of his age being a lot older than the other guys in our meetings they might be ahead as far as football goes but he has them in life experiences

4011384 what it takes to be a generalist in todays market
4011385 i dont want to say there is some magic solution it is very difficult in the space of six months to turn back decades of neglect he told reporters
4011386 this was an important win but wed be making a big mistake to underestimate the second leg
4011387 dont forget that artmedia succeeded in a very difficult task against celtic a few years ago however were obviously very pleased at having gained such a big victory juve have missed european competition in the last two seasons and the squad was eager to come back in style we performed very well putting in a performance which met the expectations of our fans
4011388 were really satisfied with both the score and our display
4011389 the whole squad put in a great performance despite lacking match fitness and our tempo obviously decreased in the latter stages if we carry on like this we should win away too
4011390 avneet needs experience and think she was not prepared enough of course none expected her to win a medal but she was not in the best shape of her shooting career and it was a very okay sort of performance
4011391 i expected her to shoot 580 plus she was under pressure and this is surely disappointing when you see her score against her ability
4011392 for nearly two years we did not get any ammunition i told the secretary general of national rifle association of india baljit singh sethi that if we want to prepare well for the 2010 commonwealth games and the next olympics it has to start from september 1 we need three groups elite supporting and youngsters and there should be enough competition events in india
4011393 there is not enough competition in india and abhinav bindra was smart enough to stay out and compete in europe instead other teams practice 270 day a year and we come nowhere near that we got just two and a half years to prepare for beijing and that does not ensure medals
4011394 silent killer as described by his father he is the one who spotted his sons talent when abhinav was 5 years old
4011395 he kept a water balloon on our maids head and began shooting knowing little that a slight mistake could have proved fatal but his aim was so perfect that i couldnt think about anything else but make him a pro
4011396 its a great honour for me its a huge honour i am really proud of it i am very happy to have done the nation proud the gold medal was the dream of my life and i am happy to achieve it
4011397 i welcomed him with a tight hug and a kiss
4011398 shooting is a concentration sport and he is specially taught to be calm and composed
4011399 we have a lot of vehicles all trying to get into the port of felixstowe this morning its like trying to squeeze too many into too small a space at one time

4011408 organised crime pervades aspects of the victorian racing industry its presence is most apparent in the betting ring where the laundering of proceeds of crime has been commonplace

4011418 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and my core beliefs
4011419 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail ok i dont believe that unless he also happens to entertain a death wish i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
4011420 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
4011421 its a function of several things the aging of the traditional population the birthrate of the newer population the immigrant population but also the growth of the hispanic culture not just in the desert southwest but across the united states
4011422 all of these social forces are coming to a head and were going to see by 2050 a dramatic shift in the rest of the country
4011423 but for those of us in southern california its happened look at the san fernando valley what theyre projecting for the rest of the country has already transpired in los angeles
4011424 if we think that politicians are starting to pay attention to latinos and latino communities now you aint seen nothing yet
4011425 virtually across the board were going to see increasing demands for more equitable distribution of power and power arrangements in and beyond california
4011426 on the one hand it has developed a kind of tolerance that is a majority way of thinking
4011427 if we want to make sure that we have a high quality work force that meets the needs of an increasingly globalized economy
4011428 we need to address the needs of our public schools so that the young people have the skills they need to replace the baby boomers
4011429 we need to begin planning to meet the needs of a growing population as well as in many cases begin to maintain the systems that we built many years ago that havent been properly maintained over time

4011479 we want a specific political accord between the president and all 32 governors of mexico to commit to reducing the rates of kidnapping in mexico
4011480 the state is not dismantling organized crime groups through the confiscation of assets freezing of assets of the financial intelligence unit and is not cooperating with police and prosecutors effectively
4011481 because nothing much has been done every day there are more and more kidnappings and everybody is affected

4011493 the only thing left is for them to invade and kill us
4011494 if the cease fire is just a front for extremists in gaza to rearm and regroup of course we have the right to act

4011506 already there is reason to believe that race is weighing obama down
4011507 to blow it open obama needs to bring leeges number down that may be possible because even racists can be wooed think about it this way many of the voters who right now wont vote for obama because hes black would probably vote for colin powell even though hes black thats because they dont see powell as a racial redistributionist a guy who would favor his community at their expense theres no rational reason to believe obama would either but because unlike powell obama is a liberal democrat who enjoys overwhelming black support thats what many racially hostile white voters assume
4011508 thats because they dont see powell as a racial redistributionist a guy who would favor his community at their expense

4011551 there was an atmosphere of war about to break out from my point of view the battles of the past few days were to be expected
4011552 we have good relations with russia and georgia and dont want to back either in this conflict we therefore made a decision to drastically minimize sales of weapons to georgia
4011553 we need high speed internet for our homes schools hospitals and workplaces
4011554 speed defines what is possible on the internet it determines whether we will have the 21st century networks we need to create the jobs of the future develop our economy and support innovations in telemedicine education public safety and public services to improve our lives and communities
4011555 china is being sold the hi tech model of development and we think there is a model which works with the local character of chinese planning to achieve sustainability
4011556 weve got to get out of the habit of thinking that we only need to focus on improving the technology that we can invent our way out of this situation
4011557 weve got to do everything we can think of including reducing the size of the task by real conservation
4011558 its driven by more proximate factors such as if you become obese or youre smoking too much or you contract diabetes medications can depress sexual interest the aging process itself is not a major factor driving these results
4011559 if sexual health goes to hell it may be a canary in the mine shaft it may be a sign of health problems
4011560 anxiety is very clearly a big factor in sexual dysfunction for women and depression in men
4011561 and men can become very depressed because of sexual dysfunction
4011562 we have some gaps but only a blind man would suggest they are in attack
4011563 no team can win the title with a grey away kit sorry scousers youll have to postpone this is our year again

4011567 which team will go down with hull and stoke haha brilliant
4011568 jn so arsenal look short of goals do they with attacking options of adebayor van persie vela bendtner amp eduardo to come in id say we have plenty of goals in us well score more than last season and we reached over 100 then
4011569 another interesting point for me is now under scolari chelsea are going expected to play attacking football throwing off the shackles of maureen now im not sure they are ready to go toe to toe with arsenal and united in that type of game it will take quite a while to unbreak habits of defense and caution that have been ingrained by maureen
4011570 tonight the city is full of morgues and all the toilets are overflowing

4011590 the ioc does disapprove of any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about or doing his job seemingly within the
4011591 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4011592 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4011593 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4011594 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4011595 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4011596 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4011597 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4011598 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4011599 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4011600 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4011601 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4011602 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4011603 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4011604 one other point that people have spoken about is the issue of the treaty and its domestication well processes like from experience is not something that can be concluded in a day
4011605 the hand over for instance is just a process tomorrow today might just be a symbolic way of starting the process of hand over because when you hand over you have to take care of creating or re naming or re creating the bakassi local government as enshrined in the third schedule of the constitution
4011606 the senate in its wisdom has already done quite a lot of work on the bakassi issue you know that we have a joint committee that has been working on it and it would be over flogging the issue for us to come to floor today yesterday and start talking about it
4011607 a lot of issues are involved we have to choose between being the bad boy of the international community and reneging on the process of hand over we believe that there is a whole lot of things the government can still do
4011608 we can still even after being seen to abide by the law enter into some form of negotiation because we have already been assured despite lots investigation that that part of bakassi is not really very heavy with mineral deposit as alleged
4011609 the other issue is the egress and ingress of our navy in the waterways in the course of doing their duties of protecting nigeria and of course the green tree agreement also spelt out those areas that on no account should cameroon constitute an impediment to nigerias military authorities or our military personnel having access or exit from the bakassi waters into the nigerian territorial waters because that actually is the major security issue that has been raised
4011610 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4011611 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4011612 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4011613 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4011614 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4011615 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4011616 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4011617 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4011618 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4011619 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4011620 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4011621 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4011627 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4011628 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4011644 we believe in the deity of the lord jesus christ as gods son jesus was both human and divine
4011645 the incarnation of the son of god out of mary cannot indeed consist of the origination for the first time here and now of the son of god but it consists of the son of god taking to himself here and now this other thing which exists previously in mary namely flesh humanity human nature humanness it claims that the man jesus has no father exactly in the way in which as the son of god he has no mother
4011646 his sinlessness as the god man in any case consisted of his overcoming the sinful fleshly nature which he had assumed
4011647 every good and perfect gift is from above coming down from the father of the heavenly lights he choose to give us birth through the word of truth that we might be a kind of first fruits of all he created
4011648 in him christ we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins
4011649 having believed you were marked in him with a seal the promised holy spirit
4011650 the father has his purpose the son says he is going to carry it out and he came and did it and the holy spirit said he is going to carry it out and he came and did it and the holy spirit said he was ready to apply it
4011651 but when the kindness and love of god our savior appeared he saved us not because of righteous things we had done but because of his mercy he saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the holy spirit whom he poured out on us generously through jesus christ our savior
4011652 jesus christ is the center and the holy spirit is the circumference
4011653 the church is both the locus and the bearer of salvation
4011654 the church being the locus of salvation insofar as there is no other place where salvation is to be found

4011667 this time last year you couldnt keep a lid on it at all
4011668 the town was in a frenzy that anxiety anticipation and the nerves of going into another finals series
4011669 are they going to lose again all those sorts of things
4011670 this year its been pretty calm theres a definite level of expectation amongst our supporters and theyre expecting the best
4011671 but not so much the frenzy there was last year more a gradual buildup
4011672 it could be a preview for a qualifying final in a months time
4011673 its a showpiece game for the afl and we wont be taking our foot off the accelerator at all
4011674 we are on a hot streak and youve got to cash your cheques when theyre due
4011675 this year and in footy in general there doesnt seem to be those one on one matchups there used to be in the past
4011676 its very much a rotation thing and goodesy is certainly one of those players who could be rotated through because hes a threat and theres plenty of homework to be done on him
4011677 it was one of the most memorable games ive ever played in

4011686 we are working hard to join the ioc and our aim is to compete at the london olympics

4011729 we are going to make sure that anybody that tells montana gun owners that barack obama is not a threat to gun owners is exposed as someone who is not shooting straight
4011730 the nra is wrong to suggest we are misleading anybody
4011731 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
4011732 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
4011733 i figure theres no way i can unseat him that was not my goal
4011734 the demographics of seattle are such that i do not believe that if i could bring abraham lincoln back to life that he could be elected in the city of seattle
4011735 people here they know mcdermott pretty well and he has all the advantages of name recognition
4011736 hes about as safe a congressional incumbent as you could find
4011737 came to see that the republican party was far superior on foreign policy
4011738 im not sailing into very tough wind in that kind of district
4011739 no child should have to go though something like this they are playing with toys they shouldnt be harmed because of it
4011740 there was no way i was going to buy my children a toy again
4011741 this bill represents the most significant improvements to product safety since congress created the cpsc in the 1970s
4011742 congress responded to the wishes of parents and children all across america and passed legislation that will help restore our confidence in the safety of our toys and everyday products
4011743 god has blessed us with our son being ok and now gave me a tool to say we need to have this stopped
4011744 its not ok for lead to be in childrens toys
4011745 our position is no the only thing in front of the court is the request to get the taxpayers money back
4011746 the parties see a range of issues and thats where the disagreement is
4011747 the right of a political party to protect the use of its name is well recognized
4011748 it wouldnt unring the bell if the primary has already been conducted
4011749 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion
4011750 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home
4011751 i think this is a very poor time to send a signal that the united states is not interested in focusing on warfighting in the cyber domain
4011752 this senseless tragedy comes as a shock to all of us we pray for his full and speedy recovery
4011753 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4011754 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4011755 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4011756 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4011757 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4011758 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4011759 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4011760 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4011761 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4011762 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4011763 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4011764 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4011765 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4011766 we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people
4011767 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
4011768 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
4011769 i think its going to be one of the great conspiracy theories like whether we landed on the moon or whether lee harvey oswald acted alone
4011770 there are a lot of people in science who are weird or unstable
4011771 i dont consider myself among the hardcore conspiracy theorists that this is a total cover up it looks more like bungled investigation
4011772 these are people with what appears to be a potential significant motive
4011773 were i an fbi agent i would be investigating them to see whether they actually had means and opportunity to carry out an attack like this
4011774 they didnt decide to pin the job on bruce ivins after they sent out the anthrax letters they had already decided on using him beforehand
4011775 as dangerous as it could possibly be and also deeply mysterious
4011776 its almost a generic aspect of conspiracy theories that some of the most important witnesses or the fall guy for that matter think lee harvey oswald is now dead because they cant contradict or complicate a conspiracy theory
4011777 ive seen the theories that he was a pawn like lee harvey oswald thats going to be hard to disprove
4011778 how do you disprove that a dead man was not a puppet being manipulated by the cia youre talking about proving a negative you cant prove aliens didnt mail the letters
4011779 det finns uppgifter som visar att ryssland skickat frivilliga fr n nordossetien
4011780 would i turn my nose up at another round with shodan no
4011781 everything always changes the best plan lasts until the first arrow leaves the bow
4011782 the diesel is still missing by 30 percent and we have witnessed how oil companies are uninterested in the problem since they are the real culprits for this but in addition the government looks and does nothing
4011783 semuanya berlalu begitu cepat saat ini masanya generasi baru dan saatnya saya untuk menyisih
4011784 mereka tampil sangat baik saya sendiri berasal dari generasi yang sama dengan alexander popov
4011785 saya sudah berkali kali menghadapi alain bernard namun tidak mengetahuinya kami bertemu sebelum perlombaan dan dia merupakan seorang yang luar biasa dia seorang atlet yang luar biasa
4011786 suatu masa yang panjang olimpiade saya yang keempat final saya yang keempat di nomor 100 meter gaya bebas
4011787 olimpiade selalu merupakan sesuatu yang istimewa buat saya saya mendapat inspirasi saat menyaksikan perenang as matt biondi di olimpiade seoul 1988
4011788 setelah delapan tahun sejak sydney 2000 dan berenang dengan waktu 47 detik waktu di sini lebih buruk daripada di sydney saya harus menyadari ini beberapa saat lalu saya menyesal karena sebenarnya hampir memperoleh pernggu saya selalu berpikir tentang kemenangan sesuatu yang sulit diraih bila menghadapi perenang seperti eamon sullivan dan alain bernard
4011789 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
4011790 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4011791 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
4011792 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
4011793 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4011794 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4011795 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying
4011796 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4011797 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
4011798 there is a very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
4011799 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia
4011800 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
4011801 oh look how cute it knocked a pot off the window sill
4011802 everyone knows inter milan made a bid for me that was an option i had to look at ive always had a great relationship with jose mourinho and ill never forget what he brought to me as a player and as a person but i made my decision for frank lampard i want to do what is best for me my family and my football there was a time i had to consider where i wanted to be whether in london or away from there for my own reasons that was a huge decision but the relationship i had with the club and the support i had made me realise this is where i want to be its been difficult but my family and i will always come first they understood and backed me
4011803 the performance was poor but the result was good it is always important not to concede away from home and with the second leg at anfield there will have to be a massive difference i didnt need to say much to the players afterwards because they know it was a bad performance
4011804 keanes debut did resemble that of a liverpool no 7 but it was so anonymous as to be almost harry kewell like
4011805 wally with the brolly to the man with the plan
4011806 steve mcclaren showed new signs of delusion last night insisting i outwitted arsene wenger
4011807 stokes best hope is surely to foster a crazy gang spirit
4011808 the champions of belgium came close to inflicting an embarrassing defeat on a liverpool team whose performance could not even be described as bog standard liverpool were awful so wretched in every department that even rafael ben tez who prefers not to stray from the banal in post match press conferences described the display as very bad ring rustiness of some kind is to be expected in the first competitive game of the campaign but this the manager admitted was unexpectedly poor after a largely encouraging pre season programme
4011809 when robbie keane achieved his boyhood ambition and became a liverpool player he commented that only a fan of the club would know what it was to wear the no 7 shirt that had graced the backs of kevin keegan and kenny dalglish men who won the european cup in rome keanes debut did resemble that of a liverpool no 7 but it was so anonymous as to be almost harry kewell like after 68 minutes his manager rafael benitez had seen enough and brought on a more tested liverpool hero steven gerrard who in the 90th minute produced their only shot on target
4011810 after walking through a storm with england mcclaren seems to have found some friends here even in defeat mcclaren and his purposeful players were applauded from the field england coaches rarely find life easy after leaving the impossible job but mcclaren impressed here his tactics confusing arsene wengers side until midway through the second half when gallas and adebaylor rendered the second leg largely insignificant
4011811 chased out of the country after 15 miserable months as england boss mcclaren is now looking to rebuild his battered reputation in holland but even he could not have imagined it would take him just one match to go from the wally with the brolly to the man with the plan
4011812 oh no steve mcclaren showed new signs of delusion last night insisting i outwitted arsene wenger his astonishing claim came after the former england boss watched his new side fc twente lose 2 0 to arsenal in the first leg of their champions league qualifier
4011813 frank lampard became the highest paid player in the premier league yesterday after signing a new five year contract with chelsea
4011814 the england midfielder midway through last season was committed to leaving chelsea he felt his career at stamford bridge after nearly seven years had gone as far as it could his mentor mourinho had gone the glory and glamour had faded the love affair with the club withered but then his mother pat without question the driving force in lampards career died after contracting pneumonia on april 24 this year and everything changed as the daily express has revealed lampard was understandably thrown into mental turmoil the support that chelsea and his team mates showed him during that awful time in his life became a crucial factor in turning lampard towards staying
4011815 it may appear a shade incongruous bizarre even but one of the most protracted most talked about and potentially most expensive transfer deals of the summer should reach a conclusion in this small football outpost tonight if as expected gareth barry sets foot on the pitch at the laugardalsv llur stadium the possible move of the aston villa midfield player to liverpool is likely to be off should barry play he will become ineligible to take part in the champions league until the knockout stages in february
4011816 it is expected that the bulgarian will arrive at uniteds carrington training ground as early as thursday to finalise personal terms and undergo a medical he is set to be presented as a united player before sundays match against newcastle as sir alex ferguson looks to cement the final link in his squad to challenge for a third straight premier league title tottenham have hastened the search for a replacement although monaco forward nene claims to have been approached by spurs coach juande ramos arshavin is the prime target tottenham are believed to have cooled on plans to sign roman pavlyuchenko arshavins international team mate and ramos could yet be forced to deploy darren bent as a lone striker
4011817 the wheels are turning slowly on their move for andrei arshavin tottenhams 17m offer for the russian euro2008 star turn is still a couple of million short of zenit st petersburgs valuation of their prize asset in the meantime juande ramos is exploring the possibility of bringing back kanoute from his former club sevilla in an effort to bring tottenham up to scratch and provide serious competition for darren bent
4011818 it could be that city will have to raise their bid to 14m for santa cruz but given the crisis they face with strikers following a thigh injury to benjani mwaruwari which rules him out of the first few months of the season and with jo on olympic duty they may be willing to increase their offer hughes is desperate for santa cruz to arrive before sundays league opener at aston villa especially as darius vassell is also now injured and will be out for around 10 weeks after suffering ligament damage hughes at present has to choose between valeri bojinov ronaldo bianchi and the youngsters felipe caicedo danny sturridge and ched evans
4011819 with the fa running its respect agenda and public outrage growing at newcastles refusal to sack barton sanctions threaten to be severe much will depend on how strongly the independent regulatory commission which will hear bartons case is influenced by public opinion it remains to be seen whether the fact that the offence did not happen at newcastle and that barton was subsequently suspended by city will impact on the hearing
4011820 stokes best hope is surely to foster a crazy gang spirit aided by an intimidating home crowd set piece expertise and a load of hairy arsed headless chickens with an unmatched work ethic indeed pulis has already had the pitch shortened and narrowed if he was allowed hed probably play stokes home games in a phonebox
4011821 its hard to see sunderland really struggling partly because there are so many teams who are likely to be significantly weaker than them partly because they have a large well balanced if not high quality squad but mainly because of keane and quinn seventh from bottom or perhaps eight is unlikely to satisfy all their ambitions for now but its probably where theyll end up
4011822 by common consent the beautiful game is scarred by the behaviour of players managers fans and directors this is so commonplace it is assumed to be insoluble is it not even possible that football adopt measures used by other sports to address this these self inflicted wounds could be rectified quite easily but there is not the desire or courage not just within the relevant ruling bodies but also players managers and fans
4011823 the old irritations have not been expelled there are pre season aches and pains to hinder england and michael owen stricken by a calf strain and mumps is due for his first practice game today even if he nurses ambitions of being involved when newcastle united go to old trafford on sunday others such as wayne rooney and emile heskey are doubts as well
4011824 turning the working mans ballet into the preserve of the middle class and middle aged
4011825 with commercial departments at some clubs expressing private concerns that imminent recession will dramatically hit corporate box and hospitality revenues this refusal to turn a blind eye to economic gloom may yet prove impressively far sighted
4011826 some employees receive only match tickets as recompense or the promise of commission the five london clubs arsenal chelsea fulham tottenham hotspur and west ham united are paying staff at least 2 below the london living wage of 7 45 which the mayor boris johnson says is the minimum to avoid living in poverty in the city the fpn found blackburn rovers was offering one match ticket per month and possible commission for a part time post selling lottery tickets
4011827 wherever he has gone as a club executive lalas has left confusion and gutted teams in his wake from san jose to the metrostars red bulls to the galaxy the red headed lalas has been strong on the bombast side of things but inept in nearly every facet of running a team perhaps lalass best skill if you want to call it that is the constant churn of rosters as players and coaches come and go of course hindsight is wonderful but one has to wonder what condition the metrostars red bulls would be in now if lalas had not fired bob bradley as the teams coach imagine a roster that might still include michael bradley ricardo clark marvell wynne and several other promising players who were summarily dumped overboard
4011828 has mcclaren gone from being the wally with the brolly to the man with the plan

4011854 as a company we are faced with a shortage of the basic critical raw materials used to make our tires
4011855 the result is a dramatic rise in prices for commodities such as butadiene natural rubber and other materials in addition the continuing high prices for gasoline and diesel fuel affects every aspect of our business from manufacturing to distribution and makes this action necessary
4011856 we are doing our best to contain costs through efficient operations and by using the latest manufacturing technologies
4011857 however raw materials energy and transportation costs continue to soar and our pricing unfortunately must reflect these record high costs we remain committed as always though in bringing the best products to market with the most competitive prices

4011873 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
4011874 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
4011875 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
4011876 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
4011877 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
4011878 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
4011879 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
4011880 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
4011881 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
4011882 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
4011883 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
4011884 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
4011885 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
4011886 i have to be careful because sometimes hell do a fast movement or run

4011889 police booked his ticket from ho chi minh city to london and i have already paid for the ticket on his behalf
4011890 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
4011891 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
4011892 it is a much more common scenario today than it would have been even five years ago
4011893 this bold experiment is pushing the boundaries and raising many questions
4011894 the donors are not dead i understand that they would like us to change the definition of death but they cant do that by themselves its very problematic to start treating a baby as an organ donor before its dead
4011895 the whole issue is whether the infants from whom the hearts were taken were dead it seems very clear to me that they were not
4011896 i think its illegal and if its illegal what were talking about is the physicians causing the death of the three patients and that would be homicide its immoral i think it should be stopped
4011897 at the end of the day we feel we are on very firm ground
4011898 there is no question these all met the criteria that one would establish for death
4011899 as difficult as that was to hear this opportunity provided us with a ray of hope
4011900 at that point zachary was so sick we did have him at home but we knew it wasnt much longer

4011903 no other country has experienced such rapid racial and ethnic change
4011904 a momentum is built into this as a result of past immigration
4011905 in the 1970s 80s and 90s there were more hispanic immigrants than births this decade there are more births than immigrants almost regardless of what you assume about future immigration the country will be more hispanic and asian
4011906 whats happening now in terms of increasing diversity probably is unprecedented
4011907 within the conventional definition of race of white black asian minority vs nonminority this is a big change
4011908 we have 2 million reasons for him to be returned to us communicate with us
4011909 those who grabbed him were police officers and the last thing we wanted was for the police to be involved
4011910 we must purge police agencies to get rid of those infiltrated by crime
4011911 we must put an end to the conspiracy between criminals and the authorities

4011959 there is complete agreement between the club and the player david jimenez silva that he will remain with us for the next five seasons
4011960 we have always expressed the hope that he will stay with us

4012041 ive tried to keep myself fit during my time off and played a couple of games for durham and then after that club cricket but adapting to international cricket again is going to be my big challenge irrespective of the conditions

4012052 with violence escalating the troubled state of jammu and kashmir is again at the brink of catastrophe to end this cycle of tragedy the government of india should order troops to act with restraint and all parties should try to settle the dispute peacefully
4012053 we are not planning to attack anyone but our partners should clearly understand that the armed forces will be used if necessary to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the russian federation and its allies including on a preventative basis including with the use of nuclear weapons

4012077 eigentlich hat die kunst sich immer sehr bem ht sich der mode zu verweigern aber heute ist sie mit ihr eine symbiose eingegangen inzwischen ist mode auch so eine art inszenierung die weit ber das dekorative hinausgeht
4012078 ja doch sie kann einen mit dem ansinnen des bleibenwollens auch bedrohen nicht wahr ich meine alles ist verg nglich au erdem ist es ja auch nicht so dass man nach einer saison alles wegwirft ich entdecke oft kleider die drei vier jahre alt sind und denke ach so etwas sch nes f llt dir heute nicht mehr ein ich geh re ja noch zu den dinosauriern der mode die alles selbst machen
4012079 ja und irritation ich finde kleider die aussehen als br uchte man anziehhilfen unerotisch designer wie alexander mcqueen foltern frauen mit korsetts und st tzstangen meine kleider sollen so aussehen als ob jemand wie brigitte bardot direkt aus dem meer kommt wie damals in cannes ich sah das als junge die brauchte nur ein schlampiges t shirt dagegen wirkten alle anderen hollywood stars auf einmal wie alte gebrauchte cadillacs

4012087 they are a big strong side and will be no walkover
4012088 midtjylland are an accomplished team and we certainly cannot treat them lightly nothing must distract us from our performance because they are the most difficult team that we could have drawn
4012089 we know what can happen if you are not on your game and even at this early stage of the competition the days of beating sides five or six nil are long gone midtjylland are an imposing dynamic side that gets around the pitch well we have to take them very seriously

4012091 vedran is aware of my thoughts and is a city player
4012092 valeri has been great for us since coming back from injury
4012093 he plays with a smile on his face and even in training has a celebration that everyone including the players waits for
4012094 he will be a big player for us and has the potential to be a real match winner it is important that we have success in europe we want to progress because we feel we have the quality to make it to the latter stages the one worry is that midtjylland are hard match fit
4012095 i was encouraged greatly by the win over milan the players are implementing the things we have asked them to do and we more than held our own which was pleasing
4012096 it is clear that after babas performance on sunday we have a young man with immense confidence in our squad

4012110 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4012111 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle

4012149 youll never see politics or information on any of these networks
4012150 if we had no news division it would be important to show that speech
4012151 theres no telling when it will happen again it certainly hasnt happened before
4012152 its important for our viewers to be able to see both sides
4012153 i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years
4012154 we are all totally devastated and cannot imagine life without paul
4012155 we ask that if anybody knows anything about what happened no matter how insignificant it might seem to please come forward

4012158 estamos viendo en esta inspecci n que los mayoristas est n dando precios por encima de la gaceta bueno vamos a ir a los mayoristas a que nos expliquen porque ellos reciben todos los d lares preferenciales que solicitan pero no consideran al pueblo s lo piensan en las ganancias ah est parte de la conspiraci n todo esto lo llevaremos al centro de balance nacional de alimentos dirigido por la vicepresidencia porque en el caso del t chira consumimos el 35 de los productos alimenticios del pa s que llegan aqu donde apenas est el 6 de la poblaci n nacional con eso elaboramos la hip tesis de que se est n exportando los productos que son subsidiados por el gobierno para la dieta del venezolano

4012161 he came up and started stabbing her immediately without any words or argument
4012162 he did not stop his murderous acts voluntarily but because of the heroic acts of the neighbor
4012163 its a dynamic time for our organization and our art form
4012164 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
4012165 figures into the big picture whoever wins jabbas favor will have a key advantage in the clone wars
4012166 given the cutthroat politics moscow has practiced at home and abroad in recent years with only the softest protests from the u s and its allies no one should be surprised by russias decision to conquer the two breakaway regions of georgia nevertheless it should once and for all disabuse policy makers in washington and brussels of hopes that russia intends to become part of the post cold war condominium of democratic peace in europe the point of the kremlins invasion of georgia which now threatens the capital city of tbilisi is to demonstrate to the world how impotent that security order has become
4012167 for moscow georgian president mikheil saakashvilis mistake in finally taking the bait of russian provocations and ordering his troops in south ossetia last week was the opening they sought and for which they had been planning for some time russia has been at war with democratic georgia for some time driven to distraction by mr saakashvilis assertiveness and georgias desire to join nato russian prime minister vladimir putin first tried to bring the country to its knees through economic warfare beginning in 2005 he cut off access to russian markets expelled georgians from russia quadrupled the price of russian energy to georgia and severed transport links
4012168 unable to bend tbilisi to its will the kremlin in recent months ratcheted up the pressure and provocations in south ossetia and abkhazia reinforcing russian forces and russian backed paramilitaries violating georgian air space with russian jets shelling georgian villages and outposts and passing a resolution to treat the two provinces administratively as part of russia starting in 2004 russia began issuing passports to the residents of south ossetia and abkhazia a fact that today serves as one of the main pretexts for the ferocity of moscows military campaign
4012169 however georgias impertinence in seeking nato membership and building close ties with europe does not fully explain moscows blatant display of brute power in a speech before the munich conference on security policy in february last year mr putin made it clear that russia would no longer accept the rules of the international road as set by the democratic west it was an in your face challenge to the u s and europe and we blinked with the exception of john mccain who warned against needless confrontation on the part of moscow no american or european official at the conference made any attempt to push back ever since moscows contempt for nato the european union and washington has only grown
4012170 the real objective is the finlandization of georgia through the removal of president mikheil saakashvili and his replacement by a russian puppet which explains putin stopping the russian army for now short of tbilisi what everyone overlooks in the cease fire terms is that all future steps troop withdrawals territorial arrangements peacekeeping forces will have to be negotiated between russia and georgia but russia says it will not talk to saakashvili thus regime change becomes the first requirement for any movement on any front this will be putins refrain in the coming days he is counting on europe to pressure saakashvili to resign and or flee to give peace a chance
4012171 the finlandization of georgia would give russia control of the baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline which is the only significant european bound route for caspian sea oil and gas that does not go through russia pipelines are the economic lifelines of such former soviet republics as kazakhstan and azerbaijan that live off energy exports moscow would become master of the caspian basin subduing georgia has an additional effect it warns russias former baltic and east european satellites what happens if you get too close to the west it is the first step to re establishing russian hegemony in the region

4012173 the key thing about this is that the process will be fully automated so there is no requirement for a skilled person to use the technology
4012174 theres nothing to say that a veterinary lab assistant couldnt go out and swab birds and run the test at present tests have to be sent to a lab where you need fully trained personnel and thats where the hold up occurs
4012175 while there are matters for improvement asics view is that nevertheless asx had adequate arrangements in place for the review period and with these agreed actions should continue to have adequate arrangements
4012176 weve already spent some 50 million buying back some 35 gigalitres from the system
4012177 we have today agreed that we will initiate 80 million of water buyback earmarked for south australia
4012178 we will also now conduct a queensland water tender from those who hold water entitlements in queensland
4012179 extending the existing commitment of 34 million to 40 million
4012180 that is 400 million allocated now for the purchase back of water entitlements in the northern basin from queensland and nsw down to the menindee lakes
4012181 theres been some challenge to the accuracy of the murray darling commission numbers
4012182 we will commission one of the independent accounting houses of the world to separately and independently audit the accuracy of the murray darling basin commissions numbers
4012183 this time last year you couldnt keep a lid on it at all
4012184 the town was in a frenzy that anxiety anticipation and the nerves of going into another finals series
4012185 are they going to lose again all those sorts of things
4012186 this year its been pretty calm theres a definite level of expectation amongst our supporters and theyre expecting the best
4012187 but not so much the frenzy there was last year more a gradual buildup
4012188 it could be a preview for a qualifying final in a months time
4012189 its a showpiece game for the afl and we wont be taking our foot off the accelerator at all
4012190 we are on a hot streak and youve got to cash your cheques when theyre due
4012191 this year and in footy in general there doesnt seem to be those one on one matchups there used to be in the past
4012192 its very much a rotation thing and goodesy is certainly one of those players who could be rotated through because hes a threat and theres plenty of homework to be done on him

4012205 caro max ma perche non scrivi sulla stampa italiana allestero sul web non pensi sia importante
4012206 it is safe to say that according to press reports barack obama avoided skipped canceled the visit because of those reasons
4012207 in the name of freedom these websites allow the broadcast of slander lies and swearing the use of harsh degrading language and racial slurs without regard for the reader or those concerned
4012208 in the name of freedom these websites allow the broadcast of slander lies and swearing the use of harsh degrading language and racial slurs without regard for the reader or those concerned
4012209 even though the government has been tolerant of anti government positions and criticisms on the internet we are very concerned about statements that insult religion and reek of racism
4012210 civil and political rights such as the right to free speech dissent and assembly are as important as economic rights such as the right to a job housing medical care and education
4012211 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4012212 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4012213 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4012214 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4012215 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4012216 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4012217 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4012218 many of us are motivated by a deep disgust with and distrust of the dnc leadership
4012219 there will be no unity in the democratic party until the voices of the 18 million voters who support hillary clinton are heard and heeded until the voices of pumas are once again listened to by the leadership of the democratic party we will be guided by that defiance we will not be bullied brainwashed or bossed into falling in line
4012220 i woke up that morning and said holy smoke theyre not even gonna let her run and compete the obama campaign is gonna sit back and take the benefits of that crap from msnbcs mike barnicle and chris matthews and tucker carlson and maureen dowd and howard dean thats what did it for me
4012221 our goal is to get the dnc to follow the process and let the delegates vote for her nomination
4012222 theres a big difference between a hope and a goal
4012223 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4012224 we have a lot of support and a following in stockton
4012225 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4012226 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4012227 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4012228 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
4012229 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
4012230 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4012231 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4012232 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4012233 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
4012234 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
4012235 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
4012236 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
4012237 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4012238 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4012239 we must lower gas prices and a chicken in every pot for every voting american
4012240 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4012241 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4012242 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4012243 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4012244 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4012245 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4012246 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4012247 im not a part of groupthink not part of a trifecta ticket with candidates in the other two districts
4012248 they can call me a spoiler but im in the race to win
4012249 its unconscionable to change your form of government without having actually read the foundation document
4012250 representative democracy made indian river county charter government made miami dade
4012251 i dont want to live in a community where its only open to the wealthiest 1 percent of americans
4012252 i want to live in a community thats open to all americans
4012253 well what right do you have to speak about them then
4012254 this is a truly great leader a truly great man a truly inspiring man
4012255 its going to be a whos who of the convention
4012256 the denver school of the arts in colorado pulls off the rare achievement of bringing 40 young people aged 14 17 on stage showing off some impressive performing skills and offering the audience a truly substantial and moving glimpse into the mind of the generation now trembling on the cusp of adulthood
4012257 you have to declare a party affiliation to vote in the primaries and that concerns me
4012258 are you afraid im going to register as a communist
4012259 that deep insights about human nature come first to poets and artists to be systematically explored by scientists only decades or centuries later is not a new idea but i have never seen it more brilliantly illustrated than in this amazing first book by jonah lehrer who himself bridges
4012260 could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain who has experience and has been tested in war and tried in peace and another candidate that has not between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not between one candidate thats a talker and one candidate whos the leader america needs as our next president
4012261 clever negative advertising works that is reality the tactic meets with media and pundit disapproval and spawns accusations of negativity but the reality is that a clever negative ad can be devastatingly effective
4012262 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4012263 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4012264 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4012265 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4012266 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4012267 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4012268 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4012269 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4012270 georgian officials said the russians had looted and bombed gori before they left moscow denied the accusation but it appeared to be on a technicality a bbc reporter in gori said russian tanks were in the streets while their south ossetian allies seized cars looted homes and set houses on fire
4012271 heres a deal if by aug 17th georgia is not part of nato defacto or otherwise you will post a humble apology to me in your profile
4012272 we are the standard for all building structures of the future
4012273 russias ambassador to nato declared that georgian president mr saakashvili
4012274 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
4012275 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
4012276 the government of georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
4012277 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention i understand that
4012278 john edwards was a great champion of working people during the course of his campaign many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention and i wish them all well
4012279 yeah bomb the mess out of them take em over
4012280 hes ready to take his fight down into the mud
4012281 asks a valid question of whether the relatively inexperienced obama is ready to lead
4012282 oh ya i almost forgot to explain to carolyn and the others out there about
4012283 carolyn al is correct but it goes one step further mr weaver never intended to try and use the vi money for flood releif he wants to put a halt to anything to do with vision iowa and use the 5 8 million dollars that would have been the citys responsability and use it for flood releif
4012284 jb i forgot to mention that the speed limit on all trucks should be reduced to 45m
4012285 carolyn where to you get the idea that max wanted to use vi funds to aid flood victims
4012286 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
4012287 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
4012288 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
4012289 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
4012290 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
4012291 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
4012292 who will be the next president of the united states
4012293 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
4012294 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
4012295 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
4012296 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
4012297 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4012298 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how biden is looking more and more possible he is my first choice
4012299 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4012300 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4012301 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4012302 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4012303 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would

4012308 both those contracts and discussions have been put on the shelf
4012309 the season is starting and those will be re visited next year
4012310 this contract will take me to 34 and if you look around there are a lot of top professionals playing like ryan giggs players like that offering a lot to their club both on the pitch and off it
4012311 and i certainly feel that i can do that in a big way
4012312 i will never forget it i cant speak highly enough of the lads and what they did john terry as a captain creates that kind of spirit among the lads and the others follow because they are all great lads
4012313 when you go to your mums funeral you dont expect all the players to go there you might expect a representative from the club i had all the lads there and thats something that goes beyond football and shows you what real men are and what real friendships are
4012314 i made my decision for frank lampard simple as that i want to do what is best for me my family and my football
4012315 all i can say is that he is one of the best managers in the world hes shown that when he was here and i have no doubts he will be successful in the future wherever he goes

4012319 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors obviously for election outcomes all that matters is whether people vote not whether they do so enthusiastically a challenge for obama is to convert highly energized supporters there is currently an enthusiasm gap favoring obama into registered voters and then into actual voters
4012320 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
4012321 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
4012322 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
4012323 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its commitment to georgias territorial integrity that commitment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their commitment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense commitment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato

4012330 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
4012331 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
4012332 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
4012333 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
4012334 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
4012335 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
4012336 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
4012337 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4012338 the populations seem to be gradually going downhill and its not clear if or when thats going to stop
4012339 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
4012340 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
4012341 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
4012342 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
4012343 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
4012344 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
4012345 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
4012346 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
4012347 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
4012348 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
4012349 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4012350 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4012351 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4012352 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4012353 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4012354 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4012355 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4012356 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4012357 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4012358 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4012359 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4012360 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4012361 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4012362 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4012363 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4012364 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4012365 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4012366 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4012367 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4012368 just so you all know we did set a record
4012369 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4012370 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4012371 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4012372 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4012373 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4012374 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4012375 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
4012376 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
4012377 going negative against democrat barack obama isnt just a campaign strategy for republican john mccain
4012378 top the aug 17 new york times hardcover nonfiction bestseller list
4012379 lashes out at barack obama and alleges among other things that the politician has a secret radical islamic agenda
4012380 whether they like him or oppose him readers want to hear more about barack obama

4012388 we want to ensure that all champions trophy matches attract sizeable crowds and would take all possible measures for it
4012389 to that end it was agreed that representatives who have attended the latest briefings and demonstrations in lahore and karachi will visit stakeholders who have expressed reservations to let them know of the safety and security measures on the ground
4012390 the results of those meetings will be fed back to me and also to icc vice president sharad pawar and icc ceo lorgat on august 20 so we can make a further assessment of the comfort levels of our participating members
4012391 we are committed to a safe and secure champions trophy we believe these visits and the feedbacks will play a major role in achieving those ends
4012392 during the recently completed asia cup there were no fixtures at rawalpindi and that didnt allow us opportunity to check the security arrangements so there has been no way for us to formulate an opinion on the venue
4012393 we believe that by excluding rawalpindi and using just two venues both of them successful hosts during asia cup it will remove doubt allow a further concentration of resources and improve comfort levels for all stakeholders in the event visit to pakistan has allowed task team to deal in reality instead of theories or perceptions
4012394 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
4012395 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4012396 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4012397 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
4012398 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
4012399 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
4012400 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
4012401 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
4012402 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
4012403 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4012404 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
4012405 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
4012406 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4012407 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4012408 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4012409 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4012410 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4012411 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4012412 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4012413 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4012414 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4012415 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4012416 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4012417 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4012418 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4012419 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4012420 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4012421 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4012422 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
4012423 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4012424 the people of connecticut deserve to have the chance and the choice to vote for ralph nader should that be the candidate of their choice
4012425 he did not help in 2000 and hes not going to this year i guess hes a closet republican he helps elect republicans
4012426 theoretically its always possible for someone to get one vote that could make a difference
4012427 it could go down a little or it could go up a little
4012428 if hes got the support and hes qualified good luck to him
4012429 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4012430 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4012431 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
4012432 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
4012433 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
4012434 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
4012435 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
4012436 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
4012437 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
4012438 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
4012439 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
4012440 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
4012441 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
4012442 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
4012443 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
4012444 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
4012445 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
4012446 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
4012447 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
4012448 when do we bring you into a project and why
4012449 why do you make a sitemap instead of the technology team
4012450 why do you suddenly get to tell me what to design if im a designer and youre not
4012451 have you ever noticed that mac users tell you what they love about their system but windows users tell you what they hate why is that
4012452 ever purchased a brand new apple mac book or macbook pro etc what was your experience like from opening the packaging looking over the very simple setup getting started page to powering it up and logging in for the first time
4012453 id love them unconditionally if they wanted to id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
4012454 shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling
4012455 god has a way of taking something bad and turning it into something good
4012456 i see him all the time at least once a week
4012457 who could have sex the longest i think thats an event i can do well in
4012458 the former friends star has been unable to find love since her divorce four years ago from brad pitt
4012459 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
4012460 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
4012461 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
4012462 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
4012463 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
4012464 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
4012465 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
4012466 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
4012467 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
4012468 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
4012469 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
4012470 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
4012471 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
4012472 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
4012473 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
4012474 there you go again thats exactly the politics of division that has led us to where we are in washington
4012475 the political brain the role of emotion in deciding the fate of the nation
4012476 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
4012477 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
4012478 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
4012479 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
4012480 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
4012481 the white house is intensely interested because there may be a legality that has constitutional consequences
4012482 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4012483 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4012484 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4012485 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4012486 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4012487 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4012488 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4012489 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4012490 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4012491 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4012492 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4012493 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4012494 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4012495 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4012496 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4012497 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4012498 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4012499 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4012500 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4012501 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4012502 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4012503 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4012504 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4012505 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4012506 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4012507 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4012508 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4012509 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4012510 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4012511 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4012512 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4012513 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4012514 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4012515 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4012516 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4012517 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4012518 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4012519 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4012520 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4012521 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4012522 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4012523 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4012524 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4012525 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4012526 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4012527 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4012528 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4012529 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4012530 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4012531 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4012532 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4012533 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4012534 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4012535 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4012536 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4012537 i think she should definitely get paid as much as either of us is getting paid
4012538 her father created the show it just seems wrong if thats the case i dont know what really happened because i havent talked to her i would like to talk to her
4012539 what it means to be young and frustrated in modern japan
4012540 i see him all the time at least once a week
4012541 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years
4012542 they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
4012543 i really didnt know about blackface and minstrels and all that so i had to read about that whole history
4012544 i have to admit he was pretty good at it
4012545 he stayed in character on the set and i had to keep my mom away from him she thought he was don cheadle
4012546 while the hotels clientele is an obvious part of this world im more interested in the downstairs part of upstairs downstairs
4012547 id love to have had clint at this festival im a huge fan of his directorial work sadly one cant get everything one wants universal studios decided not to offer the film to us
4012548 id be really surprised if he didnt get a best actor nomination for this film
4012549 i dont believe china was treated fairly and now there are reasons to ask tough questions about the next olympics whether its vancouver or london
4012550 something like how did you find the opening ceremonies is this your first time to china those kinds of questions
4012551 when i came here two years ago we didnt even have space for investigative reports for instance now we have that i know we are regarded as a communist party mouthpiece but we dont see it that way
4012552 and im going to continue to work there until it gets even better
4012553 the vancouver slogan is our time to shine but theres always some dark under the light
4012554 there is an immediacy to the film that was not under control since i had nine months to get the whole thing together
4012555 all these things from my life kept coming out and i didnt have time to write 45 drafts i didnt have time to filter
4012556 one time i asked my grandmother how to say certain words in her language and she started crying because she thought i was making fun of her
4012557 as you get older and gain awareness about things like residential schools you understand the political currents but as a kid you experience these things as emotional
4012558 i was behind the scenes holding the reflector card back then but now i shoot and direct a lot of those kinds of documentaries
4012559 i was constantly immersed in the aboriginal political world watching communities form circle discussions and talking to elders i came to understand the balance many urban aboriginals struggle to attain
4012560 i drew on my own life and exaggerated scenarios i might find myself in
4012561 in the city you see churches and mosques and other cultural places but for aboriginal people the visual reminders of your identity are supposed to be outside the city
4012562 but many aboriginals are born and raised in cities so where is our place the film is never going to answer that but its something we need to talk more about
4012563 we found ways for her to identify personally with things jolene was saying and then she could go off page
4012564 i didnt know if anyone was going to like it its so personal to put your individual struggle into a film
4012565 this is what i find so ironic about life is that by going so personal it becomes universal
4012566 these items mean a lot to the community and they mean a lot to the park
4012567 the reason that it didnt get sold or recycled was that we had some really excellent coverage by the media also the vpd were right on it
4012568 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4012569 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4012570 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4012571 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4012572 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4012573 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4012574 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4012575 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4012576 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4012577 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4012578 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4012579 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4012580 we love peace we love home but if anyone dares to infringe upon our peaceful home we will render him to death
4012581 our peoples republic is maturing our leader mao zedong guides the way forward
4012582 nobody gets any pleasure being in a stadium where there are people outside dying to get in and theyre not able to
4012583 i think youre going to be very impressed with the way were going to go about it
4012584 bears do have this excellent sense of smell thats linked to their very good memory once they associate food with being inside a house theyre going to associate every house with food and we just cant take that risk we cant let a bear a big strong wild animal whos accustomed to food like that roam
4012585 this bear probably was still exploring new sources of food
4012586 in this hot weather people are leaving their doors and windows open not only is that a problem for crime its a problem for bears
4012587 theres a lot of people who dont consider the consequences of their actions
4012588 therell always be bears in the lower mainland therell always be bears throughout the province
4012589 i have watched the organization grow and progress as a very successful cancer control and research enterprise
4012590 so it is with a mix of regret and anticipation for the future that i have decided to leave
4012591 in the last eight years theres been a lot of really wonderful planning and building of work and repertoire so the company is now poised
4012592 its time for us to go out and once again start touring internationally and nationally after weve been sort of hibernating
4012593 there is a strong classical core to it but it is really sort of pushed along with a contemporary energy and a very powerful spirit
4012594 it is undoubtedly a joy to see that a work of yours has a life
4012595 ballet may be an art form that truly touches the heart but it also touches the wallet
4012596 the board has accepted the resignation of paul battershill effective immediately as a result of a loss of confidence in his leadership of the police department
4012597 we felt that under the circumstances the 15 000 cost for his legal fees was appropriate
4012598 its now up to the office of the police complaints commissioner to review the findings and determine if a public hearing is warranted
4012599 the process with the police act is still under way
4012600 resignations basically remove any claims the employee may have for severance or restitution
4012601 and once the employer accepts the resignation theyre hard pressed to make any claims against the employee
4012602 am primit rapid dou goluri dup care ne am revenit am avut o serie de ocazii importante prin arda i lincoln plus golurile marcate de nonda n ultimul sfert de or s a v zut c nu am jucat p n acum dec t n meciuri de preg tire am fost obosi i sunt convins c n meciul retur vom fi mai n form p n atunci vom mai juca supercupa turciei i un meci n campionat
4012603 there are a lot of patients out there who are taking statins who could save a lot of money by splitting a larger tablet or perhaps even moving to a lower cost statin and splitting a larger tablet of that statin and save even more money
4012604 typically the difference between a split tablet where theres a little bit more on one half of the tablet than on the next fragment it cant possibly make any meaningful difference in terms of the drugs effect
4012605 but it definitely can to the users pocketbook its very much like buying any other commodity in bulk whether you buy cereal or flower or rice or sugar most people will buy it in a larger size
4012606 if one is going to take a drug for a few weeks say an antibiotic if you pay 35 compared with 10 its not usually a big deal
4012607 but if youre going to take it for years or potentially the rest of your life its a huge deal where the cash out of your pocket is after tax income
4012608 yes its absolutely wonderful if youre looking at drugs where you dont need the exact exact exact dose where you can be off by a little bit and its fine
4012609 absolutely industry knows about this and theyre definitely thinking okay what do we do about it
4012610 i perceived they were taking us away from rehabilitation and therapeutic programming and deeper into policy that was more about containment
4012611 women didnt use bad language around the children they were gentle
4012612 she wouldnt be here with me i wouldnt be where i am i would probably be out using still
4012613 because if she was taken from me from the beginning i would miss that bond
4012614 our staff are not trained to supervise infants and theyre not trained in infant first aid or anything
4012615 if something went wrong and we didnt respond appropriately we just couldnt risk putting an infant in that situation
4012616 theyll give birth to their child in a hospital theyll go back to jail and go back to the stuff theyve known before
4012617 i stepped up to the plate you know like was i going to do this or not was i going to get on with this or not
4012618 even when i wanted to screw up i had to think about something other than myself
4012619 a lot of healing went on for me in the six months i was in there with those babies
4012620 these children that are allowed to be there are the focus of much love and care and attention
4012621 there is little resentment to us coming in and taking over
4012622 the u k model is probably the one that canada should move to because its a little less costly
4012623 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4012624 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4012625 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4012626 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4012627 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4012628 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4012629 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4012630 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4012631 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

4012636 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4012637 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4012638 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4012639 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4012640 im considering this season a washout ill start all over next year
4012641 i wasnt throwing as many strikes in the fifth walked a couple of guys but mostly i wasnt making the pitches i needed to make
4012642 after michaels home run the rest of the inning got away from me
4012643 if im able to get the third inning before doumit hit the double and were still a 2 1 ballgame but i wasnt able to finish off the inning
4012644 those walks in the fifth by fogg is what set it up for the big boys to come up in the fifth
4012645 we know fogg is going to give you six or six and a fraction
4012646 he gave up the home run michaels and that made it 2 1 no problem but then he lost command of the strike zone and it turned into a big inning
4012647 there is now so much information available to students and pupils and a lot of them dont seem to understand that they need to show where theyve got things from they understand that if theyre copying something from a book or a journal they have to acknowledge that theres less appreciation that its just the same when information comes from a website
4012648 while the internet is an amazing resource kids need to be empowered with the information literacy skills to be able to use the internet properly
4012649 im using jolbert cabrera in left field because i need another right handed bat against left hander paul maholm who is tough
4012650 dickerson had a little problem with left handers in the minors
4012651 with a younger player you have to protect him and his confidence and try to put him in a better possible situation to succeed dickerson will be back in there tonight against ian snell
4012652 i liked him in spring training you know and i thought he would be a very good complement to this team and he has been
4012653 i think thats the ball i hit for the double
4012654 so youre getting micah owings in the adam dunn trade
4012655 a lot of things can be made in china and other countries much cheaper thats a fact what is unknown though is quality of the product and quality is what it always boils down to in the end
4012656 the oil on the beaches is still there affecting the animals

4012661 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4012662 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4012663 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4012664 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4012665 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4012666 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4012667 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4012668 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4012669 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4012670 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4012671 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4012672 sorry guys back home that i couldnt bring you home a medal but i gave it my all
4012673 my first first 50 metres i think i took too many strokes
4012674 i wanted to take 15 and i took 16 and i think that set me up to not finish well
4012675 its the second fastest ive ever been so i cant complain too much
4012676 ucs review committees cited legitimate reasons for rejecting the texts not because they contained religious viewpoints but because they omitted important topics in science and history and failed to teach critical thinking
4012677 not because they contained religious viewpoints but because they omitted important topics in science and history and failed to teach critical thinking
4012678 if scientific conclusions contradict the word of god the conclusions are wrong
4012679 watch the classes you take now as some of these arent accepted by most academics and wont help you in the future

4012698 and whilst jimmy had won sticks duties with german rock outfit scorpions the ultimate day job kottak took tentative steps in creating what im listening to today

4012701 this drug has great potential to treat not only alcoholism but other stress related disorders as well
4012702 its like you put the key in a lock but dont turn it
4012703 then you break the key off so no one can use it
4012704 the euphoria you experience with alcohol is extremely rapid and mostly happens within the first 15 to 30 minutes after your first drink

4012717 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
4012718 i do not see there is anything wrong with it
4012719 you have to be sure that the performers and the song it is at the highest level
4012720 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect
4012721 this program was implemented as a means to keep these kids busy and out of trouble as well as give them a sense of citizenship and teach them about the importance of why they need to keep their environment clean
4012722 this program keeps them busy and makes them some money
4012723 i think the parents love it because all the kids are actually out doing something together working toward community goals and leaving their differences aside forming a good community
4012724 i would like to see this as a success story and implemented throughout iraq in future years to come
4012725 it was hard to sleep because of the painful thoughts buzzing around in my head like a swarm of angry bees no not bees hornets bees died after the first sting these were the same painful thoughts stinging me over and over again

4012730 part of it is a higher fertility rate for some of the minority groups hispanics in particular
4012731 those groups also tend to be more of the childbearing age non hispanic white people tend to be a little bit older
4012732 thus one in three u s residents would be hispanic
4012733 theyre in a higher mortality rate nonminority groups tend to be older and dying off faster
4012734 whos going to do the jobs that are characteristically held right now by certain types of people

4012737 we all have the potential to fall in love a thousand times in our lifetime its easy but there are certain people you love who do something else they define how you classify what love is supposed to feel like these are the most important people in your life and youll meet maybe four or five of these people over the span of 80 years but theres still one more tier to all this there is always one person you love who becomes that definition it usually happens retrospectively but it always happens eventually this is the person who unknowingly sets the template for what you will always love about other people even if some of those qualities are self destructive and unreasonable you will remember having conversations with this person that never actually happened you will recall sexual trysts with this person that never technically occurred this is because the individual who embodies your personal definition of love does not really exist the person is real and the feelings are real but you create the context and the context is everything the person who defines your understanding of love is not inherently different than anyone else and theyre often just the person you happen to meet the first time you really really want to love someone but that person still wins they win and you lose because for the rest of your life they will control how you feel about everyone else
4012738 en ver n v n xente con m is carencias escolares non presentan d bidas concretas hai que empezar con eles desde cero e concentrar en dous meses o temario de todo un curso

4012746 from what ive seen most are in crates or cages
4012747 she put a crate on a wagon and decorated it
4012748 it was birds and roars and monkeys making the little ooh ooh ooh sounds
4012749 theres a lot of thought that is put into the parade order
4012750 i think the bagpipers were behind the cats one year and i guess a lot of cats were freaking out because they had the loud music behind them we make sure now to keep the cats far away from any music
4012751 they were kind of nervous they stayed in one spot but they let people reach their hands into the crate and pet them
4012752 we eliminated the clowns division and replaced it with athletes
4012753 last year we had just one lonely child in clowns
4012754 this program was implemented as a means to keep these kids busy and out of trouble as well as give them a sense of citizenship and teach them about the importance of why they need to keep their environment clean

4012758 we have crews engaged to deliver supplies to those in need and others on standby ready to go at a moments notice if called upon to go in and provide relief
4012759 weve been called on to provide relief before air mobility is a unique asset for our nation
4012760 our airlift capability also allowed our nation to keep its promise to georgia
4012761 general schwartz and i have several issues to address together the nuclear enterprise of course care for our wounded warriors our intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance posture the acquisition process modernization and recapitalization and of course continued support for the global war on terror
4012762 my pledge to all today is that the air force will keep the promise to our teammates our families and to all our partners who rely on us everyday
4012763 precision and reliability is our standard regardless of job or specialty and we will return the vigor and rigor to all the processes and missions for which we have been entrusted
4012764 we will train organize and inspect to that standard the bottom line
4012765 we have a lot of work to do but we have a lot to be proud of as well
4012766 in those areas where others have found fault we are going to work with a vengeance and we will remain the worlds finest air force
4012767 obviously not getting through the tanker protest was a major blow to our acquisition process so i supported the defense secretarys decision to move the next steps in that source selection process over from the air force to the office of the secretary of defense
4012768 i wont be satisfied until we get through these major source selections and potential protests that may follow with a clean bill of health
4012769 we are looking at the new level that the secretary of defense had set the main thing for us is not the number but obviously the mix in terms of what new missions and requirements need to be covered in that 330 000
4012770 we are going to put 14 000 or so difference where we need them most
4012771 the cyber mission is important and it will go forward for the air force
4012772 the issue is in what context form and national framework this is not just about the air force it has to fit with strategic command and the broader national security community and were going to make sure all those pieces fit together as we proceed
4012773 we want to make sure we remain in the role of consumer and not perceived by others as a producer the air force is fundamentally a consumer of energy
4012774 if were going to be involved with this cooperative work going forward were going to make sure were in partnership with the department of energy and other federal agencies that need to be involved
4012775 our sole goal is to safely and rapidly deliver humanitarian aid to georgia to alleviate human suffering and save lives
4012776 we will continue to support this humanitarian mission until the host nation and the u s state department determine that it is no longer needed
4012777 thank you so much for helping us in this great time of need these supplies will surely save lives
4012778 we are very pleased that the joint military community eucom u s army europe and u s air forces in europe have the opportunity to provide logistical support to bring these humanitarian supplies here
4012779 eucom forces will remain ready to support as further needs are assessed
4012780 receiving reaccreditation further solidifies the air forces museum as one of national prominence and prestige
4012781 the commitment of the board staff volunteers and foundation to uphold the highest standards of the museum practice is shown with this award
4012782 this is a great example of the capability to let our airmen submit their forms and have a systematic visibility on their status throughout the chain of command
4012783 commanders could have reports in coordination without knowing their status
4012784 now guard and reserve commanders can know exactly where all their reports are by looking on vpc gr
4012785 we wanted to create a system where any of our customers could log in and request any service we provide at their convenience from anywhere in the world
4012786 then we could get back to them with a response within a reasonable timeframe
4012787 the 20 year and mortgage letters process was our first process that didnt require anyone to do anything on the back end the computer did all the work for us
4012788 these letters are examples of tier 0 service at its finest
4012789 the customer knows what he wants and the computer automatically gives it to him
4012790 with where we are around the world in many different and varied areas giving our members access is crucial so they know and have a comfortable feeling that their records are right
4012791 personnel services delivery transformation is helping us keep pace in line with the ops tempo of todays world and how we deploy around the world
4012792 as developers we have total control over vpc gr applications and our case management system
4012793 if an urgent change is needed based on customer feedback mandated changes or to fix a problem we have the local talent and flexibility to make these changes quickly
4012794 very few programs meet all of their customers needs when they first hit the street well be prepared to provide development support for customer processes during the transition to dimhrs and migration to the new consolidated case management system
4012795 all of the online applications were creating are helping us get comfortable with using online transactions which will continue to increase as the military transitions to dihmrs
4012796 we want to make is as easy as possible for our customers
4012797 as we receive feedback from the field we evaluate it to see if there is anything we can do to make it easier for our customers as a whole

4012800 what about the queen f k the queen and 50 000 courtiers were trampled in the rush for in those days the kings word was law
4012801 get your mind out of the gutter youre blocking my snorkel
4012802 cats have pointy ears and we like to pet them but if they looked like frogs wed realize what mean bastards they are
4012803 just the very fact that i have myspace makes them think well maybe we can talk to this guy and open the lines of communication
4012804 i realized this is a major way of communication for them
4012805 you cant argue with people whose intentions are trying to protect children but the simple fact is you take these people who prey on children and they are going to find a way to do it whether its over facebook or not
4012806 there are so many kids who are stubborn against anything teachers say who are struggling in the classroom and refuse to ask for help
4012807 when its so hard to reach these kids why would you remove any of the weapons at your disposal to make a difference
4012808 as an educator there is a line of demarcation between you and your student
4012809 its a line that you cannot come close to let alone step over
4012810 its a sad thing but with teaching you are going to have people who are attracted to the profession because of easy availability of kids
4012811 when you get lee martin from manchester united and robert earnshaw a welsh international that was the difference
4012812 forest play football the way it should be played and they did look a very good side
4012813 im disappointed with the scoreline but forest are a fantastic side and deserve the win
4012814 the difference was that they had the quality in the final third and we just didnt have that quality when we needed it
4012815 we go away smiling but we were at home against a league 2 side so we were expected to win
4012816 this clearly goes against the conditions of their permit which should only centre on their religion and religious activities it will earn the herald another warning letter and probably even a suspension
4012817 the editorial is only asking people to pray for a just and fair by election cant we christians ask fellow christians to pray is that against the law
4012818 the moment i touch ground i am so alone in the sky i have many friends i follow them and they follow me i understand them and they i in the wonders of the blue sublime i fear not infection from hate nor quarrel from misunderstanding it is when i touch ground i become ripe with fear as a small child so i curl up and away for i am frightened in sky i am not fearful i have been there many times and know many people on ground i stay huddled up trembling in fear waiting for the moment i might touch the stars oh what a weakling i have become
4012819 one should not fear others sweetheart all things touch the infinite people all but grab a mere handful of it and call it their lives but one must never let slip the knowledge that what everyone grabs from is the same so all people no matter how their lives are lived no matter how radically different they are derive from the same thing they just happened to grab it at different parts or in bigger or smaller handfuls why does one think man himself is the most social of all creatures for he craves more of this infinite he seeks out others for they complete the pattern bringing man closer and closer to the big picture that which he can only see through vague notions and flighting visions men are greedy always wanting more then what they can hold i am fairly certain that maybe this is why you are fearful that it comes from mans selfish desires
4012820 what of me what will become of me when i am a grounded creature shall i become selfish i dont want to be that way i feel myself becoming that way as we speak its been getting harder and harder to give tell me father is it wrong to be selfish and greedy
4012821 but tell me how is one to know what is the right and what is the wrong
4012822 when we go downstairs for breakfast im gonna say something with hell and you say something with ass
4012823 you can just stay there until i let you out
4012824 just think how nice it will be to look at it when you are all grown up and say theres jennifer shes a lawyer or thats michael hes a doctor
4012825 how did you ever get a name like sipho mthetwa being a chinese man

4012833 schoolyard heroes release is one of the best most hair raising records out of the northwest all year
4012834 the production on abominations is pristine and mature the songs teeming with sinister chords and spine tingly good vocals
4012835 schoolyard heroes delivers to those who want great musicianship and horrifyingly epic lyrics
4012836 usually a band will either have a lead singer whose charisma carries the band or solid instrumentation that makes up for the inadequacies of the lead bands that accomplish skill in both areas are few and far between
4012837 the local 19 year old divas vocal acrobatics could turn heads in a vacuum possibly all the way around
4012838 i started singing when i was 8 or at least thats when i started getting vocal lessons
4012839 when i was in high school i was in this play with a girl who said that if i wanted to develop my higher ranges i might want to work with her vocal coach who teaches opera and i was up for it so i started studying opera as well

4012842 in the situations i have witnessed there is no divine intervention all we have is each other we create our own problems and it us up to us to solve them
4012843 we work very closely with the police force and as a result we have a very good working relationship
4012844 maybe thats why there doesnt seem to be such a gulf with us compared to other clubs
4012845 there is a good mixture of youth and experience around the place now
4012846 as one of the senior lads i have been drumming it into everyone else how important the start to the season will be
4012847 the stats show over the years that if you start poorly youll be punished somewhere along the line if you look at our first three fixtures there is a chance we can give ourselves a decent head start and a chance of a better season
4012848 we have it with dvd we had it with vhs we have it with televisions in the sense that for the most part every tv is capable of broadcasting the same signal
4012849 so what do we lose by having it for game consoles
4012850 social media gives ordinary people the opportunity to publish anything anywhere this has had a massive impact how we perceive interact with and consume media in general be it traditional or new
4012851 as a result businesses are faced with a new set of challenges and opportunities around digitally empowered socially networked customers who before now could easily be dictated to or ignored
4012852 social media is simply just the next step in how we engage with each other and the world around us it is no more fascinating than email was in the late 80s or the telephone was hundreds of years ago hype negates perspective which prevents people from seeing any value in the evolution of media
4012853 quite frankly i was in the right place at the right time

4012858 wherever on this planet ideals of personal freedom and dignity apply there you will find the cultural inheritance of england
4012859 there are many things in life more worthwhile than money one is to be brought up in this our england which is still the envy of less happy lands
4012860 cold heart and bloody hand now rule the english land
4012861 england has already lost the war it is only a matter of having the intelligence to admit it
4012862 bind her grind her burn her with fire cast her ashes into the sea she shall escape she shall aspire she shall arise to make men free she shall arise in a sacred scorn lighting the lives that are yet unborn spirit supernal splendor eternal england
4012863 england with all thy faults i love thee still my country and while yet a nook is left where english minds and manners may be found shall be constrained to love thee
4012864 they that have the power to hurt and will do none they rightly do inherit heavens graces
4012865 true heroism is remarkably sober very undramatic it is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost but the urge to serve others at whatever cost
4012866 if heaven is about to entrust an important mission to a man it begins by filling his heart with bitterness and by confusing his powers of perception and overturning his plans it forces him to exert his bone and muscle it forces him to endure hunger and all manner of sufferings when the man emerges triumphantly over all these trials and tribulations he is then capable of accomplishing what would have been impossible for him to do before
4012867 imagine if you had a group of american students who were high school dropouts and they went to japan and performed a series of short plays in japanese
4012868 every student is on stage and performs in one of these
4012869 every student also runs lights or builds sets or designs t shirts or works backstage
4012870 they do everything its amazing when they get their standing ovation at the end of the performance theyve earned it
4012871 the material that we perform is far more adventurous than anything you would see at harlequin or capital playhouse or even theater artists olympia
4012872 i dont mean to slam my friends at those places but this has always been a free show its not about subscribers or ticket sales
4012873 thematically its more adventurous and theatrically its more adventurous this is all about the process of doing the show and then having an exchange with the audience
4012874 usually the hero and heroine meet at the very beginning of a romance book but ms
4012875 she finely portrays the characters the plot is certainly believable the suspense and danger is real in conclusion one night in memphis is a fantastic read one the reader will remember and i highly recommend it

4012886 the only thing we know about the future is that it will be different
4012887 this is our fifth year of putting on free shows each year weve grown in the number of free shows and the audience has grown with it
4012888 weve got music weve got drama weve even got a 78 year old stripping granny at one of the venues a bit of everything just like fringe itself
4012889 its a festival i really want to be a part of but i cant afford to do it if i do it the other way
4012890 actually i would be less comfortable if i were in a venue playing to four people but charging 15 a ticket
4012891 we all know each other at the venues and we all go and see each other and support the shows

4012893 non conformism is never going to be popular in a mass movement non conformists are simply people who wont stick to the message but as the gop looks to be increasingly marginalized in the coming election i wonder if this wont lead to the rise of the quirky conservative this election marked the rise of ron paul who comes off as about the oddest gadfly of them all huckabee wasnt exactly mainstream either and their nominee john mccain is a little off as well and is having trouble fitting into the gop straitjacket from a more philosophical perspective this simply seems to be the embodiment of the disconnect between a profound respect for the standing order and a distrust of centralized state authority as bob dylan said youve got to serve somebody law and order conservatives although i dont if that term exactly applies but take it for what it is have acquiesced the distrust of centralized authority in exchange for a standing order crunchy cons have focused on self observance to a higher order beyond the grasp of the state suffice to say this divide has been going on for a long time
4012894 strong and well positioned to take advantage of future opportunities
4012895 this strategic cost cutting exercise will ensure a stable business model which will allow us to expand relatively rapidly when the market returns to normal

4012901 we are ahead of our business plan in terms of the numbers we said we would deliver to advertisers
4012902 there is a tremendous appetite for big event television of which the olympics is the biggest
4012903 our ratings for athens were up over sydney and sports in general seems immune to erosion in viewership and keeps bucking the trend a great example of that are some of the recent events on nbc like the stanley cup final wimbledon and u s open which all showed ratings increases
4012904 i know that with the people of durham supporting me the walk will be a great success
4012905 every penny counts and we can beat childhood leukaemia if we work together to raise as much money as possible
4012906 i am looking forward to coming to durham and meeting those who have worked hard in their fundraising
4012907 we know that families in some communities still use the corner shop on a daily basis for their food and other household goods it is therefore essential we take healthy eating options to these stores and reach those families who are at the greatest risk of poor health due to a poor diet consumer habits are shifting people shop around at different outlets several times a week so its important that people have the opportunity to buy fresh fruit and vegetables where it is convenient for them
4012908 we are delighted the department of health has decided to launch this project here
4012909 the national fruit and vegetable scheme aimed at four to six year olds already operates in more than 99 per cent of the eligible schools in our region and several schools have chosen to extend it to key stage two children as well
4012910 but we still have consistently low uptake figures for the five a day initiative to encourage more people to eat fruit and vegetables
4012911 this report has got nothing to do with the conservative party this is an independent think tank it has charitable status i think this report is complete rubbish
4012912 it has produced some good work in the past but this is a very bad report sometimes they come up with good ideas and sometimes they come up with bad ideas this is a bad one
4012913 i think there is a resurgence going on in britains northern cities
4012914 it certainly will not become conservative party policy conservative party policy will continue the good work of regenerating cities right across england including northern cities
4012915 it was not by chance that the conservative spring conference came to gateshead this year it was a recognition of how much has been achieved on tyneside and of what the north east has to offer
4012916 which is why this weeks report from the policy exchange
4012917 the job of political thinktanks is to put forward challenging ideas but politicians should only listen when they are talking sense and in this case it most definitely was not
4012918 in fact far from thinking that northern towns and cities have no future i think just the opposite that is why it is nonsensical to suggest that to have a future people and business needs to head south
4012919 liverpool manchester newcastle and leeds have successful financial services sectors there are good universities which will provide great opportunities for local technological innovation and there are strong multinational and family businesses
4012920 in too many places the money has been badly spent
4012921 but that is a failure of policy and not geography the problems of gang crime you find in some parts of the north are little different to the problems you find on the streets of south london
4012922 she had to walk home on her own you do not put a 13 year old girl in that position there was no credit on her phone
4012923 it was dark by the time she got home and i was worried sick the really annoying thing is the bus used to come at 8 50pm but they changed it so it is now at the stop at 9 02pm
4012924 there is nothing on the terms and conditions of the bus pass that says it is not valid after 9pm
4012925 she was not in a group she was by herself
4012926 i have bought her a weekly pass every week for the last year and there has never been any literature or anything that has come with it
4012927 i bought her it thinking i have got piece of mind that she is getting home safely and then this happens
4012928 the publicity that is put out with the ticket makes it clear that it is not valid after 9pm i am sorry she only discovered it now
4012929 i was cycling one of the routes in hamsterley and i was coming to the bottom of the forest and came off the road and was thrown into the trees
4012930 i did not have any signal on my phone but i knew something was wrong so i drank the energy drinks i had and set off back home when i got home i thought i would make the best use of my free bus pass so waited for the next bus to darlington
4012931 by that time i had got in contact with my wife so i told her i would meet her at the hospital
4012932 i should really thank the chap who gave me a lift though because he really helped me
4012933 some just say why didnt you call me you idiot i would have come and taken you to hospital
4012934 some joke that its a good excuse for getting out of rotary club meetings

4012976 anyone that knew her would agree she had a way with making people laugh
4012977 maybe by carrying the torch im meant to help people realize they should live life to the fullest

4012979 she was not the same person physically but she didnt let that bother her
4012980 even at 455 a month which is really reasonable its difficult to make my monthly rent
4012981 is that when people need us most thats when we have the hardest time meeting the need
4012982 i dont want to be a victim and i dont blame others

4012984 develop annual academic and functional goals designed to meet the students educational needs and enable him to make progress
4012985 these kids who dont get intervention end up being in the criminal justice system
4012986 its not in everybodys best interest to ignore these people
4012987 the other thing thats sad about this is statistically had sean gotten intervention it would be extremely unlikely that he would be partially verbal at this point or be posing a danger to himself or others
4012988 its kind of a tough situation the law provides that certain services need to be provided but in some locales it just may not be possible
4012989 in a way its almost an unfortunate situation for everyone
4012990 you have a lot of parents that dont know about their rights and dont litigate you have a lot of kids that arent getting these services
4012991 if schools truly cant provide the services it is the obligation of the school to pick up the tab
4012992 it brings us together as a group kind of like therapy to see something growing and flourishing

4012996 the city is taking a huge step forward in figuring out how to address the housing crisis
4012997 create another nail in the coffin of the housing market at the worst possible time
4012998 this was all about getting some assurances in the law for the people who may vote for this in good faith
4012999 i want to convey to your readers its a good day because the logjam has been broken here
4013000 we were just doing our duties that our regions have a fair and equitable distribution
4013001 honest to goodness i swear to you that for me it has nothing to do with anything but the issue itself i have great respect for the mayor there was no motivation im going to stick it to him or whatever
4013002 he did not stop his murderous acts voluntarily but because of the heroic acts of the neighbor
4013003 i had a bad feeling at first i wasnt sure if the neighbors were kidding around i thought maybe the kids who live east of me had gotten hurt
4013004 even the police said nothing like this ever happens here
4013005 he ran over there and said drop the knife right now and the attacker did
4013006 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
4013007 this is a broader social issue that goes beyond home depot and the solution is certainly more complicated than placing mandates on businesses
4013008 all of this is flying in the face of what the city is supposed to be doing in terms of upholding the law
4013009 i am going to vomit who gave you the right to destroy the constitution and take impeachment off the table

4013016 one million iraqis are dead five thousand americans are dead you have destroyed the first second fourth fifth and eighth amendments

4013021 so you dont know what you took basically somebody said this is an ecstasy pill here take it and you took it yeah
4013022 so that is one of the main dangers not knowing what they are taking
4013023 its seems not only can a rusting former superpower lurch into a sovereign nation intent on undermining any sense of safety liberty and peace it can demand that its actions be sanctioned by the entire civilized world with the blessing of la france

4013068 im just trying to go out there and help this team win in any way possible scoring runs definitely helps you relax and go out there and do the job
4013069 but he got through it made pitches when he needed to and stayed right on it
4013070 any time you get a lead like that for a pitcher it allows them the freedom to know they can make a mistake and get away with it
4013071 any time you give a pitcher like cc that comfort level youre in pretty good shape
4013072 sabathia made some pitches we couldnt break through and they did that was sort of the difference in the game
4013073 having guys on base is always exciting because you can make things happen
4013074 sabathia has been everything we thought he would be when hes out there we know things are going to go well hes pitching as well as anybody in the national league right now
4013075 im just trying to make pitches when i need to
4013076 i dont really have room for error there and im just trying to get us out of the inning it worked out
4013077 look matey i know a dead parrot when i see one and im looking at one right now
4013078 no no hes not dead hes hes resting remarkable bird the norwegian blue isnt it aye beautiful plumage
4013079 that parrot is definitely deceased and when i purchased it not half an hour ago you assured me that its total lack of movement was due to it being tired and shagged out following a prolonged squawk
4013080 due to the stressed condition of the credit market as a whole and the unprecedented speed at which rumors and speculation travel and echo through the modern financial media environment the rumors and speculation became a self fulfilling prophecy
4013081 do you believe that your management team has any responsibility for the companys collapse
4013082 i just simply have not been able to come up with anything even with the benefit of hindsight
4013083 i want the witnesses to know and others that as a bottom line consideration i happen to believe that this was the right decision
4013084 you know if there was a magic wand to wave id be waving it
4013085 i think that if there was a magic wand and say okay drop price id do that
4013086 theyre looking to their elected leaders in congress for action
4013087 congress continues to block provisions congress needs to clear away obstacles congress is considering a massive bloated farm bill congress needs to do more i ask congress to do its part
4013088 gas prices have gone up foreclosures have gone up there have been layoffs news just this morning that consumer confidence is down yet again
4013089 were you premature in saying that the u s economy is not in a recession
4013090 unfortunately clintons fantastic invention of a sniper raked landing is only one in a growing list of instances in which she has exaggerated her role as first lady
4013091 clinton has credited herself with creating the state childrens health insurance program and helping to pass the family and medical leave act like the tuzla story both of these claims turn out to false
4013092 raising serious questions not just about the rationale for senator clintons campaign but about her willingness to adhere to the truth
4013093 whats your advice to the average american who is hurting now facing the prospect of 4 a gallon gasoline a lot of people facing
4013094 a number of analysts are predicting 4 a gallon gasoline
4013095 you just said the price of gasoline may be up to 4 a gallon or some expert told you that
4013096 there were those who were saying that north carolina would be a game changer in this election but today what north carolina decided is that the only game that needs changing is the one in washington d c
4013097 i want to start by congratulating senator clinton on what appears to be her victory in the great state of indiana
4013098 this has been one of the longest most closely fought contests in american history
4013099 im not used to having to work with this much breast
4013100 first i have a fairly high pain tolerance and second you have a baby sucking on that for a year and a little pinch is the least of your worries
4013101 as we hold this hearing grocers and restaurants nationwide have been pulling tomatoes from the shelves and menus
4013102 i tried to get a blt sandwich in the cloakroom yesterday and no tomato
4013103 we can see tomatoes spinach grapes mushrooms seafood and dozens of other items which have gone on to poison and sicken the american consumer
4013104 jars of peter pan peanut butter containing salmonella cans of green beans containing botulism spinach tainted with e coli poisoned pot pies
4013105 the largest meat recall in the history of our country salmonella was found in puffed rice and puffed wheat cereals tainted cantaloupes
4013106 the longer you sit on this committee the more depressed you get because the issues never get resolved and crop up again and again
4013107 because your health and safety is our first priority we have followed the fda warning by removing the tomato varieties of concern
4013108 fresh produce like spinach how many outbreaks have we had with that
4013109 the 50th woman to leave this earth is orbiting overhead
4013110 although we werent able to shatter that highest hardest glass ceiling this time thanks to you its got about 18 million cracks in it
4013111 and the light is shining through like never before filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time
4013112 do all we can to help elect barack obama the next president of the united states
4013113 i would die and slit my wrist before id vote for obama
4013114 if they had campaigned here it probably would have come out differently
4013115 there are more voters in florida alone than there are in nevada and south carolina combined
4013116 we believe iowa new hampshire nevada and south carolina play a unique and special role in the nominating process and we believe the dncs rules and its calendar provide the necessary structure to respect and honor that role
4013117 it is not a legitimate race it should not become a spin race it should not become a fabricated race
4013118 theres a question in the community thats unfortunately been stimulated and stirred about and played with in e mails and innuendos and newspaper articles
4013119 that suggests that theres something wrong with senator obamas views about jews about israel
4013120 there are nagging doubts there are e mails there are innuendos these are the kinds of things which we as a community have suffered over the years at the hands of anti semites
4013121 but the american people dont quit and they deserve a president who doesnt quit either
4013122 her campaign will have new momentum and she will soldier on
4013123 needs to win by a margin of 10 percent or more
4013124 some say anything over five points would be a respectable victory
4013125 she beat john kerry and ted kennedy in their back yard
4013126 tonight we are hearing the voices of people across america
4013127 who do you want ive got governor spitzer ive got rob reiner
4013128 shes going to be demonstrating a national base thats very hard to overcome
4013129 strongest showing among female voters of any contest so far
4013130 my mama always taught me to play by the rules
4013131 ive got to say he certainly keeps things interesting maybe a little too interesting at times tonight i must confess
4013132 i will make my case to every american who will listen
4013133 i will not confine myself to the comfort of speaking only to those who agree with me
4013134 mike huckabee showing surprising strength john mccain will eke out this win
4013135 the most important thing is that the pepfar renewal sends the signal that the american people are going to stay in this for the long term
4013136 in the past few days we have learned many many things
4013137 is not in the best interest of unionbancals minority stockholders
4013138 the city is taking a huge step forward in figuring out how to address the housing crisis
4013139 create another nail in the coffin of the housing market at the worst possible time
4013140 dear drs please forgive me for this horrible transgression i have no where else to turn so i ask you to mercifully gently and lovingly please help him sleep his name is kaiser and hes 16 and a half years old hes been my friend my teacher my pupil my lifelong loving and loyal companion
4013141 be good to him as you would your own child for hes been mine for a loving lifetime
4013142 weve been together 24 7 365 days a year since he was 8 months old hes gentle smart and ill miss him more than i could admit saturday evening without warning or any outside influence he began rolling on his back on the floor all four legs extended rigid and thrusting wildly in all directions i saw fear and panic in his otherwise unrecognizable eyes his head was pulled down to his right and he seemed unable to do otherwise if i had to render a guess i would say it appeared as though he had a stroke he can stand but 85 percent unsteady hes fearfully reacting to attempts to get him to drink water he refuses food as though hes totally lost knowledge of what to do with food
4013143 im a homeless disabled vet and i know when its time to say goodbye to a friend and its time now hes such a part of my being ill once again be alone in my life i love you kaiser thank you for caring sincerely kaisers soul mate
4013144 after youre in this business for so long you learn to look the other way because we have to euthanize animals this one i couldnt euthanize
4013145 when you leave your house in the morning and go to work and you dont see them until you come back well thats one lifestyle
4013146 during the evening when the noise was going on he came out and confronted the victim and they had a scuffle
4013147 it ended up with the suspect shooting the victim and causing his demise
4013148 people are roaming around and enjoying themselves until this year
4013149 is consistent with the fact that gas prices were going up so quickly and to such a high level
4013150 i used to drive to vegas once a month twice a month but not anymore
4013151 i saw where oil prices were up 3 today so i figured id better fill my car up before the price went back up
4013152 he did not stop his murderous acts voluntarily but because of the heroic acts of the neighbor
4013153 i had a bad feeling at first i wasnt sure if the neighbors were kidding around i thought maybe the kids who live east of me had gotten hurt
4013154 even the police said nothing like this ever happens here
4013155 he ran over there and said drop the knife right now and the attacker did
4013156 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
4013157 apple wants to really move this product and really create volume for the iphone
4013158 i dont think supply is going to be an issue unless demand is off the charts
4013159 weve talked to apple weve been told we will have product on our shelves on sept 7 well do the best we can do
4013160 today its scott mcclellans what happened inside the bush white house and washingtons culture of deception
4013161 it is about restoring civility and bipartisanship and candor to our national political discourse it is about putting our nations interest above partisan goals
4013162 could you not have taken some of this to the grave with you and done this country a favor
4013163 your book quite frankly is a political book launched in the most political time
4013164 selling out the president and his friends for a few pieces of silver
4013165 acted in a way that violates my obligation to my family
4013166 dedicate some time to regain the trust of my family
4013167 very pretty brunette 5 feet 5 inches and 105 pounds
4013168 im here for a purpose i know what my purpose is
4013169 i am not a moron you know what i mean so maybe thats why girls maybe think theyre difficult
4013170 part of the exercise that ive been going through over the last 15 months
4013171 we spend quite a bit of time with you on the back of the straight talk express asking you questions and what weve decided to do today was invite everyone else along on the ride
4013172 this is who i am if you dont like it go away
4013173 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4013174 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4013175 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4013176 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4013177 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4013178 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4013179 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4013180 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4013181 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4013182 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4013183 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4013184 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4013185 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4013186 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4013187 es dif cil jugar cuando en el equipo hay una mala relaci n con personas que nos est n dirigiendo si el conductor de un veh culo est despistado ser dif cil que pueda llegar a su destino sin ning n percance

4013189 hay desconfianza hacia gente que nos est dirigiendo y as es imposible centrarse y hacer nada
4013190 en cuanto acaben los juegos me voy a mi casa la relaci n con los jugadores y con los dirigentes es muy dif cil y faltan muchos medios para poder hacer un trabajo en condiciones a unos juegos ol mpicos no se puede venir con estos problemas
4013191 son gente dif cil no se puede vivir all en venezuela hay demasiados problemas de todo tipo deportivos y no deportivos
4013192 i dont care how much talent a team has if the boys dont think tough practice tough and live tough how can they play tough on saturday

4013197 a man who has never gone to school may steal from freight car but if he has a university education he may steel the whole railroad
4013198 mr schmieder attended ohio state university and ohio university taking courses in mechanical engineering and business management
4013199 one of the most reliable sources of scathing rebuttal to the left wing media has become known for its humorous but biting style his regular verbal assault on labour ministers has quite a reputation
4013200 we like mr eugenides we highly recommend adding him to your blogroll go and read it is absolutely the most glorious stuff
4013201 oh boy i think reading you and devils kitchen is going to damage my psyche what a joy
4013202 the most amusing non stop critique of the labour government available
4013203 my favorite anglo rage boy the best apoplectic brit blogger
4013204 a widely acknowledged political genius of the first order still he finds time to visit greece sink a pint or two and take on the idiots who purport to govern our fair land
4013205 there really is no purpose to be served by following humbly in the wake of the genius of mr eugenides why seek to improve on perfection when one knows in advance that one will fail
4013206 i am impressed with the dexterity of mr e linguistic and otherwise
4013207 i rather enjoyed the retort of the blogger known as mr eugenides
4013208 we have a good draw and i think a good chance to go through but we must approach it professionally
4013209 you can lose to anybody they are professionals as well and will want to win the first leg at least
4013210 on a bad day if we are not concentrating then we can lose this kind of game so we must be careful and take it seriously we took odense seriously in the intertoto cup and that is how we should always be
4013211 i dont really like to talk about attitude because we are all professionals and get a lot of money to play football so we should go into each game with the right attitude there is no excuse for not having it
4013212 and if we can progress as far as possible in europe this season that will help the development of the team and the individual players
4013213 if he gets on the bus he has every chance of being picked
4013214 children who do poorly at school are more likely to have been affected by the food they ate many years earlier rather than the chicken nuggets they had at lunchtime
4013215 i do believe fema should be a knight in shining armor
4013216 theyve forgotten their core mission and in the middle of disaster they dont need to get caught up in administrative code
4013217 i think weve all learned a lot by this event and if another disaster hits we will all know better what to do
4013218 despite all these frustrations a lot of amazing things happened
4013219 this bridge was designed and built in just over eight months
4013220 i dont think thats ever happened before in thurston county
4013221 in the past they always put in culverts but those always got washed out this is permanent
4013222 contribute an additional 1 million to fund a regional climate change study
4013223 who on earth would put lsu in there as an opener we played lsu in 1983 a 40 14 husky loss but it wasnt like they had just won the national championship
4013224 they seem like maybe they have better athletes as far as the overall squad
4013225 i think the one area that really shows up is in the secondary it was so young last year they only had a half dozen scholarship players or so and when opponents spread you all over the field they can take advantage of guys in a hurry
4013226 i thought he threw pretty well and it looked like he had a lot of confidence and poise
4013227 you just set yourself back another three or four years its amazing how well weve done in recruiting with all the negative publicity and we cant just blame you guys the media its the nature of the beast these days
4013228 i think hes got guys who can coach and i think tyrone can coach
4013229 hes the president of our organization the american football coaches association and hes in it for all the right reasons i just look at last year and with that schedule if they had just played pass defense on the last drive of three games they win three more games i would look at that and i wouldnt blame anybody but obviously they didnt have any depth back there they just had a lot of youth with a guy like ed donatell and a little better talent back there they can do a lot better
4013230 hes an impressive guy and he has had great experience since the time he left here really working with some good coaches pete carroll and some of those nfl guys
4013231 they devote hour after hour after hour to football and you really learn a lot
4013232 i just look at the program is it making progress they played some really good teams last year really well for a half i think obviously the talent is going to catch up sometime

4013234 during the first event i did perform very bad and it was a big pity
4013235 i let many people down i thought about giving up but during the past days fans give me a lot of support and my spirit resumed
4013236 i made the same mistake that i made at the 10 meter air rifle but i knew i couldnt repeat the same mistake for the remaining shots
4013237 what was most difficult was not the last four years but the last four days which felt longer than four years
4013238 it was so hard since i lost my first but i held on
4013239 we were anticipating a slowdown and had started planning for it more than 18 months ago

4013244 these decreases were primarily due to a decline in home values and the shift in the composition of new mortgage loans to include more conforming loans and fewer jumbo loans also contributing to the decreases in the average revenues per order closed was the increased mix of lower premium refinance transactions and a decrease in higher premium resale activity

4013287 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
4013288 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
4013289 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
4013290 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
4013291 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
4013292 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes

4013314 each year as many as 50 infants are placed on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation but die while waiting owing to the lack of a suitable donor heart
4013315 adding an additional two three or five minutes or even 75 seconds does add some additional injury it could be 10 percent
4013316 the 6 month survival rate was 100 percent for the 3 transplant recipients and 84 percent for 17 control infants who received transplants procured through standard organ donation
4013317 as a result of their investigational protocol three babies are now alive had the procedures not been performed it is virtually certain that all six babies would be dead

4013351 i think were definitely on the right track as a team
4013352 of course ken lucas played a big part in that
4013353 guys are still working and still battling and i think that is a great sign
4013354 like always there are always tougher times than others but i think we worked through everything pretty well i like this group so far
4013355 we were anticipating a slowdown and had started planning for it more than 18 months ago
4013356 this means we are well placed to deliver our gross profit margins within our target range of 39 5 40 0 per cent throughout fiscal 2009 fiscal 2012

4013383 i would have liked to have had the opportunity to put my case because there are few players who can do what dominic does on a cricket field
4013384 i dont know how these decisions are made but ive got to walk out with these players and if theyre not in the best frame of mind ive got to deal with it
4013385 people sitting up there drinking their gin and tonic dont have to deal with it
4013386 with the longer term development of the playing staff in mind and to allow the side to evolve
4013387 in sri lanka last year there were bombs going off while we were there
4013388 but you did not feel threatened by it because you have got the security detail and the army give you escorts
4013389 id certainly trust what icc security expert reg dickason says after spending some time with him so ill have to wait and see what he says
4013390 it is obviously tricky because if you are in a position like me having only played a dozen or so internationals you certainly worry about giving your place up and not winning it back
4013391 inside me i think i would not have a problem id trust in them but then your family is saying you must be crackers and your girlfriend is saying i dont want you to go
4013392 it would be completely different if it was on moral grounds
4013393 the zimbabwe trip would be a complete no brainer you just wouldnt go there if you can sleep at night
4013394 id be happy to go to pakistan thats for sure
4013395 when the decision is made to go i am sure security will not come into play because at that point they should already know that it is safe to go
4013396 its all been a bit too quick for me the last two weeks really
4013397 my mind has been going at a 100mph and ive been overwhelmed that ive been picked so i have just got to keep doing what i have been doing for notts and hopefully it will all work for me
4013398 i cannot stress enough how much i want to get out there and play for england since i got the call i have been thinking about how i would bowl at particular south african batsmen
4013399 ive been visualising their shots and the way they play visualising what they will do in a certain situation of an over maybe off the first ball and last ball of an over i visualise what they would try to do to me if i was bowling when i was batting
4013400 its something new to me ive never been here before so to make an impression is one thing but you can get caught up in personal pressures and distractions
4013401 what you really must do it just go out there and perform and do whatever youve been doing for your county that got you there

4013411 i gave it all i had and just wasnt good enough all credit to alain he swam a great race and swam me out of it
4013412 that relay loss was very hard for me i really took it to heart at no point in todays race did i think i was going to lose
4013413 i tried to stay master of the race and master of myself

4013415 we believe that a pay offer of 4 95 is very competitive especially when compared with the uk average rise of 3 7 we are disappointed the rmt is taking this stance and passengers have every right to feel angry over the proposed action
4013416 the rmts vote against the offer and the length of their proposed action defy reason and perhaps suggests there is an ulterior motive behind the rejection they have made no secret of their desire for tube maintenance to return to public ownership
4013417 tube lines has made enormous profits on the backs of our members hard work yet they seem to expect that they will accept an inferior deal on pay pensions and conditions
4013418 despite rmt claims that the deal is not equal to that set at metronet tube lines believes its pay and conditions are very competitive and amongst the best in the rail industry

4013423 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias budget and immediate cash needs
4013424 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4013425 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4013426 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4013427 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4013428 oh help yourself one more time wont make any difference
4013429 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4013430 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4013431 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4013432 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4013433 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4013434 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4013435 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4013436 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4013437 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4013438 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4013439 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4013440 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4013441 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4013442 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4013443 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4013444 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4013445 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4013446 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4013447 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4013448 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4013449 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4013450 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4013451 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4013452 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4013453 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4013454 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4013455 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4013456 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4013457 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4013458 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4013459 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4013460 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4013461 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4013462 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4013463 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4013464 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4013465 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4013466 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4013467 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4013468 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4013469 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4013470 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4013471 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4013472 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4013473 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4013474 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4013475 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4013476 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4013477 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4013478 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4013479 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4013480 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4013481 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4013482 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4013483 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4013484 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4013485 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4013486 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4013487 n o tiramos nenhuma piada mas a constru o do roteiro foi um processo delicado tivemos rabes americanos e judeus americanos como consultores eles at sugeriam algumas piadas mas confesso que alguns rabes e israelenses se recusaram a ler o roteiro pois n o se sentiram confort veis com esse tipo de humor
4013488 mas que fique bem claro que eu n o quis representar todos os israelenses como se achassem que james bond representa todos os brit nicos
4013489 fiquei surpreso que o adam tenha topado fazer tantas cenas constrangedoras no in cio ele nada como um golfinho depois aparece depilado e em nova york as velhinhas adoram lamber seus mamilos

4013493 eu s quis fazer rir corta o meu cora o s de pensar em ter magoado algu m espero que isso n o aconte a
4013494 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4013495 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4013496 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4013497 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4013498 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4013499 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4013500 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4013501 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4013502 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4013503 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4013504 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4013505 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4013506 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4013507 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4013508 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4013509 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4013510 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4013511 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4013512 who are open to doing something on the production side
4013513 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4013514 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4013515 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4013516 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

4013543 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
4013544 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
4013545 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
4013546 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
4013547 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
4013548 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
4013549 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
4013550 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
4013551 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
4013552 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
4013553 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
4013554 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
4013555 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
4013556 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
4013557 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
4013558 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
4013559 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
4013560 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
4013561 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
4013562 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
4013563 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
4013564 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
4013565 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
4013566 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
4013567 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
4013568 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
4013569 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
4013570 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
4013571 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
4013572 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
4013573 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
4013574 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
4013575 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make

4013613 the united states and the world expect russia to honor that commitment
4013614 i specially checked it with the general staff of the russian armed forces there are no russian servicemen supporting the peacekeeping operation in georgia in poti
4013615 we are not making any secret of that they are staying there to neutralize the large arsenal of weapons and other military hardware in the areas of gori and senaki these arsenals remain unguarded apparently those who guarded them fled
4013616 aimed at ensuring the peace enforcement operation in respect to the georgian side which violates all of its obligations
4013617 with the purpose of demilitarizing the zone adjacent to the conflict area and also guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population russian peacekeepers are evacuating this hardware vehicles and ammunition
4013618 we believe the russians are consolidating their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia and will not significantly expand their ground presence in georgia
4013619 we believe the russians will fall back to their pre crisis boundaries we do expect russia to retain a military presence in both enclaves for the long term
4013620 we do see a halt to offensive military operations if there is a formal cease fire we believe the russians will adhere to it while reserving the right to use military force to respond to threats against their troops
4013621 russian tanks continue to ravage georgia town and villages killing people destroying buildings looting theyve been doing worst things to what ive heard in the past and i could never imagine happening in my country

4013628 matt mason has become an integral part of our squad since arriving in 2002
4013629 on the field he has had a tough 18 months but is now playing regularly with the first xi he has certainly earned himself a new playing contract for 2009 but we want to look ahead so he will take on a dual role from october as a bowling coach
4013630 this appointment gives matt some certainty for the future whilst he can concentrate on extending his playing career i am delighted he has accepted the appointment
4013631 only 3 months ago i was wondering if i would ever play again so to be offered this combined role is more than i could ever have hoped for
4013632 as a player i believe i still have a lot to offer and since returning to the first team i feel i proved that
4013633 coaching is something i am very passionate about and at worcester i believe we have one of the strongest and most talented squads of fast bowlers in the country
4013634 to resolve the government appeal the supreme court instructed both parties to take steps for the speedy hearing of the writs under trial in the high court once we get the copy of the appellate division order we will take initiative for hearing of the writs
4013635 for any cases filed by anticorruption commission it is mandatory to take approval in three phases this approval should be taken while filing the case during charge framing and when the trail court takes the case into cognizance but in these two cases the relevant clause of the law had not been followed
4013636 the anticorruption commission approved the cases before filing the case and also while framing charges no law has been violated in this respect

4013651 it was after 9 p m and they were singing away but i didnt know if it was new or if i just hadnt listened before
4013652 theres not enough information to know why birds sing when they do how noise affects bird song thats why were doing the study
4013653 i heard them but this summer was my first time recording so i didnt know if the birds had just started singing at night or if i was just so tuned into bird song that i was hearing it for the first time
4013654 id be very interested to talk to people whove heard birds singing at night
4013655 i was really surprised because usually birds go to sleep at night
4013656 oh wait maybe they do i take my hearing aid out at night but if they do sing at night i would like that i like birds singing anytime
4013657 if the birds are singing in your neighborhood at night and they werent singing last summer its probably because a tom cat thats a really good birder moved into the neighborhood

4013668 hmm hasnt wordpress already had many of these features for awhile now
4013669 it is out of the question to talk of recession
4013670 there is a degree of volatility in germanys figures and it is possible that output could rise again next quarter but the french figures are a real shock and heighten the risk of a technical recession across the eurozone
4013671 it will be a close run thing whether we see a technical recession with two straight quarters of contraction if we define recession as a significant decline in economic activity then we will avoid one
4013672 if this really happens in the real world women on the pill would end up choosing a more genetically similar mate than she would otherwise choose and the implications go on from there

4013675 a womans response to a mans natural body odor will be colored by her feelings for him
4013676 so if you fell in love with a man online it would be hard to be repelled by his smell

4013706 we are unapologetic about our role in the amarnath agitation it is the response of the masses due to the accumulation of their grievances if parties supporting the upa can plead for organisations like simi why cant we stand with the masses
4013707 it shows utter callousness to even talk about delimitation in respect of j amp k when it is so tense and volatile
4013708 its just tragic thats all i can say about it
4013709 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this

4013719 naturally colin is relieved and it will go some way to compensating him for the vilification that he has received at the hands of the public and media for the least 16 years
4013720 not merely an excess of zeal but a blatant attempt to incriminate a suspect by positive and deceptive conduct of the grossest kind
4013721 i became a national hate figure i had to endure every form of vilification i was insulted attacked spat upon my home was attacked and so was i my name alone was enough to stop me getting work
4013722 this is an offer that has been made and that offer has been accepted
4013723 but of course what he really wanted was an apology from the metropolitan police and i think he has accepted that is something he will never get
4013724 he is not angry he is hurt and disappointed he is gradually getting his life back on track and this will act as a catalyst
4013725 colin is realistic enough to realise and accept that his name no matter what happens will always be synonymous with the tragic events of rachel nickells death
4013726 i like to help people but im here to follow my dreams

4013846 i definitely have always responded to people who live what they believed and peter bergson was a guy who did he was a shining example of what one man can do how one individual can change history
4013847 as a consistent defender of absolute individual rights this was of course an absurd grotesque accusation especially as his whole life was dedicated to fighting for life liberty and freedom in the culture of the time however anyone who was not a socialist or outright communist was often tagged with that epithet
4013848 he didnt fall into any left right alternative he was or became essentially a radical for individualism in same way ayn rand or jabotinsky was
4013849 instead of wasting their time fighting bergson jewish leaders could have mobilized to create a tidal wave of pressure the non jews were often more than glad to jump on board

4013859 it is very unfortunate that this happened but i seriously question whether jose or his teammates realized at the time what harm might come of the organizers suggestion
4013860 jose calderon is far too classy to intentionally insult anyone there is no doubt however that better judgment could have been used by everyone
4013861 one of our sponsors asked us to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing so we made an oriental expression with our eyes
4013862 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as somewhat loving
4013863 from here i would like to declare that we have huge respect for the east and their people some of my best friends in toronto are from china anyone who would like to interpret this differently is absolutely confused
4013864 they were trying to be funny it didnt necessarily come across as such and i think they made the appropriate gestures to apologize and as long as they learn from it we can all move forward

4014046 in beating new zealand in dunedin we saw the strength once again of percy at full back
4014047 i think it was percys style of play that helped us win the last time we played against the all blacks and i think we should use the same strengths again for this game
4014048 its not that conrad doesnt have his own special attributes but the ones that percy does have is the ones we want to use at newlands
4014049 there were a few reasons why i chose fourie over ricky and if i divulge in most of them i might as well just go join the all blacks training and let them know
4014050 so in a nutshell i just think its the right thing to do for this game
4014051 most people live in the past and struggle to make that step up to what the future expects you to do
4014052 i cant do that in rugby i promised the players i would be honest with them
4014053 if we look as how well ricky performed in the super 14 as well as in the tests this year hes in the form of his career
4014054 but his legs must be getting heavier and very tired
4014055 we just feel the time is now to make the necessary changes
4014056 ricky wasnt bad at kicking time nor was conrad but we do have an option with du preez at the base of the scrum as well as percy and his left boot
4014057 its great as a coach to be able to tell a player sorry man you are not starting this weekend and he didnt do anything wrong
4014058 so as much as its a blessing as a coach to pick form players over in form players lets hope the blessings continue to rain on the team this weekend
4014059 butch did really well against argentina and percy is one of the worlds leading goal kickers

4014092 they do their own singing and their own dancing in the film
4014093 you get the opportunity to see both of these guys go for it in a real way thats fun and energetic mac definitely can carry a tune he does a great falsetto in the movie and a baritone and alto as well he has a range he plays a range of emotions in the film as well as octaves
4014094 when i came on they asked do you want him in the movie and i was like of course not to include him in the movie would have been sacrilege i had to have isaac in the film
4014095 when i went to shake his hand and tell him how much i loved him and what a great job he did he hugged me back and looked me in the eye and said make a great film man
4014096 im pretty sure riddler gets his shot ed nigma gets his moment
4014097 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
4014098 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
4014099 what we wanted to do and i think well continue to do as the studio continues to push the movie forward is to be able to put queen in the center of a much bigger universe
4014100 in the same way that marvel is starting to do when youre in the filmed dc universe where this world and this world and this world they all exist in an interrelated web its the kind of thing that i think absolutely is about spelling out a couple different roads for a couple different characters
4014101 by the time a movie like this comes out we will all understand origin stories and mainstream audiences now are willing to suspend their disbelief to the point that we can believe that a world exists where superpowers exist and people dress up in costumes so now what now what do we do and i call this superhero 2 0
4014102 we do deal with his origin hes got a very interesting origin with a desert island and everything else but we get to the core of green arrow not by showing where he starts but by pushing him into a key moment in his life where everything he has is lost and hes got to earn it all back i think for audiences its going to be a great way to get to know a new character
4014103 i started remembering my dad did this movie called putney swope i was in new york at that time and the character was supposed to be a vietnam soldier so i was remembering some of the folks who were hanging out in the west village back then
4014104 without it being too specific i just started this gravelly cool very world weary voice and i said oh my god im going to have a ball with this
4014105 i laid the voice on stiller and he laughed and i thought you know hes just laughing to make me feel ok and then hes going to change it all when we get there
4014106 he was really improvising a lot of the time and there was a little bit of a question like is that intelligible
4014107 we did some looping too but it really was who the character was and what he was playing the idea of this australian guy playing this black guy and his interpretation of that that was always what we were satirizing the idea of to try to be taken seriously
4014108 i think this is going to be a big coming out party for him as a comedian
4014109 you knew he was a great actor with chaplin but all of the films hes made were great dramatic films this is the first one where its been full blown comedy and his skills are sharp
4014110 life is too goddamn serious things are scary i got to laugh my ass off in this movie ill take that over rocket science any day and ill certainly take that over self important dramatist
4014111 its actually been really fun weve been listening to our ipods and i slept for a lot of the time weve been just keeping each other busy
4014112 it seems like time goes by so slow because im so excited
4014113 i really like spending time with my kids theyre really good girls and the jonas brothers are just awesome theyre darlings
4014114 its kind of cool to be a part of it its good to see people so excited about a band
4014115 i want you to sing this with me as loud as you can
4014116 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4014117 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4014118 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4014119 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4014120 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4014121 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4014122 i guess its going to be me and ryan in the middle tomorrow
4014123 its fine its all i wanted to do tomorrow is going to be the real battle
4014124 i think over the next few days the biggest thing is going to be trying to get as much rest as i can if i can do that ill be fine
4014125 thats what im going to be focusing on over the next three days
4014126 please place your hand under my thigh 3 and i will make you swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of earth that you shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the canaanites among whom i live 4 but you will go to my country and to my relatives and take a wife for my son isaac
4014127 suppose the woman is not willing to follow me to this land should i take your son back to the land from where you came
4014128 beware that you do not take my son back there
4014129 the lord the god of heaven who took me from my fathers house and from the land of my birth and who spoke to me and who swore to me saying to your descendants i will give this land he will send his angel before you and you will take a wife for my son from there
4014130 but if the woman is not willing to follow you then you will be free from this my oath only do not take my son back there
4014131 o lord the god of my master abraham please grant me success today and show lovingkindness to my master abraham
4014132 behold i am standing by the spring and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water 14 now may it be that the girl to whom i say please let down your jar so that i may drink and who answers drink and i will water your camels also may she be the one whom you have appointed for your servant isaac and by this i will know that you have shown lovingkindness to my master
4014133 please let me drink a little water from your jar
4014134 i will draw also for your camels until they have finished drinking
4014135 whose daughter are you please tell me is there room for us to lodge in your fathers house
4014136 i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah whom she bore to nahor
4014137 we have plenty of both straw and feed and room to lodge in
4014138 blessed be the lord the god of my master abraham who has not forsaken his lovingkindness and his truth toward my master as for me the lord has guided me in the way to the house of my masters brothers
4014139 come in blessed of the lord why do you stand outside since i have prepared the house and a place for the camels
4014140 i will not eat until i have told my business
4014141 the lord has greatly blessed my master so that he has become rich and he has given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and servants and maids and camels and donkeys
4014142 now sarah my masters wife bore a son to my master in her old age and he has given him all that he has
4014143 my master made me swear saying you shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i live
4014144 i said to my master suppose the woman does not follow me
4014145 he said to me the lord before whom i have walked will send his angel with you to make your journey successful and you will take a wife for my son from my relatives and from my fathers house
4014146 so i came today to the spring and said o lord the god of my master abraham if now you will make my journey on which i go successful
4014147 please let me drink a little water from your jar
4014148 you drink and i will draw for your camels also
4014149 before i had finished speaking in my heart behold rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder and went down to the spring and drew and i said to her please let me drink
4014150 then i asked her and said whose daughter are you and she said the daughter of bethuel nahors son whom milcah bore to him and i put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists
4014151 and i bowed low and worshiped the lord and blessed the lord the god of my master abraham who had guided me in the right way to take the daughter of my masters kinsman for his son
4014152 so now if you are going to deal kindly and truly with my master tell me and if not let me know that i may turn to the right hand or the left
4014153 let the girl stay with us a few days say ten afterward she may go
4014154 do not delay me since the lord has prospered my way send me away that i may go to my master
4014155 may you our sister become thousands of ten thousands and may your descendants possess the gate of those who hate them
4014156 who is that man walking in the field to meet us
4014157 he was at the draft with us the first couple of years alex was with the 49ers anywhere alex would go david would go with him the super bowl everything
4014158 i asked him if he wanted to come up for saturdays game he was going to come up
4014159 im going to apply a little pressure to the practice how well we practice will determine whether we practice in the afternoon
4014160 heej vinnie wat ben je aan het doen ik zit in alkmaar nu en ga zo de trein naar amsterdam pakken kan ik even bij jou langs komen misschien kunnen we even een broodje gaan eten ofzo

4014164 we are all committed to keeping the children as close together as possible and to minimise disruption for everyone at the school
4014165 we will be writing to parents staff and young people to update them on how plans are developing we have been inundated with messages and offers of support from schools and companies both locally and from further afield we are now working through these kind offers to make sure that their generosity is not wasted
4014166 its good to know people are thinking about the school
4014167 with a greater number of people attending the premises there is a significant likelihood of crime and antisocial behaviour increasing in the locality
4014168 in the opinion of the community safety group set to look at crime and anti social behaviour in st ives the town is unable to cope with an increase in the night time economy at the present time
4014169 weve been very interested in it and finding out how ready colleges are for these students
4014170 more and more of these people who were identified in the 1990s could be headed to college
4014171 the parents are saying wow my student has the grades and theres a place that will provide the appropriate support for him or her
4014172 most classes are 50 minutes long two to three times a day
4014173 the rest of the time youre navigating the college community my advice to students is to realize the least amount of time you spend in college is in the classroom
4014174 he thinks he could do it without going to the center but he really does need them
4014175 they have all been very helpful and supportive of me i tried a semester without going to the center and ended up with very low grades because of late assignments or no assignments turned in
4014176 it does not matter how slow you move so long as you do not stop
4014177 all the six who died and the two who became invalid had no family history of heart attacks or any pre history of heart ailments or paralysis handled challenging projects at work in their respective companies they worked long and continuous hours the end struck them very suddenly and it looked as if their hearts refused to take any more stress
4014178 our study confirmed that the number of suicides divorces heart ailments bp and diabetes patients and mental depression are the highest in the banking industry the fancy salaries of professionals are no longer something to rejoice about
4014179 we found that the banking industry has simply deadlines hang before them and every day they chase new problems during weekends more than 60 per cent of the vehicles are found parked in the office complexes there is no physical exercise and new food habits favoured by pizza culture fuel the problem cervical spondilitis and wrist problems due to uncomfortable handling of the computer mouse eye problems and discomfort in bowel movements are common the stress for couples where both are employed in the it industry is the worst the simple step of taking time off from work for three months allowed a banking couple wanting a child for years to conceive one
4014180 even if the company sponsors a movie or self care lecture not many attend them
4014181 la divulgazione dei nostri sport dama e scacchi uno degli aspetti di cui ogni damista scacchista dovrebbe farsene carico e secondo me un grande pregio che distingue il vero appassionato dal semplice spingitore di pezzi qualunque categoria di gioco esso sia
4014182 haitian fight song potrebbe anche intitolarsi afro american fight song lassolo che io prendo in questo pezzo pieno di concentrazione non posso suonarlo nel modo giusto se non penso al pregiudizio allodio alla persecuzione e a quanto tutto ci sia iniquo in esso c della tristezza e ci sono delle grida ma c anche della determinazione quando finisco di suonare di solito penso io glielo ho detto spero che mi abbiano ascoltato
4014183 la parte reazionaria del discorso del comico lo sfott c una grande differenza fra il teatro sfott e il teatro di satira il teatro di satira sempre morale basti pensare al timore al panico che hanno avuto sempre i potenti davanti ai problemi della satira perch la satira in molti casi ha determinato la presa di coscienza della gente soprattutto delle classi inferiori ha fatto capire di avere il potere di ribaltare le situazioni di avere il coraggio quindi temuta qual la differenza che esiste fra fare satira e fare sfott allora posso dire a un giovane attento che giocare esclusivamente sulla pura caricatura legata a un personaggio anche a un uomo politico che grasso piccolo magro magari ha la gobba magari si intartaglia non realizza niente questo fa fare soltanto una risata fine a se stessa ma se non c la dimensione morale se tu attraverso la satira non riesci a far capire il significato opposto delle banalit dellovvio dellipocrisia soprattutto e della violenza che ogni potere esprime e porta addosso ai minori ebbene il tuo ridere vuoto proprio lo sghignazzo ventrale e non quello dello stomaco e dei polmoni
4014184 he is a dreamboat if i were that age and single id be in so much trouble
4014185 i said youd be exactly my type he liked it he was like that would be great i was of course teasing but of course not teasing
4014186 hes so nice and grounded and sweet as can be hes the real deal hes a teen idol
4014187 she was great shes a very normal 15 year old girl and i guess that makes her extraordinary considering the circumstances
4014188 she works hard and shes got a good attitude i think with the right direction and the right choices she can do some great things
4014189 hes a very nice guy and we had a real good time together
4014190 shes such a different character than jan shes earthy with no ulterior motives
4014191 you know shell either be a great mother or be the greatest example of what not to be as a mother
4014192 itll be interesting to see michael and jan now they always have a power struggle he had it all last season and now shes got it back again and it keeps them an interesting couple
4014193 when i was growing up i had a pretty difficult time
4014194 i just found when i was introducing myself to people it was a little awkward
4014195 you get all those wee wee jokes and that sort of thing
4014196 he e mailed me right away and said holy sh the nintendo is named after you
4014197 the reason my parents chose that is because they didnt really have a name picked out when my mom was pregnant
4014198 i thought it was weird nintendo would go with that
4014199 now when i meet people i say my name is wii
4014200 oh wii are you going to go home to play with yourself
4014201 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
4014202 we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from isaacs dear friends colleagues and fans from every corner of the world and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayers
4014203 we provided intake documentation and the judge said it was insufficient
4014204 the judge said he should have informed the court sooner and because it was the second time hed missed court in this case she issued the warrant
4014205 working towards getting him some help and we hope that will be taken seriously by all parties in this case
4014206 he qualified for us and he feels comfortable with me
4014207 we have to work out an arrangement that will work with the courts
4014208 we are in court again next week on other matters and my hope is we can get the warrant resolved by then and get back on track we have some things in the works to get the warrant taken care of my hope is that we can resolve it without an arrest but hes been arrested at the airport before so they obviously have an eye out for him so im not sure
4014209 ik ben van ver gekomen en ik ging voor mijn derde goud op rij dat is niet gelukt en daar baal ik van
4014210 het was een goede race ik was opnieuw sneller dan mijn wereldrecord van acht jaar geleden maar nu baal ik ik zou ook een waardeloze sportman zijn als ik hier met een glimlach op mijn gezicht rond zou lopen
4014211 ik heb alles uit mijn mogelijkheden gehaald ik heb een versleten onderrug en heb daardoor een beperking bij het trainen van mijn benen en bij het starten en keren die explosiviteit mis ik maar heel hard zwemmen dat kan ik nog steeds
4014212 but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from 2006s the black parade
4014213 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
4014214 its weird sometimes you give interviews and they catch you in a weird mood on the road and youre like nah i didnt say it was going to be a more punk rock record i just thought it would be more stripped of the bells and whistles
4014215 the little rock police said however at an afternoon news conference that the shooter whom they did not identify was not a gwatney employee and so far as they knew never had been contrary to some early reports mentioned here
4014216 en las ltimas d cadas se ha vuelto el consentido en los c rculos de competencia por su tama o porte y apariencia
4014217 tomorrow the new record releases its just a really amazing time in our lives
4014218 were so excited were going to go to virgin megastore across the street and wait in line a little bit longer
4014219 we do anything for our fans and we owe everything we have to them
4014220 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
4014221 i think it is more urban im working with producers who are just amazing
4014222 id rather not but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to
4014223 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
4014224 id love to if i can find the right movie
4014225 were just trying to work it out with my schedule with the children
4014226 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
4014227 it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy
4014228 britney and kevin wanted to settle but there were issues of how much time we wanted and there was an upcoming court hearing scheduled
4014229 recounts the life of aisha a girl who was married off at the age of six to a 50 year old man called mohamed ibn abdallah on her wedding day aisha was playing on a see saw outside her home inside she was being betrothed the first she knew of it was when she was banned from playing out in the street with the other children when she was nine she was taken to live with her husband now 53 he had sex with her when she was 14 she was accused of adultery with a man closer to her own age not long after mohamed decreed that his wives must cover their faces and bodies even though no other women in arabia did
4014230 the only thing i can equate it to is falling in love
4014231 it doesnt matter what aspect of life youre working on you always have to learn how to recreate something
4014232 you always have to learn how to grow and change and from a musical aspect thats definitely what weve done with this album there was a lot of growth i think but not too far away from worship because thats who we are
4014233 we met last sunday and evaluated the progress met again today and evaluated the progress we felt it was up to snuff very impressed hes down a significant amount of weight and hes ready to go by no means is it a finished product youll see hell continue to get extra work after practice as we continue to push to where we want to be the only emphasis is to make sure hes the most dominant nose tackle in football i like where we are were on the planet and moving in that direction
4014234 i thought that the finish to that game was a great experience for some young men to be in somewhat of a pressure situation and have to deliver to have to communicate and know the whole offense and make some plays i thought some guys did that but overall in review of the game i thought that we got some things accomplished that we wanted to accomplish i thought that our first offense was sharp coming out of the gate that was important to us it was important that we got willie parker going and got him some looks we were able to do that we wanted to give rashard mendenhall a few totes and see what he was capable of and i thought that we did that to a degree i thought that dennis dixon came in and did some nice things special teams were solid which of course was important to us jeff reed banged a kick home that he didnt bang home at practice up at latrobe the other day that was by design to put him in that situation and jeff delivered defensively i thought that we ran to the ball although we were sloppy tackling at times which is kind of indicative of the first preseason game there is a silver lining in those situations because you get put on the short field and you have to stand up in the red zone we made them kick a few field goals i thought that was good all in all it was a productive outing the first time out and we are glad to get a win
4014235 who are you how many hit records do you have
4014236 back in college when me and my roommates would get hammered and rap along to victory id yell to no one in particular that this was one of the 10 greatest hip hop songs of all time while clutching a quart of mickeys ice in one hand and a half eaten totinos party pizza in the other well just so you know heres a partial list of other things i thought were pretty great back then drunk driving self immolation ramen noodles the wwf phishs billy breathes and the career prospects of florida gators qb jesse palmer a k a the guy who ended up on the bachelor

4014239 how many lives were lost during your tragic vote or die campaign in 2004 when will your savage thirst for blood be slaked
4014240 what have i ever done what have you ever done aside from you know launching a multimillion dollar media empire lording over a hugely successful clothing line shaping the career of perhaps the greatest mc of all time scoring a series of hits as both a producer and a solo artist and running in the new york city marathon on a whim actually wait never mind
4014241 your skin is way smoother than i wouldve imagined given the amount of times i have seen your proactiv commercial
4014242 in tons how many magick talismans ancient tomes aleister crowley artifacts did it take to convince jimmy page to appear in the video for that god awful song you did on the godzilla soundtrack
4014243 did you know that the average american is blessed with a blissfully short memory and yet a seemingly endless appetite for nostalgia so much so that he or she is willing to forgive most transgressions and forego all pretenses of taste in exchange for a song that will sound excellent in very large speakers or at the beach are you aware that most of us are doddering sods brainless infants who prefer things big and loud and shiny and equate aesthetic excess with true happiness do you realize theres a sucker born every minute did i just let the cat out of the bag

4014287 the image prototypes physically implement a reflectance field and generate different light fields depending on the incident illumination for example light falling through a window
4014288 we discretize the incident light field using an optical system and modulate it with a 2 d pattern creating a flat display it is free from electronic components
4014289 it limits the speed of the whole process to the speed of your electronics
4014290 the light and the fibres can quite cheerfully sustain a couple of terahertz but your electronics cant do more than a few gigahertz
4014291 the ability to slow the light could be a tremendous force for telecoms that is sure to enhance speed and efficiency
4014292 with these materials you could imagine something more like a single chip with the metamaterial handling the routing all the capability of one of these big filtering systems but the size of your fingernail
4014293 were living with what was put into the system before the telecoms bubble burst in 2000
4014294 there needs to be more clever ideas so that the existing infrastructure can be used in a different way
4014295 i think the kids take it for granted that they can flush
4014296 and they dont have to think about where it goes
4014297 after some members of the organization complained about the video which was supposed to be humorous the organization took it off their website
4014298 would it be wrong to ask people pray for rain
4014299 what disappoints me the most is that i had tickets in my shopping cart 9x and never got them due to poor website performance
4014300 they need to be publicly shamed theyre a great gaming company but really bad at e commerce apparently
4014301 its kind of a no win situation for blizzard the con is so popular
4014302 its a shame because its a customer service problem for them its really disappointing to really want a ticket and not be able to get through on the web site
4014303 the main complaint people had was it wasnt handled very well eleven million people playing the game and only 12 000 tickets apparently blizzard didnt notice that
4014304 it seemed to us that they didnt even run a sale through to make sure it worked
4014305 the people who were trying to buy tickets in the first place are blizzards biggest fans theyre the ones who will spend the money and drive across the country and it was such a nightmare i think it will tarnish blizzards reputation
4014306 i think a lot of people understand that blizzard is a company that makes video games and not a company who sells tickets
4014307 it just pretty much boils down to lack of preparation on the site
4014308 as for customer experience theyll forgive a slow site but a down site really affects your brand and user confidence
4014309 it doesnt matter how many tickets you have to sell but how many people want those tickets if you only have 12 000 tickets and you have a half million people wanting one you have to be prepared for this
4014310 while the site has slowed down at times it still works
4014311 blizzard always holds things close to the vest games are in development for a long time before they are shown to the public at blizzcon they get to look behind the curtain
4014312 there is somewhere around 10 or 11 million users at wow eleven million people wanting to do anything at the same time would destroy any network anywhere
4014313 most companies have a gap in their infrastructure theyll spend a ton of money making sure the game is up and running anything that generates money is valuable
4014314 our biased opinion is that game developers are still very good at developing content
4014315 two hours were spent in the queue two hours in the game two hours in the queue half the time i was waiting to play the game i was paying 15 to play
4014316 consumers are more demanding now theyre not going to pay 15 a month just to play like this especially in a tighter economy
4014317 its the internet people make a big deal about something and then forget about it i dont think its going to dampen the excitement at blizzcon this year
4014318 what the district really needs is someone to bring people together on a lot of big and small issues
4014319 it was the only large urban district to do both of those things
4014320 id like to repeat the positives of what i learned in san diego here in temple city
4014321 the morale in the district has been low for some time
4014322 positive relationships within the district and strengthen communication trust and respect at all levels
4014323 because im new to the district and we have three board members who are in their very first year were in a learning mode
4014324 but one thing i do know right off the bat about temple city unified is that people care about our district and about each other
4014325 the budget cuts and declining enrollment it goes hand in hand
4014326 what i definitely would like to do is work with our principals on all levels and the community on reversing that
4014327 with that comes the wonderful pr that we can capitalize on
4014328 we didnt have the community and employee support that we needed last time so that will be a big focus
4014329 we cant have our students be excellent in podcasting and all these technical things if the circuits are getting ready to blow
4014330 when things need replacing and fixing the way to do that in a school setting is through a bond
4014331 we have to address that because its getting at the learning environment of our students
4014332 royston hoggarth will lead our uk business comprising the current global services uk and uk corporates teams roystons combination of expertise enthusiasm and entrepreneurial spirit will prove a great asset as we continue to drive our performance in the uk market
4014333 sony ericsson wanted to make sure our first hsdpa handset was the perfect combination of style and function as all know hsdpa is a big leap forward in the speed of mobile functionality but as always sony ericsson does not deliver technology for its own sake
4014334 we believe the z750 is such a compelling offer because not only will it be one of the best looking clamshells on the market but it also provides the tools or applications which really let you get the most from these broadband speeds
4014335 sony ericsson is continuing to deliver on the promise of the marriage of sony and ericsson with iconic products such as the z750 says najmi jarwala president sony ericsson mobile communications usa inc there is no question that hsdpa is critical for north american gsm operators and we believe products like the z750 will entice the mass market to tap into everything these faster networks enable consumers to do while on the move
4014336 it was a really vicious violent assault that obviously involved a huge amount of rage
4014337 we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4014338 in the days ahead we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4014339 i just want to concentrate on one thing and do it 100 i want gold
4014340 several russian sites specialise in selling software that would be cyber criminals can download
4014341 where extortion or fraud is involved you can follow the money trail
4014342 websites run by chechen militants are hosted in western european countries with relatively large secure networks capable of handling larger volumes and less easily taken off air
4014343 the very notion of crime only exists in places where you have the law and the law is applied
4014344 she was under significant financial pressure and that is reflected in the fact that these charges relate to buying groceries for the family from tesco and asda
4014345 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4014346 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4014347 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4014348 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4014349 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4014350 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4014351 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4014352 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4014353 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4014354 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4014355 second chances they dont ever matter people never change once a whore youre nothing more
4014356 but god does it feel so good cause i got him where i want him now and if you could then you know you would
4014357 she looks like shes about to bark and chase cars
4014358 eigentlich hat die kunst sich immer sehr bem ht sich der mode zu verweigern aber heute ist sie mit ihr eine symbiose eingegangen inzwischen ist mode auch so eine art inszenierung die weit ber das dekorative hinausgeht
4014359 ja doch sie kann einen mit dem ansinnen des bleibenwollens auch bedrohen nicht wahr ich meine alles ist verg nglich au erdem ist es ja auch nicht so dass man nach einer saison alles wegwirft ich entdecke oft kleider die drei vier jahre alt sind und denke ach so etwas sch nes f llt dir heute nicht mehr ein ich geh re ja noch zu den dinosauriern der mode die alles selbst machen
4014360 ja und irritation ich finde kleider die aussehen als br uchte man anziehhilfen unerotisch designer wie alexander mcqueen foltern frauen mit korsetts und st tzstangen meine kleider sollen so aussehen als ob jemand wie brigitte bardot direkt aus dem meer kommt wie damals in cannes ich sah das als junge die brauchte nur ein schlampiges t shirt dagegen wirkten alle anderen hollywood stars auf einmal wie alte gebrauchte cadillacs
4014361 guter stil ist es souver n mit seinen fehlern umgehen zu k nnen das haben frauen wie jennifer lopez vorgemacht mit ihrem viel zu dicken arsch ich finde das nat rliche unzul ngliche viel aufreizender als das glatte
4014362 ich versuche den zeitgeist nicht zu treffen denn der geht vor ber und dann stehst du dumm da allein auf der party heute werden die sachen durch die medien so bekannt gemacht wenn ich dann eine 60 j hrige mit der must have bag sehe sieht die frau doppelt so alt aus wie ihre tasche man kann sich auch ins abseits shoppen
4014363 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4014364 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4014365 wir freuen uns ber unser umsatz rekordergebnis und den erfolgreichen abschluss unserer akquisitionen
4014366 these kids they make messes faster than we can clean em

4014368 i have a new respect for tip and what hes going thru i know its got to be hard he is a good dude
4014369 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4014370 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4014371 perhaps fewer people read now than before but i for one still do
4014372 it doesnt matter how good or bad the product is the fact is that people dont read anymore the whole conception is flawed at the top because people dont read anymore
4014373 you have spare to learn chinese yet seven years left
4014374 if i need to know the number of workers compensation fraud cases in western massachusetts i should be able to pull up my own reports
4014375 it met our needs better than any other solution we can map it to our workflow and with the whole system online managers can check case progress at the main office and satellite offices at any time plus customer expressions was flexible and amenable to provide any customization we might need
4014376 the fact that i sight is already in use at a very similar organization in another state gave us the confidence that it will work for us
4014377 it will ensure that investigators spend their time on cases rather than filling out reports we expect to process more cases with the same staff and streamline administration of the whole process

4014379 were supposed to paint motivational posters what is this a pyramid im not painting a fucking pyramid
4014380 we need to take a step back when we look at the down low phenomenon
4014381 we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens with the highest rates of new cases african american men and women
4014382 they are living with them have children with them but have no idea
4014383 what i see in my practice is that it is largely associated with individuals who have substance problems
4014384 i see a great number of patients who are into crack cocaine it is a way of life
4014385 especially in this community where were far away from san francisco and oakland theres a feeling of not having a lot of support
4014386 its hard to get people to come because theyre afraid theyre going to be seen by someone
4014387 to our dismay what we came upon was church after church after church in the black community turned its back on the african community and said its something we dont want to deal with
4014388 the church had been told that its a sin and anybody who had aids god was punishing them
4014389 i think that there have always been men who were having relationships with men and women and are clandestine about it the down low isnt new hiv is new
4014390 theres the assumption that these men are somehow the bridge between the gay community and the heterosexual community
4014391 the research just doesnt support that theyve always been there if these men were the bridge then why didnt this happen in the 80s
4014392 theres really a dearth of research around black people and hiv
4014393 one of the reasons is that the researchers dont look like us
4014394 has sparked a new dialog among black women and among the black community in general
4014395 were still trying to figure out how to do that
4014396 help support them in a way where they do feel comfortable talking to their women partners

4014399 theres no question that for her broadcasting career that this is a good opportunity for her
4014400 but we also have a good opportunity here for our team it was her choice
4014401 for me i could be doing my rehab and training in new york and having this unbelievable opportunity or i could be rehabbing and sitting on the sideline in seattle
4014402 it wasnt like i just up and left the team
4014403 id call it a control issue like he agler needs to have everybody around
4014404 and if youre going to go so far as not starting her now youre hurting your team and your franchise were dealing with pros here and some good positive press for the seattle team and youre not dealing with someone who has any history of not doing the work
4014405 the fine isnt a surprise we knew that might happen what is a surprise is that coach agler would view it appropriate to air that in the press
4014406 i prayed on it and it was pretty easy because its gone the way ive always handled stuff with class there are people that get bitter and angry but i talked with teresa about the whole process and she said she was really surprised by how i was handling things i told her my focus was to get myself back in contention for the team in 2012 and i wasnt going to let this derail my aspirations of winning a second gold medal
4014407 she looks like broadcasting is what she should be doing were happy for her
4014408 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbours occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4014409 the west has spent a lot of time energy and money to teach georgia the tricks of the trade to make the country look like a democracy
4014410 we and many other nations see through this deceit we understand that the seditious tactics of the so called colour revolutions are a real threat to international law and the source of global legal nihilism
4014411 it would backfire and play into the hands of hardliners who argue that the west is always conspiring against russia
4014412 enough from you dont say another word to me about this matter
4014413 here is moses kind of whining and pleading with the lord and it reminded me of a child whining to his her parent
4014414 the mining stocks rallied though after stronger base metals prices overnight ms simpson said
4014415 weve already spent some 50 million buying back some 35 gigalitres from the system
4014416 we have today agreed that we will initiate 80 million of water buyback earmarked for south australia
4014417 we will also now conduct a queensland water tender from those who hold water entitlements in queensland
4014418 extending the existing commitment of 34 million to 40 million
4014419 that is 400 million allocated now for the purchase back of water entitlements in the northern basin from queensland and nsw down to the menindee lakes
4014420 theres been some challenge to the accuracy of the murray darling commission numbers
4014421 we will commission one of the independent accounting houses of the world to separately and independently audit the accuracy of the murray darling basin commissions numbers
4014422 we were anticipating a slowdown and had started planning for it more than 18 months ago
4014423 this means we are well placed to deliver our gross profit margins within our target range of 39 5 40 0 per cent throughout fiscal 2009 fiscal 2012
4014424 and one on ones werent going that great for us today but the last three days we were dominant in those
4014425 were doing this well enough in the practice environment that were exposing the things that need to be addressed
4014426 the appellants as indonesian citizens have constitutional rights which are not to be tortured

4014428 currently the average base pay for waiting and bar staff is around 3 50 3 75 an hour plus tips in fact base pay can be as little as 2 an hour however by the time this change is introduced the minimum wage will be set at 5 73 an hour with tips on top

4014432 this study should be enlightening and practice changing for doctors and patients alike
4014433 its a tricky business and it requires a lot of close followup
4014434 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
4014435 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
4014436 it is a much more common scenario today that it would have been even five years ago
4014437 in my opinion its an open and shut case they dont have irreversibility and they dont have death
4014438 as difficult as that was to hear this opportunity provided us with a ray of hope
4014439 at that point zachary was so sick we did have him at home but we knew it wasnt much longer
4014440 hes just a crazy little kid who loves to play and swim and throw rocks
4014441 addison did only live three days in this world but because of this she lives on
4014442 michael marien summaries the current crop of future oriented books and articles because he seems to read and see everything published in the realm of the next no matter how obscure or academic his comparative evaluations of books are astoundingly useful each issue i usually discover one or two great works of forecasting i had not known about but more importantly future survey extracts the key ideas from piles of mediocre books books i no longer have to bother with marien synthesizes these reviews into emerging notions which then become indispensable for tracking mega trends not mere fashions and fads marien has been doing this for 20 years and his database of 5 000 reviews available online is as good a history of the future as we have for his almost single handed crusade to tame the uncertainty of what is coming marien should get a medal

4014455 podr a cambiar la tendencia de los subsidios de manera importante
4014456 la pol tica de precios que se ha venido siguiendo es la que se aplicar en los pr ximos meses
4014457 con lo que no descart que para este a o la cifra pudiera ser de tres d gitos
4014458 en el pa s lo que deber amos estar haciendo es estar produciendo los petrol feros y petroqu micos que requerimos para nuestro consumo
4014459 y esa es la labor que realizan nuestros legisladores en el congreso de la uni n se hace un an lisis profundo de la problem tica de pemex y estoy convencida que a partir de ese an lisis nuestros legisladores nos dar n las mejores soluciones
4014460 es muy pronto para hablar de ello lo que sabemos es que ser mayor a lo que ten a estimado el congreso por el incremento en los precios internacionales
4014461 aunque ste ser muy grande mucho mayor a los 200 o 250 mil millones de pesos y depender en mucho de la capacidad que tenga el estado mexicano para poder afrontar estos subsidios en combustibles
4014462 la impunidad en m xico nos est destrozando en nuestro pa s ha habido muchos fernandos y ha habido muchas reacciones pero tambi n se han olvidado hay que frenar la impunidad que nuestra autoridad tenga un alto ndice de aprehensi n y de juzgamiento y sentencia eso es lo que debemos hacer
4014463 tengo confianza en que la parte buena de la polic a la procuraci n de justicia los descubra y los castigue tengo la completa seguridad
4014464 en este pa s estamos viviendo en medio de una gran confusi n tenemos polic a pero a veces no creemos en ella los secuestradores se disfrazan de polic as entonces nos confunden en mi caso concreto levant a mi hijo gente disfrazada de afi eso me oblig a no acudir a la polic a pero s puedo decir con orgullo y una fe renovada en nuestras instituciones que cuando acud a la polic a nos trataron de tal forma que me arrepent no haber acudido a ellos desde el principio

4014474 respect for themselves and other people and let their imagination explore
4014475 we were very lucky to have got away with a draw very lucky not to have conceded goals it was a very disappointing performance but the team know they have to improve and i did not have to say much to them in the dressing room sometimes you do not need many words
4014476 it will be different at anfield there we are expected to win and we will have our own fans behind us liege had their very noisy fans for the first leg
4014477 we were not surprised by the fine performance of the liege side we had seen enough of them to know they were a good aggressive side
4014478 the real surprise for me was the way liverpool played the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
4014479 production grades of ore from the mine have been much higher than expected entailing faster build up of concentrate and expanded trucking schedules
4014480 results slightly exceeded expectations but the market is waiting for august 19 when the group will revise its budget
4014481 it seems we will not have a downward revision in forecasts but one should also not expect a considerable change upwards the market reaction should be slightly positive
4014482 the group should deliver significantly improved earnings in the second half of 2008 mainly due to the favourable coal and iron ore market conditions
4014483 priced more attractively than they have been in a very long time
4014484 our mines are operating as planned our expansion projects are progressing well and we continue to realize excellent silver prices there is no question that of late silver prices have been extremely volatile however the fundamentals remain positive and i am optimistic that silver will trend higher over the balance of the year leading to continuing strong financial results for pan american
4014485 at the same time our bottom line has been affected by industry wide cost pressures including higher prices of energy and other consumables currency exchange impacts and higher taxes and royalties
4014486 we were a very young team and we did not lose our nerve did not panic
4014487 in the end maybe our technical superiority allowed us to score two goals that is a massive advantage for the second leg but we will be on our toes
4014488 they imposed a very physical game on us with man marking all over the pitch they did that with a lot of belief and spirit
4014489 you saw a performance of great spirit and arsenal were rattled they know they have been in a game
4014490 the points didnt go for me in the last round i knew i wouldnt get the decision unless i knocked him out the scoring here is so bad for an olympic games its unbelievable
4014491 i felt my performance was exceptional but ive had better days i felt i should have had six or seven points for my body shots but theyre not scoring body shots you might as well do fencing not boxing if theyre going to do that
4014492 i didnt really think about what time i needed but to go quicker than yesterday is good and its only a fraction off my best time
4014493 i have a whole day to rest now i didnt get that much sleep last night i keep thinking about random things i had a dream last night i was getting done for murder hopefully it wont come true
4014494 ok all of me then all of me for all of eternity
4014495 i dont see why a suburban homeowner would like it around their house
4014496 and the brown hills my tawny lions as i call them
4014497 use of rocks pebbles redwood chips and stones in lieu of live plant material
4014498 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4014499 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws

4014502 a fruitless person is not a failed christian but a false one
4014503 it ignores our biggest energy problem transport fuels and the rising cost of oil and relies on drill and hope no one with any common sense would invest in more subsidies to fossil fuels when new zealand is so well endowed with renewable energy
4014504 removing the energy efficiency standards that have saved consumers 148 million on their power bills so far in favour of encouragement will take us backwards
4014505 their announcement as new policy a 1000 grant for solar water heating is something the greens have already secured with government and is already operating
4014506 the policy has no security of supply where fossil fuels are concerned
4014507 back in the mid 1980s we had a similar scenario where fuel was about 30 percent of costs but we didnt have any quota so you could fish your way out of it
4014508 in the mid 90s successful operators had six to seven percent of earnings going back to fuel
4014509 it was assumed that petrol prices would impact on the tourism industry but nobody expected the traditional australian family holiday to have changed so much
4014510 tassie at the moment has no indigenous gas so wed be the first producer of gas in tasmania
4014511 typically foam is usually soft and mushy but this one snaps and rebounds back
4014512 we were able to lock down the foot in the shoe but still give the athlete flexibility
4014513 when i first saw them i didnt believe they were tennis shoes because they are so beautiful and light however after two days i fell in love with them and i made a call to nike to say these were the shoes i wanted
4014514 these shoes allow me to feel light on my feet when going for the shot and are more comfortable than the previous tennis shoes i wore the ventilation is also excellent before when i finished practice my socks were usually quite wet but with these shoes the situation improved significantly my feet now feel dry and comfortable after practice
4014515 i think its a little more natural position for him
4014516 and it allows him to rush the passer every single snap which maybe sometimes when hes playing outside linebacker he had more coverage responsibility where now hes able to use more of his skills as a pass rusher
4014517 mid to late september i think hes more determined to make that sooner but weve just got to make sure physically that he can go the rest of the season
4014518 m scuza i c v deranjez cu aceste informa ii
4014519 the uppers fit the foot perfectly and are incredibly light and comfortable
4014520 until i hear anything else thats the way im looking at it right now
4014521 im focusing on football until i hear anything else ill assume its over
4014522 mo wouldve run until he hit his head on the goal post on that play
4014523 i guess ive had a lot of jobs but im 60 years old too if you look at most 60 year old guys theyve been a few places
4014524 its a little bit different circumstances being your last year you might feel a little bit more comfortable with someone whos coached receivers in the league
4014525 as a coordinator you kind of coach the quarterbacks but not really
4014526 ive always wanted to do that trapped inside this body is a hell of a quarterback
4014527 this is an old established time tested proven offense some of the great players who have ever played the game played in it some of the great coaches who have ever coached the game coached in it there are a lot of nuances to it and it takes a while to learn
4014528 i have no complaints the business has been good to me
4014529 i remember walking off qwest field after we won the nfc and i said to myself man ive been here for probably the two top football moments in the citys history winning a national championship at washington and now i get to coach for a team thats going to the super bowl
4014530 we got a phone call before we even walked in the door
4014531 she was happy i get to do what ive always trained for but sad in the sense wed planned for this for a while
4014532 and its nice to come back to a group of guys i already know
4014533 hes punting better right now than he did last year
4014534 the third year is usually a lot of times the year that punters start to kind of get it all together
4014535 people dont understand how important a snapper is to a punter
4014536 its really even more important than a kicker because you get the ball back to the holder and you put it down in the same spot every time and theres some variance on the timing but with the punter if the snaps not right on him he has to move his feet to catch it once he moves his feet he has to reset
4014537 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
4014538 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
4014539 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
4014540 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
4014541 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
4014542 way too fast its a new generation and its now time to step aside
4014543 they did a great job im from the previous generation with alex popov
4014544 ive raced many times against alain but i didnt know he was in my league we met before the races and hes a great guy and we have a good relationship im very happy with an ambassador like alain hes a great sportsman
4014545 its been a very long time my fourth olympics my fourth final in the 100 freestyle
4014546 the olympics is very special to me when i was 10 years old watching seoul watching matt biondi i got really inspired
4014547 i thought maybe it was possible to make history and win three times in a row but in 2005 i got really set back and started from zero
4014548 after eight long years and swimming three times in a row 47 seconds this is under my best i did in sydney its a big achievement for me personally im realizing it now because a few minutes ago i was very very disappointed because i was close to the bronze its weird but i was only thinking about ways to win the race and that was impossible with guys like eamon and bernard
4014549 im going to take my rest now i deserve my rest
4014550 one of the things that alldata made clear is that we were in competition within the region but also outside the region we were challenged to do what we could to assist
4014551 but i look at it like sometime someone built the very best wagon wheel ever but there came a time when we didnt need any more wagon wheels
4014552 the auto industry is in a state of transition nationwide which has had an impact on florin road and consequently has a negative impact to tax revenue for the city
4014553 it really begs for a mixed use high density development were working with the city council and others it could evolve into a very spectacular mixed use community
4014554 the closed dealerships have generated a great deal for the city so of course were sad but were going to make lemonade out of these lemons
4014555 gas prices have created a permanent shift in the minds of american consumers and more importantly car shoppers
4014556 our data shows that the law should require both the safer sequential firing system and training
4014557 if youre not getting the training you should have the safer trigger
4014558 if were able to accomplish what we think were able to accomplish we think the future will have one mls
4014559 at this point were waiting to see what the final structure is
4014560 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
4014561 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4014562 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4014563 eu tinha sonhado esta noite que chegaria em terceiro mas a acordei e pensei puxa estou na raia oito
4014564 se fosse perfeita eu teria conseguido bater o recorde mundial

4014569 there is no more fire season as we know it the fire season is now all year round
4014570 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4014571 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4014572 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
4014573 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
4014574 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
4014575 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
4014576 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
4014577 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
4014578 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
4014579 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
4014580 were already experiencing that in traffic congestion in schools and in our crowded coastal areas
4014581 money is just an excuse to avoid thinking very much about the life you are living
4014582 its what you learn after you know it all that counts
4014583 that the party has told them all to decline all invitations and that he declines to appear
4014584 it sets a terrible terrible precedent for all future committees if people can thumb their noses at this committee and ignore a summons
4014585 i dont know the reasons what if somebodys on vacation what if somebody had a heart attack what if somebody needs a kidney replacement or dialysis
4014586 se ha gastado demasiado dinero en cuestiones que poco tienen que ver con las necesidades b sicas de los ciudadanos
4014587 un hecho sin precedentes en la historia demogr fica de espa a
4014588 los precios de las viviendas en estados unidos posiblemente comiencen a estabilizarse o tocar n fondo en el primer semestre del 2009
4014589 los precios podr an continuar movi ndose a la deriva hacia la baja durante 2009 y m s all
4014590 como una persona que gana millones de d lares en los ngeles en un pa s y una ciudad con fuerte influencia asi tica americana l gasol debe actuar mejor
4014591 gasol necesita disculparse y punto por unirse a sus compa eros ol mpicos espa oles al usar sus dedos para rasgarse los ojos en una fotograf a de promoci n de los juegos de pek n
4014592 c mo pueden creer los espa oles que mofarse de los rasgos f sicos de la gente puede ser un gesto de solidaridad y respeto
4014593 las perspectivas apuntan a una continuaci n de este proceso dependiendo del alcance del ajuste del empleo
4014594 es m s incierto que el de los ltimos trimestres
4014595 i have two kids im worried about so i have other priorities
4014596 but i dont want to say that theres some magic solution here
4014597 its very difficult in the space of six months or so to fix a decades worth of neglect
4014598 las perspectivas apuntan a una continuaci n de este proceso dependiendo del alcance del ajuste del empleo
4014599 es m s incierto que el de los ltimos trimestres
4014600 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4014601 no mandatory rules exist explicitly for arctic or antarctic navigation
4014602 i need mandatory codes i need certain rules that ships need to apply to operate in arctic or antarctic waters
4014603 i fear it is only a question of time before we have an accident on our hands
4014604 the danger of any kind of ship accident in the arctic is we wont be able to clean up the mess
4014605 our ability to clean oil spills is limited by the amount of ice in the water its extremely important that ships are well equipped for arctic conditions
4014606 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
4014607 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
4014608 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars
4014609 it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
4014610 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins
4014611 i bought four or five rolls of coins each month
4014612 i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now and then
4014613 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
4014614 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
4014615 i jumped out of my car and saw bodies in the streets
4014616 wherever i saw a body moving i helped carry them to a car to drive them to the hospital
4014617 there is no religion in the world that accepts such acts
4014618 against the hands that try to disrupt its security and stability
4014619 lebanon and the lebanese will not kneel or submit to the criminals and the terrorists
4014620 he came up and started stabbing her immediately without any words or argument
4014621 he did not stop his murderous acts voluntarily but because of the heroic acts of the neighbor
4014622 my problem with it is not so much the status of pluto
4014623 its not useful to do the kinds of science we do in solar system exploration it has no usefulness for people interested in understanding where geology occurs
4014624 when you have a decision based on a vote it is politics it is not science
4014625 pluto haters worked the political system to have a vote on a definition that would exclude pluto
4014626 the iau definition serves a very narrow segment of the astronomical community its not very useful for the rest of us
4014627 pluto was not big enough at its distance from the sun to have cleared its orbit so it was excluded
4014628 if you swapped jupiter and the earth the earth is no longer a planet
4014629 its like saying a fruit becomes a vegetable if you move it to the other side of the table what sense does that make why would the earths planethood depend on where it is located
4014630 people can see why this perspective is useful why that perspective is useful and which is more useful in something like teaching kids
4014631 the georgia crisis serves as a warning to countries such as ukraine and moldova that they should desist from petitioning for nato entry
4014632 otherwise moscow may intervene to protect the allegedly threatened interests of the russian population
4014633 russia now flush with cash wants to rebuild its 19th century imperial sphere of influence in the former soviet union
4014634 it also wants to make an example out of georgia to other nato aspirants what the chinese call kill the chicken to take care of the monkey so the ukrainians will think russia would use force to prevent them from joining nato
4014635 i would like to get to know someone that is approximately my height it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
4014636 aquele dia da derrota foi triste por sair da olimp ada

4014638 em competi es como olimp ada sele es v o se eliminando e chega um momento em que o brasil vai bater com africanos independentemente de ser camar es
4014639 um jogo importante pelo que aconteceu na austr lia em 2000

4014660 senior people in john holland were on site today to assure them that they remain part of the process
4014661 one of them yelled what are you doing on this land god gave us this land and no arab dog will set foot on it
4014662 when the argument began to heat up one of the settlers pulled out a gun and the other beat me up i was able to fight back a little but then the other settler began to beat me up as well
4014663 je serais tr s heureuse de rencontrer le prix nobel de la paix
4014664 je voudrais le rencontrer les contacts sont en cours avec mon cabinet et le bureau du repr sentant du dala lama pour trouver le meilleur moment
4014665 il a un programme charg du fait de cette visite pastorale il est l pour une dizaine de jours je ne doute pas quon arrivera trouver une date d s que possible
4014666 on va voir si cest possible que a se passe le plus vite possible
4014667 pendant des mois je nai cess de prendre position sur la question du tibet
4014668 je ne vois pas ce quil y a de choquant ce que la premi re dame de france rencontre le dala lama
4014669 at a start price of 99 cents and of course with no reserve
4014670 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for
4014671 we let her know about the policy and instead shes now selling a photograph of the offending knickers
4014672 ebay does connect colourful buyers with colourful sellers and i wouldnt be surprised if someone did buy these items though i couldnt speculate on who would buy them or why
4014673 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage
4014674 i felt unattractive short and self conscious about my body and i would purposely emphasize that by doing odd things
4014675 i wore glasses braces odd hairdos and dumpy clothes when i was a freshman i wore a christmas tree skirt as a cape i couldnt get any dates until senior year
4014676 it was surreal there were randomly placed jars of baby oil but no babies that i knew of it was great peacocks monkeys hot girls and old men in pajamas it was awesome
4014677 when you violate the condition the license disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer this is the theory of the gpl and all cc licenses put precisely whether or not they are also contracts they are copyright licenses which expire if you fail to abide by the terms of the license
4014678 important clarity and certainty by a critically important us court
4014679 the use of oak in wine plays a significant role in winemaking and can have a profound effect on the resulting wine impacting the color flavor tannin profile and texture of the wine
4014680 the commander explained to us that we will not receive building permits in this place he said we needed to find another place outside the fence with water and electricity and freer movement we told him we would not leave for any price we have documents proving this is our land everything is recorded in tabu the land registry
4014681 the supreme court approved moving the fence from the green line into the territories it did not decide to move people i believe israel is a country that follows the rule of law and also takes into account international law
4014682 however we have been here since the 1950s since the jordanians time and they came only in 1982 why are they taken into account but we arent why do i have to spend an hour in my car and be checked at two roadblocks in order to go shopping in qalqilyah which is a 10 minute walk from my house so it will be more comfortable for them you dont want us here so please move the fence to the green line and well go back to being a neighborhood of qalqilyah
4014683 the possibility exists of offering the bedouin residents in arab a ramadin and arab abu farda a living arrangement at a site beyond the fence route
4014684 even if you believe there is a big difference between forced transfer and voluntary transfer the difference is minimal when those designated for expulsion are dependent on civil administration permits and permission for every little thing
4014685 you know that there are hardly any areas where the village residents are not subject to the mercy of the army and the civil administration in all these areas you have limited our clients rights and occasionally even prevented them from being exercised at all
4014686 the administration wishes to find a permanent fitting and quality housing solution for the residents and is working to do so through dialogue and with their consent yet it is committed to enforcing the planning and construction laws in the region
4014687 the master plan submitted to the field unit several years ago was reviewed and turned down for various planning and security reasons and the residents representative was notified
4014688 reuters is deeply disturbed by a conclusion that would severely curtail the freedom of the media to cover the conflict by effectively giving soldiers a free hand to kill without being sure that they were not firing on journalists
4014689 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
4014690 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
4014691 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly
4014692 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
4014693 god has a plan its all part of the plan
4014694 we are very excited to bring full scale genomic analysis to the study of our closest extinct relative the mitochondrial result is only the tip of the iceberg as we push towards the completion of a whole neanderthal genome sequence
4014695 an internship is a nice opportunity for both an employer and an employee to size each other up to see if theyd be a good match and real world experience will always trump anything you read in a book
4014696 we have read your emails over the past few days and have been touched by t 15 4
4014697 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
4014698 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
4014699 those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
4014700 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
4014701 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene

4014708 when interaction gets more natural computers can be everywhere to listen to you
4014709 even in a field like astronomy its not just looking through an eyepiece but testing theories and software lets you do that
4014710 mobile phones are increasingly becoming software driven platforms although they were just for voice before
4014711 as we get screens that can roll or fold out to be bigger or mobile devices that have small screens but can project larger images on walls that line between whats a pc and a mobile will keep getting grayer
4014712 software innovation will be pervasive it will happen to other things in our lives like our cars and our tvs
4014713 a cantora mirim dublou voz de garota considerada menos graciosa
4014714 it isnt the crime but the cover up that gets you
4014715 how would you feel if your husband cheated on you
4014716 leaders at all ages have to be willing to hear the bad news over and over and still see a silver lining
4014717 do i detect any difference between now and when i was 70 a little but there is nothing significantly diminished
4014718 am i a better executive than i was at 47 in some ways absolutely i think less in terms of me and more for others i dont have the same level of enthusiasm but i can inspire others more easily
4014719 there is a prime age like wine aged or seasoned executives establish credibility
4014720 there will be someone a lot better than me long before that
4014721 its an all consuming role i dont know many ceos who are effective more than 15 or 20 years
4014722 some companies use a mandatory retirement age to avoid a potentially awkward conversion and to provide younger leaders with a visible path to higher office
4014723 if the company is objectively managed changes in leadership will happen when appropriate making arbitrary limits unnecessary
4014724 experience is not about having more answers its about asking the right questions
4014725 age does raise questions but i would not write someone off at 70 because of age itself
4014726 i dont think you get smarter but you get wisdom everything is not an existential crisis when you get older you separate out what is really a crisis from an average problem
4014727 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4014728 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying
4014729 she doesnt understand adoption she says its not natural for parents to raise other peoples kids sorry if she hurt your feelings pg 77
4014730 obviously it doesnt top the relay from the other night but its something that is really close to me
4014731 the momentum was great but physically it took its toll im lucky i survived that day im feeling a little tired right now
4014732 i did my best and ran out of room at the end
4014733 its tough but we got the american record by four seconds so we cant really complain
4014734 no matter what the outcome is you have to separate it and go on
4014735 theres a physical part too but ive trained for it im used to it
4014736 theyre going to show up and yall are going to be pleased by what you see im thinking its going to be real good
4014737 tomar las medidas necesarias para un inmediato establecimiento de los lazos diplom ticos
4014738 ambos presidentes han acordado establecer relaciones diplom ticas entre la rep blica rabe siria y la rep blica libanesa a nivel de embajadas de acuerdo con los pactos de la onu y la ley internacional
4014739 cabe esperar que la trayectoria de recuperaci n del ahorro de las familia contin e en lo que resta de a o

4014742 este acuerdo deber a basarse en los principios acordados firmados por osetia del sur y las partes de georgia adem s de rusia la uni n europea y la osce como garantes
4014743 la france sera en pr vision sur le trimestre 2 moins 0 3 donc un peu mieux que lallemagne et au m me niveau que litalie cest un ph nom ne qui est europ en et qui est mondial

4014806 when i listen to cornelius mds sample clips i thought he was barry white and i have heard a number of impersonators
4014807 cornelius md would do an awesome job and is the best man to carry on the barry white tradition

4014833 and he said you know im always careful thats just the way that he was charlie never had a bad day in his life
4014834 he loved helping others he died doing what he loved best
4014835 he would handcuff the back of my pants to the chair when i would stand up or he would hide my gear just before i needed it most
4014836 he also liked to walk up behind you and get in your personal space just to see your reaction
4014837 then you would turn around and see that smile on his face and you couldnt get mad you just had to bust out laughing
4014838 he had a more positive outlook on life and i just absorbed that because of him i was able and can still look at life on the brighter side
4014839 people are roaming around and enjoying themselves until this year
4014840 is consistent with the fact that gas prices were going up so quickly and to such a high level

4014846 since the beginning of the year we have launched dozens of programs and products that have the potential to make a meaningful impact on our future and we have made significant progress in aligning our expenses with the realities of an industry in recession
4014847 we believe there is growing pent up demand from those who have postponed buying during the past almost three years
4014848 an incentive to new customers to move off the fence and become first time buyers
4014849 the united states and the world expect russia to honor that commitment
4014850 i specially checked it with the general staff of the russian armed forces there are no russian servicemen supporting the peacekeeping operation in georgia in poti
4014851 we are not making any secret of that they are staying there to neutralize the large arsenal of weapons and other military hardware in the areas of gori and senaki these arsenals remain unguarded apparently those who guarded them fled
4014852 aimed at ensuring the peace enforcement operation in respect to the georgian side which violates all of its obligations
4014853 with the purpose of demilitarizing the zone adjacent to the conflict area and also guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population russian peacekeepers are evacuating this hardware vehicles and ammunition
4014854 we believe the russians are consolidating their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia and will not significantly expand their ground presence in georgia
4014855 we believe the russians will fall back to their pre crisis boundaries we do expect russia to retain a military presence in both enclaves for the long term
4014856 we do see a halt to offensive military operations if there is a formal cease fire we believe the russians will adhere to it while reserving the right to use military force to respond to threats against their troops
4014857 russian tanks continue to ravage georgia town and villages killing people destroying buildings looting theyve been doing worst things to what ive heard in the past and i could never imagine happening in my country
4014858 the civilian population should be protected against all encroachments on their lives and dignity
4014859 we are struggling with a supply issue right now if the investor money is not coming to us we cant invent new dollars to lend
4014860 industry people arent going to take applications for loans that arent going anywhere they are going to screen callers at the pre application
4014861 at this point theres nothing standing in our way of continuing to do what we said were going to do
4014862 today we face strong opposition and their weapon primarily is the press

4014867 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
4014868 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
4014869 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
4014870 im really not a chicken little player but i worry that no one seems to be focusing in on this

4014910 although im not a marketing major i have a bit of a trusted reputation after 18 years self promoting id like to inform you i had no say in this marketing campaign but if i did things would be different since it is obvious that this poster is boring odd and has zero to do with the movie i performed in
4014911 granted one poster stinking up the joint isnt the end of the world yet it sends the wrong message about our movie and i just wanted you to know that i feel the pain i really love the film and i know from past missteps marketing wise that the wrong poster sends the wrong audience into the theatre
4014912 im a huge terry francona fan about 10 years ago like to the same week he picked me up off waivers when i was with the braves and gave me a chance to start against randy johnson i ended up winning and i kind of got my start there so ive got a little fondness in my heart for terry cause he gave me my shot he runs a great clubhouse relaxed his one rule is just that you play as hard as you can and if you dont youll get yelled at and ive always loved that i learned a lot from him in philadelphia
4014913 i want to be counted on people have asked me are you excited about going to a team where theres a lot of pressure the alternative is taking the mound when games dont count and youre not in anything thats no fun at all so i love the pressure ive always responded to the pressure it doesnt mean ill do it here but it means that in the past i have a history of pitching in big games and doing well and so thats what i want to do
4014914 its getting late in my career ive never won a world series ive never pitched in a world series thats something ive wanted to do since i was a little boy and it feels like im in a place where that can happen
4014915 my first experience was a good one they didnt rough me up at all
4014916 theyll cut me a break and give me a pardon
4014917 in some ways we feel like its not really ours
4014918 can we turn this into something that can make money i dont know but that was never really the point
4014919 were locals and we just want to create something that the people of santa barbara will like
4014920 when you come down here and have a meal its going to be a special event
4014921 he was really pushing me to learn and i wanted to but my mom wasnt that happy about it
4014922 i played the rieding violin concerto which is not very advanced but i did get to perform it with a professional orchestra at the lobero
4014923 its very special because its almost like three generations of musicians from the same line
4014924 mr zeitlin heard something in harolds playing and was very encouraging to him i was delighted he invited him to come to the academy this summer as one of his students
4014925 its incredible for him to be one of the youngest students among all these very talented young professionals you can learn as much from the fellow students as you do with the teachers
4014926 ive never been around this caliber of musical talent and skill before its pretty inspiring when i see them working really hard to improve
4014927 i havent done a lot of chamber music before so i had to learn how to play with other people how to communicate with other musicians
4014928 i didnt expect at all that i would enjoy it as much as i have the other members of my group were very supportive even though i was lot younger
4014929 it was really great to get all these different ideas on the same piece
4014930 a lot of what they said would never have occurred to me it changed the way i think about music in general because of how they described the composers and what they were dealing with when they wrote the music that really opened my eyes
4014931 it does make me a little intimidated i know i need to push myself a lot harder to reach their level i realize i have a lot of work to do when i see them play but its very inspiring
4014932 i havent heard it before or played anything thats close to as complicated at that im sure that music is still way beyond me but its been fun to learn
4014933 i have great reluctance to support this amount of money
4014934 i want to see a list of whats not going to get the money we have lots of needs
4014935 this particular proposal brings a very positive approach to the issue
4014936 its obvious from all of that effort that we have a lot of community agencies that work with kids and do fine work
4014937 but we think for gang violence what our community needs most is people on the streets working on gang issues and we think we need to take the lead on that because were concerned about the safety of our kids
4014938 its something that could be done again with a lot of help
4014939 i truly truly think that this is a problem that can be handled i really believe that we can do this together this is not like a completely new phenomenon
4014940 having said that theres not a clear blueprint for this and theres no clear research that says just do this and youll take care of your gang problem
4014941 we frankly dont know where the money would come from
4014942 the big question is can we afford this and i believe as a community we cannot afford not to do it
4014943 its typical of what many residents here do with their properties who have those kinds of properties that are able to rent out and everybody seems to be conforming and complying
4014944 it was good of the obama camp to inquire about it because there are restrictions and regulations that govern this kind of thing here and for them to inquire and know about it was the right thing to do
4014945 basically the onus is on the property owner once you agree to rent it to someone you cannot rent it again for another thirty days

4014953 al melvin is not a common sense republican but an extreme ideological candidate
4014954 is allowing special interest extremists in maricopa county to dictate his positions
4014955 hes trying very hard to portray himself as more conservative in the primary in hopes that people will believe it
4014956 mr melvin is bad for our party bad for our state and bad for district 26
4014957 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4014958 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
4014959 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama
4014960 we need a statewide plan to create functional new transportation corridors that serve growing communities

4014978 its been a fairytale journey for me this medal represents the heart and soul of the team no one thought we could win a medal
4014979 but deep down we knew we could do and we never doubted ourself
4014980 avneet needs experience and think she was not prepared enough of course none expected her to win a medal but she was not in the best shape of her shooting career and it was a very okay sort of performance
4014981 i expected her to shoot 580 plus she was under pressure and this is surely disappointing when you see her score against her ability
4014982 for nearly two years we did not get any ammunition i told the secretary general of national rifle association of india baljit singh sethi that if we want to prepare well for the 2010 commonwealth games and the next olympics it has to start from september 1 we need three groups elite supporting and youngsters and there should be enough competition events in india
4014983 there is not enough competition in india and abhinav bindra was smart enough to stay out and compete in europe instead other teams practice 270 day a year and we come nowhere near that we got just two and a half years to prepare for beijing and that does not ensure medals
4014984 were really trying to come up with a clear system of accountability that parents can understand that students can click on and understand that teachers can understand

4015211 trouble with your ears offers practical help and advice to patients to ensure they get the best possible treatment for ear infections earwax or other ear problems that can cause pain and discomfort the leaflet includes top 10 tips for better ear health
4015212 there is evidence to suggest that ear problems are not always recognised by general practitioners and can be left untreated in these cases or where treatment is unsuitable such as the inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics a mild condition can become more serious
4015213 it is also common for elderly people attending hospital for a hearing aid to be found to have factors other than old age contributing to their hearing loss the fitting of a hearing aid can often be delayed while a patient is referred back to their gp for earwax removal
4015214 the more aware patients are of the treatments they should expect the better the prospects for their recovery
4015215 there is also plenty of self help information in trouble with your ears and tips to avoid ear problems in the first place
4015216 the department of health is committed to helping patients to help themselves yet few primary care trusts have yet adopted a self care strategy
4015217 through the trouble with your ears leaflet we aim to raise awareness of ear problems and give them more prominence on the public health agenda

4015253 like all businesses we occasionally run targeted marketing initiatives to promote small pockets of availability this is in no way a reflection of the current economic conditions
4015254 in fact as noted in our most recent results released in may 2008 we have not seen any evidence of deteriorating customer sentiment in booking patterns
4015255 while this is a genuine offer which some of our customers will benefit from it is a one off promotion to promote a few selected hotels and is in no way indicative of current trading for the group or overall market
4015256 these prices are very good for people willing to travel outside the peak holiday months

4015271 il existe des faits ahurissants qui exigent une enqu te dans des associations internationales de journalistes
4015272 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
4015273 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
4015274 there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
4015275 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
4015276 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp

4015282 weve learned that the nf1 gene affects stature through a different pathway than the one weve previously focused on to understand cancers in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1
4015283 we wanted to know if we could blame this on ras protein activity so we generated new mice with normal levels of neurofibromin expression but increased levels of ras activation in brain stem cells however those mice were normal
4015284 what weve learned also may help us gain insight into other disease processes there are a number of other rare genetic abnormalities that cause short stature and this same pathway may be involved

4015298 the groups outlook remains strong for the 2009 financial year sustained by a record level of work in hand
4015299 this workload should be maintained at similar levels given the opportunities that are likely to emerge in the groups core markets over the next year

4015411 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4015412 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4015413 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4015414 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4015415 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4015416 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4015417 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4015418 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4015419 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4015420 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4015421 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4015422 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4015423 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4015424 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4015425 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4015426 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4015427 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4015431 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4015432 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4015433 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4015434 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4015435 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4015436 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4015437 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4015438 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4015439 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4015440 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4015441 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4015442 you got to work hard to want to compete its like that and thats the way it is huh
4015443 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4015444 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4015445 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4015446 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4015447 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4015448 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4015449 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4015450 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4015451 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

4015453 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4015454 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4015455 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4015456 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4015457 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4015458 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

4015467 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4015468 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4015469 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4015470 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4015471 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4015472 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4015473 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4015474 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4015475 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4015476 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4015477 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4015478 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4015479 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4015480 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

4015486 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again because there is no effort without error or shortcoming but who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself for a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat

4015562 with the four copies given to each class every day we learn to discuss issues widen our general knowledge and develop our views
4015563 back at the beginning of the year i did a top ten predictions post where one of the predictions was the continued struggles of regional health information organizations rhios and the steady rise of health information exchanges hies since much of the ballyhooed national health information network nhin is built upon the premise of rhios and their success the nhin is basically dead in the water
4015564 any requirement on complaint will limit the appellants ability to regulate the engineering profession
4015565 our aim is to make the desaru pengerang international triathlon a truly world class event and if that means increasing the prize money then we have to do it
4015566 it also means that we have to find more sponsors and maybe we even have to pay appearance money for the top ranked triathletes in the world to come and compete here
4015567 this is the best league in the world and last year villa did very well
4015568 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
4015569 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
4015570 as captain and players we will have to make sure he doesnt get himself into trouble because referees will be after him id say
4015571 the door is shut now the players cant go full stop
4015572 he has to get the team to play successful good football as we are used to
4015573 the club have done everything to make his job comfortable
4015574 juergen has turned many things upside down now we need the results otherwise the changes and the investment are useless
4015575 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
4015576 while there is never a good time for an injury the timing of this injury was especially disappointing for me considering it forced me to miss the open championship british open and it comes in a ryder cup year
4015577 but taking proper care of it is my highest priority and im encouraged by dr weilands experience with this type of injury and his outlook towards my recovery and rehabilitation
4015578 the injury luke suffered is not all that uncommon for golfers and baseball players and im confident he will make a full recovery with the proper rehabilitation and training
4015579 hi there im patsy nice to meet you my dad and grandfather were criminals
4015580 those are not super bowl numbers but for august they are through the roof
4015581 in this fragmented universe for the summer olympics to get a 25 rating is unbelievable
4015582 now youre talking oscars and super bowl the few events left that can gather tens of millions of americans around a television set at the same time
4015583 we know the ratings for tv spike when michael appears
4015584 theres no question hes the dominant story hes a great driver of olympic interest but what were finding is that people might come to see michael phelps but they stay to see lots of other olympic content
4015585 tv is built on the star system and hes the star of these olympics if he had lost a couple of these races it would be a very different story today for our interest in the olympics and nbc right now hes beyond a star hes the most famous person in the world michael phelps of north baltimore
4015586 the combination of the michael phelps and fellow baltimore olympian katie hoff aspect and the intrigue of beijing we knew interest would be really high but this has exceeded expectations
4015587 this has been one of the busiest weeks i think ive ever experienced
4015588 honestly the only olympic games i can remember where a story captured a local markets interest like this was nancy kerrigan in boston back in 1994
4015589 i really believe now its fair to say that this olympics has become a really significant cultural event that the country is sharing
4015590 and honestly you almost never get that in this day of fractionalized audiences and fractionalized media
4015591 i saw two people park a motorcycle next to this building there was a package about this big on the back of the bike
4015592 i thought this was strange and went over to check it out the people who parked the motorcycle suddenly jumped into a red volkswagen and sped off
4015593 the police shot and killed eight terrorists they captured two and two others blew themselves up
4015594 the police rescued 13 trapped residents and seized 10 homemade bombs three suspects remain at large
4015595 but one thing we know about terrorists is that while they may be few in number and primitive in their means they can often achieve sensational results
4015596 this is an ethnic minority region our customs should be respected we should be trusted
4015597 now its like whatever bad things happen its always the minorities that get blamed
4015598 id like to go see the olympics in beijing but i wont have the opportunity
4015599 i want to apologize for the disruption and difficulty this issue may have caused to our customers and our partners
4015600 we failed in not disabling the code in the final release of update 2 and not catching it in our quality assurance process
4015601 we have kicked off a comprehensive in depth review of our qa and release processes and will quickly make the needed changes
4015602 i updated one of my five hosts and everything appears to be fine so far
4015603 thanks for all the hard work getting this patch out unfortunately i think youve gotten a serious black eye today we were finally getting management happy with the idea of using esx for production servers and this set us back a little bit
4015604 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorized consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
4015605 this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with hyper v vmware ran face first into the very hurdle it was trying to clear
4015606 this will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise

4015608 liege played well from what i saw but you do think theyve missed their best opportunity liverpool should win the home leg
4015609 spurs must be licking their lips and smelling blood after this tonight
4015610 liverpool are lucky not to be losing suddenly the 18m we spurs got for keane is looking like a great sale
4015611 i find some of the efforts to be quoted on the main champions league page a little painstaking
4015612 liverpool are absolutely shocking andrea dossena is terrible along with the rest of the defence flat up front and non existent in midfield the worst 45 minutes of their season by far
4015613 will liverpool still be so keane torres t gerrard in the second half
4015614 shock liverpool survive an over the line but not counted incident in the champions league deja vu anyone
4015615 i think arsenal would be better off with alf ramsey playing rather than aaron ramsey
4015616 has benitez orchestrated this pathetic display to demonstrate to parry hicks etc how much he needs barry hes better off at villa
4015617 how many free kicks is alonso going to waste before he lets someone else take one its called beckham syndrome i believe
4015618 see 2017 superb pun on ramsey it dossena get better than that
4015619 im not sure thatll be the peak of dantes career
4015620 see 1932 its my name it is welsh i am welsh just like ramsey

4015638 my doctor said i needed to stop running and quit doing impact sports and i handled it real well

4015651 yes it had been taken care and its done well not yet until you give that to uni

4015717 this is the first step in moving forward to full democracy
4015718 a lot of people voted yes not completely because they backed the charter but just because they wanted new election on december
4015719 i dont think this constitution will do anything for the poor it will only benefit the rich

4015745 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
4015746 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
4015747 there is no doubt that fadel shanas death is a tragedy
4015748 a journalist in action was killed by idf fire along with others not involved in the hostilities
4015749 however the available evidence does not suggest misconduct or criminal misbehavior i have therefore decided that no further legal measures will be taken
4015750 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analyzed clearly
4015751 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
4015752 long line of cases clearing its soldiers of deadly negligence
4015753 the army is obligated to clearly identify its targets before firing especially in areas where civilians and journalists are present the mere suspicion of possible hostilities should not be enough to justify overwhelming deadly force
4015754 we hope that the armys conclusion does not appear to give soldiers free license to fire without being sure of the target greatly hindering the medias ability to cover the conflict
4015755 these findings mean that a journalist with a camera is at risk of coming under fire and theres not that much that can be done thats unacceptable
4015756 its difficult to believe that the idf took the necessary precautions to avoid causing harm to civilians as it is obliged to do under international law

4015778 the economic development in the second quarter was markedby declining consumption by private households and diminishedplant investment
4015779 construction investment was in particular significantlylower than in the first quarter
4015780 foreign trade wasa positive contributor which can above all be attributed to asignificant fall in imports
4015781 given our pleasing performance in the first half year weconsider it justifiable to raise our pre tax profit forecast forthe group to over one billion euros

4015807 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4015808 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4015809 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4015810 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4015811 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4015812 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4015813 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4015814 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4015815 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4015816 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4015817 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4015818 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4015824 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4015825 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4015836 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee

4015849 the economic development in the second quarter was marked by declining consumption by private households and diminished plant investment
4015850 construction investment was in particular significantly lower than in the first quarter
4015851 foreign trade was a positive contributor which can above all be attributed to a significant fall in imports
4015852 this reassessment and modification of the earnings target are the result of a changed overall economic situation and more particularly of the earnings weakness in the department store business in germany
4015853 the automotive industry has taken a lead role in selecting robots as their preferred flexible automation solution
4015854 industries other than automotive need to realize the benefits that robots can add to their manufacturing processes robots are accurate flexible programmable can work in environments not suited for humans and more importantly they are repeatable with a high degree of accuracy these attributes directly contribute to end product quality which in turn reduces scrap and rework a requirement of lean manufacturing
4015855 avoid the mistake of buying a robot and just being content with the expectation that lean process results will automatically occur
4015856 improve the task or process before automating it and get your organization to agree to the cultural shift that a lean commitment requires only then will robot tending of a machine tool or process pay off
4015857 go beyond merely accepting verbal claims from the engineering department despite their assurances on lean we often discover that machine operators are compensating for a whole host of inefficiencies in the cell
4015858 in at least 70 of our robot implementations we find that production management may not be fully aware of the cell operating deficiencies that operators have to contend with
4015859 the conventional goals are double digit performance gains otherwise nothing is done and with robots in an opportunistic sense u s users tend to look at the automatons as a solution while theyre actually only potential opportunities
4015860 correctly assessing the lean opportunity for robots is a significant consideration both for the customer and for us
4015861 a proper lean analysis may show that there is not case for a robot implementation

4015914 i was of course curious what had happened to the hotel which in my opinion and some others i read is perfectly located close to a beautiful beach and as i searched for answers i came across an answer not so shocking in these days when it comes to people money the two male owners of the hotel resort had secretly stolen money from the profits without either one knowing the other one also did so of course this couldnt go on forever and somehow they were exposed the fighting between them resulted in more disappearance of cash and finally they both left the resort the staff struggled against the authorities to run the place and kept the resort going for another 4 5 months after the disappearance of the owners but they couldnt afford to pay rent for none of these months if you have something on the beach a monthly beach license fee must also be paid and they couldnt afford this either finally the police had to throw them out a deadline was given for the staff and guests and then the place was left quiet and empty but the contract for the resort rent paid or not stretched over 10 years and in greek law this means the resort cannot be demolished the spooky empty resort must stand its ground for the entire period of its contract only after a couple of days of emptiness people started to loot and trash whatever was left and the place slowly turned into the ruins they are today a very sad story i must say and i visuallized myself starting it up again a very costly and risky business to get oneself into but as the contract period expires which was any time now im sure someone with solid finances will start something again hopefully something as beautiful as you describe aptera was in its time of glory this information i gathered from locals living there and it seem logical but of course one cant be sure its 100 true
4015915 ive had so many positive experiences here on the many book tours that have taken me through town and i know and i like a lot of the chefs around here just timing thats all
4015916 hot dougs 3324 n california ave 773 279 955 im a huge fan you cant praise the place enough i hope theres never a backlash because of them being too popular or anything they are wonderful in every way the classic red hot is superb and i dont have to tell you how good the duck fat fries are but interestingly its the foie gras hot dog that stands out for me it sounds gimmicky but its a really cohesive dish i love the place
4015917 i did thats the one high end place i went there with le bernardin chef eric ripert who hadnt eaten there you have to understand every month that laurent gras has not had a place of his own has been torment for a lot of serious foodies out there and more significantly for chefs this is a guy with a tremendous amount of respect among chefs logic dictates he should have a place and it should be full i hope chicago knows how lucky it is to have him in town

4015980 zeer rustig soms zelfs iets te rustig hij slaat soms wat laat met de vuist op tafel dat zal wel nodig zijn de belastingdienst is heel goed in innen maar nog niet in verstrekken er zal ongetwijfeld nog wel wat mis gaan sijstermans zal zich vooral op de hoofdlijnen moeten richten

4015988 but dont you think its wrong the way he talks to people
4015989 my boss helen talks to me that way every day
4015990 a lot of the frameworks and walls built because of the old financial world we grew up in will come down
4015991 people think theyre diversifying by investing in a country and it leads to inadequate diversification
4015992 because the country of origin or incorporation is not the primary influence on the stock price
4015993 well be thinking in terms of global markets all the time
4015994 if you have young people in india africa or latin america borrowing from the wealthy
4015995 during the first quarter aspocomp forged ahead with the restructuring started up in late 2007 and risk management measures the groups structure has been streamlined the subsidiaries in oulu and thailand operate independently the number of staff in central functions has been reduced in line with the plans and cad planning department part of oulu plant will be closed by the end of the year
4015996 digital piracy continues to represent the primary challenge to online music service providers
4015997 other obstacles still include the lack of interoperability between services and devices due to differing digital rights management drm technologies and weak consumer demand for subscription based services another potential market inhibitor is the fact that content owners cellular service providers and handset manufacturers are increasing the amount of marketing and promotion for mobile music
4015998 although we used the word hate at one end of the continuum to assess emotional feelings toward other groups many children insisted outright in surveys and workshops that they hated no one
4015999 how do you feel about people who dont come from sa
4016000 it suggests that there is a large constituency whose views are undecided unshaped inarticulate contingent conditional and ultimately available to be swayed by circumstances
4016001 these are the classic bystanders that history shows to be fertile ground for political demagogues or others who trade in the business of prejudice
4016002 even more disturbing is that few among this tiny minority with faith in the country can articulate why they feel so
4016003 by way of contrast masses of adolescents irrespective of origin label crime violence economic circumstances lack of service delivery and governmental ineptitude and corruption when questioned on the key performance indicators of our national failures

4016006 i felt tired before the competition but after it i feel relaxed
4016007 i thought a month ago if i would get this medal i would be every emotional
4016008 but im really not because we won the team gold medal
4016009 but he handled it like a champion and i respect him very much
4016010 the judges decided to hold me and i guess i just let my nerves get the best of me
4016011 i have to put my mind in a little box and ignore the bad things going on around me
4016012 i think over the next few days the biggest thing is going to be trying to get as much rest as i can if i can do that ill be fine
4016013 wed really like to get to the breeders cup with this horse and we thought if we run well up there wed be sure of getting in
4016014 showing the world that chinas womens gymnastics is the greatest
4016015 but one of the little girls has a missing tooth
4016016 weve coordinated for more than 20 months thats all for this event this gold is so important to my life
4016017 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
4016018 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
4016019 his most productive days in the nba were just a few short years ago when he had ray allen on one wing and rashard lewis on the other wing
4016020 here you say you have michael redd on one wing and richard jefferson on another wing youre putting luke ridnour in the best possible position to be successful again as he has been in the past
4016021 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back
4016022 if they are georgian they certainly would be influenced but theyre not
4016023 i dont think they even know who the georgian president is
4016024 right now even a little success for us is very important
4016025 the athletes they cant concentrate our judo wrestlers they lost
4016026 the athletes are too distracted thinking about whats happening at home
4016027 its absolutely crazy we know that some of them lose their friends their family members this win maybe it will help us
4016028 im very proud today not only because it was against russia its a tough competition
4016029 i want to compliment them despite where we come from today we had a good match back there
4016030 i dont want this to become a war between us i respect them as players
4016031 i want you not to make like a continue of the war its just a game
4016032 i hope the conflict ends many of my relatives live in georgia
4016033 the extradition procedure is difficult complicated and time consuming and we cannot predict the timetable extradition is a very sensitive international legal issue so it will require close consultation with britain
4016034 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose
4016035 russian incursions into georgia from south ossetia or from abkhazia are contrary to international law the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people rightly
4016036 i cant say if the card was justified or not because i didnt see the play but it is extremely difficult to play a game when you lose a man by the fourth minute
4016037 it changed the game completely the lineup is affected the whole mentality is in the trash maybe the referee made a rash decision but thats behind us and theres nothing we can do
4016038 i didnt expect this kind of reaction from the ref three minutes into a game its unacceptable
4016039 he was a sensible caring athletic director and i loved being his neighbor at ingraham
4016040 we will miss him at the table he always listened to all sides then made thoughtful decisions that were spot on
4016041 we came back against their closer they came back against our closer
4016042 we continue to stress our defense and really work hard at that end of the floor
4016043 oh well records are meant to be broken it feels good but we just wanted to get the win we wanted to come out and perform well
4016044 the initial indication is that there wasnt much angler effort for the reopener and the catches werent great
4016045 i dont anticipate any early closures and it will go through friday the absolute final day of hatchery chinook fishing with no worries
4016046 there are some kings around at west point south of shilshole bay and i wouldnt say tons of fish but enough to keep it interesting
4016047 weve been getting four or five bites a day and sometimes we get all hatchery marked chinook keepers fish with a missing adipose fin and then the next day theyre all wild fish that we have to release
4016048 we checked 109 boats with 40 kings and nine coho this past monday and it hasnt been that bad
4016049 the tribes are doing their full fishery again last night in the bay
4016050 i think the catches are improving somewhat in area 11 and looking at the catch rates they are right around where they were last year
4016051 the mark rate for hatchery chinook is still holding around 82 to 84 percent i would expect next week to be the peak of the king fishery
4016052 we will look at ilwacos quota on friday and sunday could be the last day of fishing or it could close earlier
4016053 they ilwaco anglers had a big monday of fishing there and that did them in we had a coho per person tuesday and almost a coho and a half per person on monday
4016054 we fished makkaw bay tuesday and caught three kings and then headed out to table top and got seven coho up to 12 pounds
4016055 on sunday we ended up seeing four fish caught inside the bay compared to last week when all the fish were caught off washaway beach
4016056 private boats at both ports were getting seven tuna per person and charters at westport were getting 200 or more fish on their overnight trips
4016057 they are traveling 25 to 35 miles out of ilwaco and 50 miles out of westport
4016058 buoy 10 is starting to heat up for salmon and an oregon check showed some definite signs of improvements
4016059 checks showed about a third of a fish kept per rod the commercial fishery was good and they saw some kings in the 40 pound range
4016060 we still have a lot of guys fishing the local lakes for trout and lake washington is seeing some really good days for cutthroat pushing up toward 5 pounds
4016061 kokanee fishing is on again and off at lake stevens with fish in the 15 to 18 inch range trolling deep in 55 to 65 feet of water
4016062 i heard effort dropped off since the chinook fishery closed on aug 9 but they are seeing some nice hatchery coho around sekiu
4016063 nunca ha venido a comer ac ese se or ac s lo se venden men s de 4 soles
4016064 jam s puedo hacer esa cantidad a menos que haya vendido comida a un colegio entero
4016065 la ruta que ha determinado la comisi n apec en lima para el traslado de los delegados va desde el aeropuerto hac a el valo huanchaco ingresando hacia la v a de evitamiento a trav s de la cual se cruza el distrito v ctor larco para ingresar al hotel el golf donde se hospedar n
4016066 asimismo estamos preparando una exposici n sobre los productos de la regi n la cual se presentar en el patio interior del hotel el golf para que todos los funcionarios conozcan lo que se produce en estas tierras norte as
4016067 we have to be happy but there is still room for improvement we are not through because in football anything can happen
4016068 the team played well we were united and we kept the ball playing across the pitch and when we lose possession we won it back quickly
4016069 we cannot compare this with last season guardiola is full of desire like the players i think he can teach us a lot
4016070 the team left a good impression we are still playing in pre season
4016071 we do not know if the tie has been settled it is more important that we did not concede a goal but we have to be careful because this team can still surprise us
4016072 i think that the ovation was for the whole team because everyone wanted the team to play like that people have enjoyed it
4016073 coaches have to put their neck on the line signing young players and youve got to as a player prove them right and make the club see he made the right decision
4016074 by him signing me that gives me confidence and obviously hes got that belief in me from then so just to prove him right is always nice
4016075 they look for those sort of things and obviously if you really want it youll hang around like i did
4016076 i was here for about a month and it wasnt like after two weeks i was saying tell me tell me i had to listen to what they had to say and just do what they said
4016077 at the end of the day i wanted it and i knew what i wanted and if i kept staying here i had a chance and it worked out well
4016078 i think that theyre the sort of things that people dont realise what players go through
4016079 everyone thinks its sort of a glamorous life but i came over and i was staying with a boy and his girlfriend in a one bedroom unit and this units like the size of the change room a tiny room
4016080 and then i was supposed to be getting the nod this week and then it went another week and another week and psychologically it really gets you
4016081 continue to explore all available options in order to add an additional big man to our roster
4016082 unbelievable a good deal for the sixers if they win
4016083 luckily there are incentive clauses i guess 80 million wasnt enough thank goodness there are incentives
4016084 in times like these it all sounds like monopoly money but this is the market its not out of line from either side this is a case where both sides won you cant say iguodala lost and the sixers know what theyre doing ed stefanski has done a pretty good job of turning this around hes a very straight shooter the sixers know what iguodala meant to the franchise
4016085 im a little shocked but this is a lot of money but iguodala made out by gambling i didnt think hed get that much hes a good player and hed be in the rotation of all the teams but there are teams he wouldnt start for to me its a lot for a guy who hasnt been an all star who hasnt been out of the first round of the playoffs
4016086 the extradition procedure is difficult complicated and time consuming and we cannot predict the timetable extradition is a very sensitive international legal issue so it will require close consultation with britain
4016087 at the age of 7 months babies will watch a fearful face for longer than a happy face and their attentiveness level as measured by eeg is higher after seeing a fearful than a happy face
4016088 by contrast infants aged 5 months watch both faces when they are shown side by side for just as long and there is no difference in the intensity of attention in favour of the fearful face
4016089 our interpretation of this is to suggest that the brain mechanisms that specialise in emotional response and especially in processing threatening stimuli regulate and intensify the processing of facial expressions by age 7 months
4016090 we already know that furin seems to have roles in a variety of human diseases such as cancer cystic fibrosis and infectious diseases these findings show that having no furin in certain immune system cells can increase the immune response and lead to autoimmune disease in mice
4016091 inhibiting furin has been thought to reduce growth of malignant cells or to block infections by preventing essential activation of a pathogen however these results suggest that the development of drug interventions could have an unexpected side effect of increasing the risk of developing autoimmune disease
4016092 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose
4016093 russian incursions into georgia from south ossetia or from abkhazia are contrary to international law the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people rightly
4016094 through the first version of genomic pioneers we intend to elucidate the wide ranging utilities and applications of oligonucleotides and how it happens to be a bridge between basic research and target discovery we hope this award will be a trend setter and would encourage new avenues of industry industry and industry academia collaboration
4016095 we hope that this will also inculcate new practices in industrial social responsibility and this is our way of reaching out to the community which we all belong to
4016096 girls want to make sure they stay looking young from an early age
4016097 its just tragic thats all i can say about it
4016098 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
4016099 its so painful for her to see the father of her children become a pariah
4016100 they broke up a bunch of times especially when elizabeth was rediagnosed with cancer
4016101 withholding all gummy worms both regular and sour until we have a state budget
4016102 these low cost amplifying devices can look tempting to individuals with hearing impairment because of the significant cost differences but our research found that the low cost aids generally dont meet the fitting requirements to help a hearing impaired person and could potentially damage a persons hearing
4016103 aside from being of extremely poor quality very low cost hearing aids those under 100 dollars have the potential to damage your hearing because they send very loud sounds into the ear the studys mid range hearing aids 100 to 500 dollars were of higher quality and were not considered a safety hazard
4016104 based on the research the best advice for consumers is to talk to an audiologist because hearing aids have complex technical features they need to be fitted and customized to the individual
4016105 currently more than 32 million people have a hearing impairment yet only about 25 percent of those use hearing aids meanwhile the aging population is growing and hearing loss becomes more common as we become older
4016106 i was shocked and dismayed that something like that would have happened
4016107 at the very least you would think that california strategies would reveal their potential conflict of interests
4016108 i understand the confusion because the early media report mischaracterized the nature of these separate agreements
4016109 our advocates are lobbying on behalf of the city and the city only and we are proud to represent them through this fiscal crisis
4016110 separate and apart from that our consulting firm had an agreement to provide strategic consulting advice to the developer were talking about different clients different contracts no one at this firm has ever lobbied for mr keenan nor has mr keenan attended any lobbying meetings
4016111 its in the citys interest to get ab 1991 passed
4016112 its also in my interests we have a community of interest the way jason characterized it is exactly right
4016113 im just really not clear on how thing works up there i felt i needed guidance
4016114 in every field you can imagine there is always the general principle that you cannot serve two masters
4016115 if this conflict of interest was not a big issue then why not reveal it
4016116 its been clear that this isnt going to go through the senate without some changes
4016117 whose interest is areias representing there is a clear divergence there
4016118 people felt that charities should have a source of revenue so theyre not always out there with their hand out
4016119 these are the same arguments made against the tribes and the tribes prevailed now the tribes are making the same arguments these are not slot machines these are legal bingo machines just like the tribes have
4016120 were not operating under the same laws you cant compare them
4016121 substitute computers with stored bingo matrices do not qualify as the game of bingo
4016122 children who consumed 2 or more servings of dairy and 4 ounces of meat or other non dairy protein had bone mineral contents over 300 grams higher than those children with lower intakes of both dairy and other proteins
4016123 dairy is a key source of proteins calcium and other micronutrients including phosphorus and vitamin d
4016124 what difference is their game versus baseball or any other game that goes on there nothing else closes down the road canadian football games dont close down the road
4016125 you are not ready to do anything but drink beer and party when you are 19 but you are thrust into the frying pan and you do what you have to do
4016126 running the company has been all ive known for 20 plus years
4016127 you could stay there and do well or make other moves and do great i never get complacent and i dont think ive ever been satisfied in my life so to put the business in a coast mode would not be my nature
4016128 many french people feel that this project dirties our cultural heritage
4016129 but i am completely shocked by its eruption in versailles a magical sacred place contemporary art inseminates distraction and destructuring in a perfect ensemble in a beauty thats complete
4016130 the tourist who comes from china or australia will leave with this unheard of image of france even for three months koons in versailles is a mistake
4016131 they are pieces of furniture monsters mountains of muscle as if there were a competition among the publishers as if they had misunderstood the word coffee table book and put all their ambition into printing books as big as the tables themselves
4016132 that the books are sometimes made in a trashy a given
4016133 that many of these big volumes pay homage to reveling in sexual fetishes only shows that many of the fattest ones function like fetishes themselves they are admired as lifeless objects
4016134 de intellectualization in the field of serious art and design books
4016135 must haves for younger target groups the books are there for showing off
4016136 bragging is all about showing who has the longest the fattest the heaviest
4016137 in the world of fashion dubai is at the moment but a bud ready to blossom
4016138 it hasnt got any better and it hasnt got any worse
4016139 ive never started a negotiation where the solution was apparent from the beginning
4016140 im not bringing solutions that were found in other areas and expecting that they will work here
4016141 the solution here is going to be the result of the work that is done here
4016142 hopefully hes our man who can move some of these claims forward and get some resolved
4016143 the notion they dont even know where these sites are is even more disturbing than the fact they seem to inspect them every three years
4016144 so far this arrangement has been pretty effective other than this incident
4016145 if that means something needs to change with regards to the tssa we will look at all that
4016146 its time for the government to acknowledge that this experimentation this flirtation with privatization has been a failure
4016147 if we felt those were of sufficient magnitude that required an increased level of actions then certainly we would have taken them at the time
4016148 business records change on a continuous basis like any data i know that we make every effort to be as current as possible
4016149 que ninguna familia pague nada y a nadie hasta no estar dentro de su vivienda y est haciendo el papeleo de propiedad no paguen para comprar terrenos por proyectos ni por adjudicaci n
4016150 created a mess thats going to ripple down to every part of the economy
4016151 did anyone consider the big picture effect this will have on california
4016152 if they think theyve got problems with mortgage foreclosures now they aint seen nothin yet
4016153 the state gets a bargain and a half from us and the permanent employees appreciate us because theres too much work for them they dont resent us they appreciate us
4016154 bring together the states preeminent colleges universities and laboratories to fight climate change
4016155 sixty million dollars a year to deal with the greatest challenge of our times
4016156 this is obviously an issue that was raised right from the very start of the proceeding there is nothing new in there our attorneys examined the arguments that they legislative counsel raised and did not find them persuasive we do indeed think we have the authority to protect ratepayers in the short term and in the longer term
4016157 we want to try and make sure that these advanced ideas are manufactured here in california and that we are able to export that new high technology around the world climate change technology will be invaluable
4016158 broad based funding source so all californians are chipping in
4016159 and now the climate institute we are getting a feeling on the legislative side that our only alternative is to exercise more vigorous oversight because counting on you to communicate directly to this committee or the senate on what your proposal is and your plans going doesnt seem to be happening
4016160 the polls might be transient blip cause by high gas prices
4016161 certainly there is bipartisan opposition to offshore drilling democrats and republicans at both the state and federal levels and the governor are opposed to drilling if we approved more offshore drilling it might bring down the cost of gasoline by a few cents a gallon in 10 years from now but we can do a lot more than through efficiency
4016162 the drilling is in state waters and this decision could be made at the state level
4016163 all youre doing is putting california at a competitive disadvantage with foreign oil we will import more foreign oil into california it makes no sense from a tax policy standpoint it doesnt make sense from a national security standpoint
4016164 we end up replacing oil that would have been imported in supertankers that would be a lot more environmentally sensitive than burning up all that fuel to bring the oil in from 8 000 miles away we desperately need new revenue from non tax and non fee sources it has routinely been brushed aside before but some of these ideas are going to be brought up again
4016165 we appear to be the only place in the world that does not collect taxes or royalties on oil production
4016166 while oil is a declining resource in california there still are very large reserves of heavy oil so at these high oil prices revenues will continue for a long time
4016167 we see it over the whole park not just a single trail
4016168 its hard to make generalisations it can depend heavily on species as some are more affected by recreation than others
4016169 were not in any way advocating that people stop seeing nature but were trying to heighten the awareness of site managers to these unexpected impacts on wildlife
4016170 would authorize any local agency that maintains a community sewer system to take action to control residential salinity inputs including those from water softeners
4016171 one percent of water users are creating 10 percent of the salinity that 100 percent of us have to pay to clean up
4016172 the current law gives water softeners a carve out it basically says you have to have studies that address every other salinity issue before you get to water softeners this evens the playing field and allows this to be dealt with at the local level nobody has proposed mandatory removal of water softeners it requires compensation
4016173 please tell us by the demonstrable failure in existing law
4016174 every time you flush your toilet every time you brush your teeth every time you take a shower thats a residential input
4016175 were 90 days out from the general election so its really crunch time
4016176 six current members a couple of non profit organizations and a couple of candidates
4016177 a lot has to happen in a short period of time
4016178 you have to be detail oriented you have to plan the events make mail lists track food and location costs set it up hand out name tags clean up if necessary make follow up calls
4016179 for sit down dinners you have to think about seating arrangements i like cocktail parties theyre easier
4016180 we sit down at the end of the year and develop a strategy for the following year
4016181 were just trying to be creative and different when we decide what kind of events to do weve done everything from spa days to the garlic gala
4016182 we plan events that are not too expensive not too time consuming not too much of a commitment but mostly events that are fun
4016183 weve had the legislature members cook and be a chef for a day weve had them play mini golf one of my favorites was the ten buck buffet at buds for darrell steinberg
4016184 i like to base the ideas on something unique about the candidate
4016185 steve knights dad always used to have beer and a hot dog with everyone he met so we had fun with
4016186 ive been in fundraising for 22 years and before this i was a campaign finance director so i can offer a more comprehensive type of service
4016187 rarely will people just send you money to help you out
4016188 people like to go to events so most of the money comes from those
4016189 the best part is the relationships that you build learning about everybody
4016190 we had nerves in our first game but against argentina we were outstanding and we were outstanding again today
4016191 hes a big player and he made all the difference today weve had problems scoring with this team this is generally a problem with all levels of australias national teams
4016192 disappointment aside i am proud of the work the players put in and i think we have developed as a team
4016193 we improved with every game here but we just came up a little short
4016194 has the presidential campaign devolved to the frivolous mccain depicts obama as a star and obama sinks in the polls obama returns fire with mccain as a mere beltway star and mccain is rattled so whats wrong with being a star
4016195 weve been training since may and weve had a lot of games which is great with a lot of great performances and overall its been a good pre season
4016196 to understand a few things but based on the information the jury received it was a fair verdict
4016197 the information and demonstration given regarding an iard response was very helpful
4016198 now in its fifth year the vh1 hip hop honors has come to represent the pinnacle of innovation and achievement in hip hop music
4016199 this years five honorees are no different and are being recognized for their significant contributions to hip hop culture and for helping to elevate hip hop into a truly global phenomenon
4016200 recently there has been a lot of focus on piracy but this deal is reflective of the radically changing digital landscape where music fans can access high quality safe and legal alternatives were very excited to be partnering with warner music and are looking forward to offering first class content from their impressive roster of local and international acts on we7 com where music fans get great music for free that they can listen to when they want and the choice to buy the music they love

4016203 in view of the crew safety we are unable to provide further details
4016204 we hope the un and the coalition forces will stop the attacks unless there is a deterrent the attacks and hijacking will continue to escalate

4016208 food security in the philippines is projected to remain stable
4016209 our businesses have been equipped to sail through headwinds of spiraling fuel and food prices and changing consumer patterns we continue to take a long term perspective so that we view the market turbulence as being temporary as such we remain on course as far as our expansion program is concerned

4016296 everybodys sick of it going nowhere and realizes we have to do it together i hope somebody breaks out of here its just a matter of plugging away getting out there and getting known

4016301 it works out for me i get to leave stockton enough that i dont really get crazy
4016302 youd have a public outcry if you cited everybody who did not come to a complete stop the real question is whether that behavior is causing problems
4016303 i appreciate all you guys taking the time to be here
4016304 and begin discussions on the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
4016305 there is no surer index of the degree of civilization of a community than the manner in which it treats its organic wastes
4016306 they should have wiped out the shareholders nationalized the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted as five or 10 individual privately held units

4016308 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4016309 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond

4016314 you may reassign a software license but not on a short term basis i e not within 90 days of the last assignment
4016315 technically the virtual machine would have to remain on the same physical machine for three months
4016316 within a few months were going to see those changes
4016317 virtualization licensing and support lethargy curing the disease that stalls virtualization adoption
4016318 allowing standard edition windows server os licenses to be assigned directly to a vm and move with a vm without restriction is all that is needed for microsoft to offer the most nearly ideal licensing terms
4016319 vendors are working hard to come up with schemas that work well and are fair to them and the end customer
4016320 youve got the ability to spin up additional virtual machines as your processing demands increase
4016321 the difficulty with software licensing is how you keep track of how many virtual machines how many applications or how many iterations of the operating system youre running at any time its an interesting can of worms
4016322 its very inconvenient well probably have to address the issue at some point
4016323 there are still vendors who have no clearly defined licensing policy for virtual environments
4016324 you have to pay for all available cpus on a physical server
4016325 we have an enterprise site license for oracle so its not really an issue
4016326 as you start to deploy virtual machines you are deploying more operating systems that need to be licensed and metered
4016327 every time you tell your systems management tool that you want to spin up a new virtual machine all of a sudden youre deploying operating system and application licenses to people whether you like it or not
4016328 it would be really nice if we could just have a very simple licensing model thats not the case today
4016329 they are selling technology into a space that is need to have and must have technology to keep businesses running
4016330 stop it this makes me sick this circular firing squad that is occurring is unattractive unprofessional unconscionable and unacceptable

4016332 this is my first adventure as a true warehouse manager which is an amazing honor
4016333 we anticipate 24 percent of our transactions will go through those lanes
4016334 its really fun everybodys just so excited they are very welcoming to their employees its a comfortable company to work for
4016335 i think were going to be fine we have quality products at great prices were just going to look ahead were not going to look back
4016336 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow
4016337 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a paedophile
4016338 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money
4016339 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4016340 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet
4016341 im not saying its impossible but i dont think it will happen
4016342 washburn came and asked me can you tell me who claimed me
4016343 i dont know anything about that i havent heard anything like that i gotta believe this time of year a lot of guys are placed on waivers a lot of guys get claimed i think thats probably pretty routine
4016344 you gotta hope whatever happens its for the best of the organization and best for all of us
4016345 but if it has to be one way of another everybody kind of feels itd be in the bullpen
4016346 brandon is pretty good back there im still learning from him actually
4016347 this summer and everything were trying to work hard on that making it a strong priority
4016348 i feel like i have quick feet to break to the ball but i have a lot of room to improve in a lot of spots
4016349 as long as im on the field to help my team it would be a good year if theres any way possible to help them win and have a turnaround year im all right with that
4016350 the year to me is in reference to what year is it in terms of the inju ries one year its knees one year its ankles one year its hamstrings and right now we seem to have the hamstring year for us so it seems we have a few more of those than anything else but i dont think its any more overall injuries this year
4016351 but im not overly concerned about being healthy for the opener at oregon on aug 30 right now these things happen and the first thing in football is the next guy has got to be prepared to step up but i think well be ok come game time
4016352 if i could pick any position it would probably be tight end i really enjoy it i like blocking and i like catching i love catching
4016353 i feel like im the starter i dont need to worry about my spot as much i understand that were going to rotate im fine with that as far as my spot being taken im not worried about that
4016354 i think chris polk is doing some very good things at the running back position its still a thing that were trying to figure out how were going to utilize him best but he definitely has done some things well there and both johri fogerson and david freeman have shown some really good signs and terrance dailey is a little bit behind but hes learning also
4016355 its always sad to see one of your guys leave i wish he was here he was another speedy guy who could stretch out the field but now that hes gone we have guys who are going to step up
4016356 you cant replace him you just play in his spot everyone is stepping up to try and help
4016357 the big thing we wanted to do today was really start to set the tempo
4016358 thats what we talked about after practice the first thing we need to figure out is what full speed means
4016359 were taking it little by little but im catching on fast
4016360 a lot of the upperclassmen are helping me out if i have a question theyre there if i make a mistake a wrong call they are there
4016361 im going to be hard on the offense as far as i want to see perfection i think we had one bad snap and im telling them lets eliminate that i want them to strive for perfection
4016362 the thing ive really noticed is just how much talent we have on this team
4016363 everybody here is big and strong and fast there are a lot of good guys out here the competition for playing time isnt going to be a walk in the park

4016367 all journeys have secret destinations of which the traveler remains unaware
4016368 as far as what coach wants to do with that thats his decision
4016369 im just really trying to go out there and get this offense down and if he feels comfortable with me thats great
4016370 but my first couple of years in the league i played a lot of football so thats come in handy and helped me be comfortable out there and confident right now im still trying to learn this offense and take that next step of making my reads faster and making good deci sions
4016371 for me ive always just been excited to see him go
4016372 because charlies a guy thats played before when we practice he has a lot of experience from games in the past that he can draw upon and that shows some young guys and guys that are backups dont have that to work with but i think it helps him practice because hes been in some of these situations
4016373 its difficult to judge somebody when hes first coming in and learning a position but hes followed through and hes learned a new offense and those different things theres a big improvement from last year to this year
4016374 waiting for dinner spirits mine are low im feeling unattractive dumb and disrespected by my family by the world and possibly by me too

4016377 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
4016378 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
4016379 clearly it was inappropriate we understand the team has apologised and absolutely meant no offence whatsoever
4016380 during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked us to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with our eyes
4016381 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4016382 i want to express that we have great respect for the orient and its people some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin

4016389 i hate instant messengers these days the reason i hate them is because people dont have any courtesy when they use them they think that because its just a form of online social networking that they dont have to use the common courtesy that they use with people with whom they are speaking face to face heres some of the stuff thats been nagging me lately about ims scenario 1 you see a friend online on your im you send them a hi they respond and you start talking then your friend just stops answering you after 10 or 15 minutes go by you wonder if they are on the phone or working or something however an hour or more goes by and you notice that the person still shows as online yet you never once got an explanation from them for why they stopped talking to you

4016419 it would kind of be an insult to the system to not have at least an assault conviction out of this
4016420 mike was hit three times in the chest before he reacted he left the scene of the party

4016422 what the defendant failed to do however was to retreat from the house or walk away and call the police about the disturbance
4016423 because of his failure to take these steps the court cannot find that the self defense justification is available to permit the striking of jake
4016424 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4016425 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4016426 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4016427 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4016428 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4016429 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4016430 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4016431 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4016432 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4016433 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4016434 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4016435 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4016436 i have been voting democratic for 18 years i only voted for democrats from dog catcher to president and everything in between
4016437 i will be voting for someone other than barack obama come november
4016438 nosotros hemos jugado nuestro mejor partido en estos juegos ol mpicos

4016445 we have people in sacramento and in political offices that think that accountability is testing
4016446 teachers are so loaded down with tests they have very little time to teach anymore
4016447 its quite an extraordinary thing its the first time a preacher has convened the two presumptive candidates they are both fighting for that vote
4016448 mccain has a good record on that issue abortion and he must show that he will continue it as president
4016449 for mccain the aim will be to solidify evangelicals as a key constituency
4016450 for obama it is significant that he will be participating as an equal on the same stage as mccain in an evangelical church this signals the shift in the evangelical political landscape since 2004
4016451 this has a lot less to do with what is going on in california and more to do with what is going on in ohio pennsylvania and florida the big swing states
4016452 in all of these states there is a sizable evangelical population that does not directly identify with the old religious right
4016453 once you are aware of the full record in this case i am certain that you will agree that this young man should not be in prison
4016454 made it very clear that he would not plead to an assault charge of any kind
4016455 we would have certainly negotiated something else if they would have been willing to admit some responsibility but they never were

4016460 because of his failure to take these steps the court cannot find that the self defense justification is available to permit the striking of jake
4016461 hes frustrated and hes bored because he cant understand why hes there for defending himself
4016462 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration

4016479 ambition was an essential part of my unhappiness if i could function at all as a grown up i wanted to be one at whom the whole world marvelled and london in turn seemed marvellous to me stimulating and sating a thousand appetites
4016480 i thought then that i was not weeping for olof palme that perhaps no one in the crowd was doing that we wept for each other and for all the futures that would never be all the past that could not have been real for if it had been this could not have happened the country we had lived in was cracked open like a roofless house in winter
4016481 by the end of that decade the country no longer seemed safe prosperous or tolerant and even if at its core it still was those things the progress towards ever greater safety prosperity and tolerance had come to be a pious affirmation not a historical fact

4016488 i didnt care anything about it millikan said explaining why he attended only a few tournaments at forest oaks
4016489 id a lot rather be back here where i watched the tournament when i was 18 or 19 years old i like this course a lot better
4016490 its the whole style said doug tyla who caddied last year at forest oaks and is carrying ryan armours bag this week he was talking about the wealthy enclave that constitutes the sedgefield community
4016491 the houses around here are unbelievable he said of the enormous homes beside the fairways and elsewhere in the neighborhood
4016492 youll be seeing a lot of that clubhouse during the tournament
4016493 based on my review of the officers actions im confident they did the right thing
4016494 were seeing the real world response to make training fit into the real world and it isnt pretty
4016495 they are holding onto this man by his pants and standing in a circle like kids at a playground
4016496 the group has traded particularly well in the last quarter of its financial year and this combined with good trading conditions experienced throughout the financial year means that air partner now expects to report year end results ahead of current market expectations

4016503 people pretty much know all the places and times they can eat and especially the people living outside they go to the same places to eat every day
4016504 even if they are not homeless the gap between their income and their housing cost may be so big that they need to go to the food programs to be able to eat
4016505 they want to blend in they dont want people to really know how desperate their situation is but theyve got to feed their kids and themselves
4016506 there is still a bad stigma associated with community radio stations
4016507 media buyers still have doubts about spending money and investing on community radio stations
4016508 another thing that we have been told is that they can never trust that we are going to play their adverts we subscribe to aircheck which is a broadcast monitoring service provider that tracks and archives ads played on a daily basis and the overall effectiveness of an execution the methodology is rapid and reliable
4016509 with us being on the dstv bouquet it means clients will be able to listen to the station from anywhere in the country and will be able to check if their ads have been played on time

4016526 northeast i would say is an ideal trail for people with varied skill sets
4016527 its less technical than owls roost but it can be very fun and challenging based on the way the trails are laid out

4016581 the climate here is so much better than its portrayed

4016592 liefst anderhalve tot twee maanden vroeger dan pakweg tien jaar geleden
4016593 in juli zagen de bladeren van de populier al geel

4016598 following the recent cancellation of treasury shares novo a s has re aligned its shareholding in novo nordisk a s to the level of just over 25 which has been our target since the demerger of novozymes a s in 2000 we remain a committed long term majority shareholder of novo nordisk
4016599 i really feel this is going to be the start of something great
4016600 we appreciate the willingness of everyone at forest oaks to work with us in our efforts to move the wyndham championship to sedgefield
4016601 this process had a lot of moving parts which is why it took more than four months to make it happen at the end of the day we want to do anything we can to make the wyndham championship a plus plus in every way and the move to sedgefield is the latest step in that process
4016602 the beauty of sedgefield is the realm of the restoration
4016603 i am careful not to say we put the course exactly how donald ross had it we try to reinstate the thought process that he intended while making some minor adjustments to bring it in line with the modern player ross thought about golf shots he wanted his courses to be playable but wanted the player to hit a certain shot to get to a pin or an area of the fairway we brought that back
4016604 when pixar started there was no cg industry so we were in manufacturing
4016605 i hope the siggraph experience will help me better propel myself into the industry and hopefully help me be fully employed
4016606 i had a scholarship to vfs last year but couldnt make it up to canada this year siggraph is a great step forward for me
4016607 siggraph is honored to host this special advance screening at the festival
4016608 the star wars films have always been stellar examples of visionary visual effects seeing these effects paired with computer animation and the behind the scenes knowledge from dave filoni will be an incredible experience for fans and film professionals alike
4016609 as the field of computer graphics matures we will continue to see graphics practitioners take on novel challenges that were not even considered just a few years ago
4016610 the modeling and animation techniques used in spore will inspire others to think more creatively about user created content in computer games
4016611 i started with the soundtrack by mixing and re pitching various abstract sounds that i recorded
4016612 the idea being to create music from noises then i procedurally animated numerous abstract 3d objects to the track these animations are then used as source imagery to my 3d noise shaders which have parameters that animate to the soundtrack as well the camera travels through the resulting animated evolving volume i went back and forth between the sound and visuals as i would stumble upon cool moments in each and wanted to tie them together so that every sound event had a visual event and vice versa
4016613 one of the really interesting sets of papers are on what i characterize as gradient based illustration techniques
4016614 they offer very powerful techniques for image creation and editing the applications are as compelling as painting i expect these ideas to move from academia to the artist within a couple years
4016615 who would have guessed that face manipulation would be a trend this year
4016616 we look for novelty technical advancements the highest quality results
4016617 and the wow factor some people do things youd never think of like the bizarre self animating image
4016618 one that im excited about is a piece on digital cinematography
4016619 we have pixar and blue sky giving their approaches to cinematography and setting up camera rigs for wall e and horton and some work from ilm on their digital environments in indiana jones its an eye cracker on monday morning at 8 30 but ill be there and friday is character td day
4016620 someone could come in cold not knowing anything about stereo 3d and come out with an appreciation for the history and technical challenges
4016621 a fairly large group of us were having lunch during the jury meeting for the content of siggraph 08 and one person lamented that at the conference we go absorb information sit passively and listen and then leave were not creating anything we in this case refers to the research community so we talked about it
4016622 its totally freeform but i imagine people will exchange information at the meeting arrange to meet and in the meantime think about the problem
4016623 well give them problems that are grand in nature not something you could solve by writing a paper
4016624 this is a process that starts four years in advance and requires macro and micro management skills
4016625 also the roles that the chair has to fill are mind bogglingly vast
4016626 she has to be a visionary a strategist and a hands on implementer as well as a leader a manager a mentor and a friend all while holding down a day job thankfully the amazing conference team of volunteers and contractors makes meeting that impossibly tall order a possibility
4016627 we have an excellent collection of robotics demos and of course takeo kanade is a featured speaker presenting
4016628 its programmed as a true festival with not only screenings but also production sessions festival talks an entire 3d stereo cinematography track production studio evenings and a festival awards session
4016629 los angeles is really an incredibly popular city with attendees
4016630 that would be like saying the people who contribute and attend could grow to have too much passion and enthusiasm for their work
4016631 when i started my research position less than two years ago i was already deep into the conference planning cycle for 2008 and my managers have been extremely supportive
4016632 one of the exciting projects that they asked me to join within my first months was an academy of technology study on the future of research we interviewed researchers and lab directors both internal and external to ibm in industry and academia we asked them what they saw on the horizon for the next 10 years not just in terms of research topics but also in terms of the way people will be working in research environments our findings were very rich and we aim to publish our final report at the end of this year
4016633 we wanted to keep whats worked in the past but also push ourselves by making a more a festival environment for cg
4016634 it was really kinda supposed to be a quick peek
4016635 but as is the nature of a rabbitholes display once you turn the lights on well i warned him this place was going to go crazy
4016636 many of these cutting edge technologies exemplify how our past informs our future and how it affects the upcoming opportunities and challenges of computer graphics and interactive techniques
4016637 the technologies and installations in new tech demos encourage people to engage with the future as well as celebrate our past as we invigorate explore and define our potential

4016648 we do have credible reports that russia has taken actions that violate the cease fire agreement and thats what the president was referring to
4016649 i cant get into specifics but we do have those reports and were concerned about them and we are working to get concrete information its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
4016650 it is very difficult to get accurate in real time in a crisis that is fast moving
4016651 this is a motorized conflict in a relatively small area and that means the situation on the ground can change very quickly
4016652 i think this is a significant lack of policy and analysis
4016653 i think the administration has most of what they need
4016654 im sure we have a lot more information than theyre discussing publicly
4016655 bueno ya hice lo que quer a ahora lo que toca hacer es mantener el trabajo o la empresa

4016680 they had a great time together but they are just in different places in their lives right now
4016681 he likes to dwell on these relationships and sort everything out before saying goodbye for good
4016682 it is really a cooling off not this big dramatic break up
4016683 theres a swing in mood from supply concerns to falling demand particularly in the united states but attention is beginning to turn to europe and asian economies as well
4016684 arawak had an excellent first half of 2008 making good operational and financial progress and successfully expanding our asset base with strong earnings and cash flows we are looking to develop our exposure to the rich hydrocarbon reserves within our three core areas kazakhstan russia and azerbaijan the completion of our london listing complements our established listing in toronto and will allow us to develop twin bases of institutional investor support in these two important markets
4016685 alan brings with him extensive experience in running large scale international industrial companies and his experience in the oil and gas industry will make a very attractive addition to our board
4016686 keith has more than 30 years experience in the mining industry and is highly regarded in the international mining community his depth of senior management experience and knowledge of the industry will be an asset to the company
4016687 both alan and keith will be excellent additions to our board and we are very pleased that they have agreed to join us
4016688 we were very lucky to have got away with a draw very lucky not to have conceded goals
4016689 it was a very disappointing performance but the team know they have to improve and i did not have to say much to them in the dressing room sometimes you do not need many words
4016690 it will be different at anfield there we are expected to win and we will have our own fans behind us liege had their very noisy fans for the first leg
4016691 we were not surprised by the fine performance of the liege side we had seen enough of them to know they were a good aggressive side
4016692 the real surprise for me was the way we played the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
4016693 we were a very young team and we did not lose our nerve did not panic
4016694 in the end maybe our technical superiority allowed us to score two goals that is a massive advantage for the second leg but we will be on our toes
4016695 they imposed a very physical game on us with man marking all over the pitch they did that with a lot of belief and spirit
4016696 they had given so much in the first half they could not keep the same pace and tightness in their marking from then on we looked more comfortable
4016697 you saw a performance of great spirit and arsenal were rattled they know they have been in a game
4016698 we have made arsenal an offer which we feel is fair were not negotiating and were not falling out with arsenal if they dont accept the bid
4016699 arsenal are a good club to deal with and were both doing business the right way if they accept the bid then great if not then we move on
4016700 the deal we did for luke young was right for the club we were happy with it villa were happy it and the player was happy with it
4016701 since april frontera has been working to return to drilling operations as soon as possible at the c prospect but has encountered delays associated with obtaining the required drilling equipment in the current oil price environment during the delay however we have taken the opportunity to enhance our ongoing work by reprocessing our 3d seismic survey over the prospect this work will incorporate the actual results encountered from the well bores that have been drilled to date and provide the basis for continuation of drilling operations at the lloyd 1 location in addition reprocessing will yield a more accurate view of the subsurface for future drilling operations that will be designed to appraise the results obtained from our work at the c prospect thus far we remain extremely encouraged by our ongoing work at this important prospect

4016705 the asas decision to uphold the wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
4016706 there was anecdotal evidence that there were increasing incidents with school boards and jurisdictions and even outside of school boards
4016707 increasing incidences where numbers of people were being transported in vans without the safety they would have expected in a school bus
4016708 theyre trying to say if youre going to use a vehicle for the purpose of moving kids to sport outings it has to meet the same standards as a school bus
4016709 in a collision it provides greater protection to the occupants
4016710 the results and the records speak for themselves year after year championship after championship murray has built a culture of excellence he had a vision and he hires the right people to fulfill that vision from bob bowman to paul yetter to his coaches at the lower levels it wouldnt surprise me if he already had his eye on the next great coach
4016711 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
4016712 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
4016713 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
4016714 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised
4016715 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned
4016716 how can you hit and think at the same time
4016717 i was just eager to do my routine and get the show on the road
4016718 the judges decided to hold me and i guess i just let my nerves get the best of me
4016719 there was a two minute delay so the world feed could get alicias routine into the world feed
4016720 that was unfortunate but it is not unusual the hold could have had an effect on alicia
4016721 whether its deep breathing or imaging or a certain thought
4016722 once you are aware of the full record in this case i am certain that you will agree that this young man should not be in prison
4016723 made it very clear that he would not plead to an assault charge of any kind
4016724 we would have certainly negotiated something else if they would have been willing to admit some responsibility but they never were
4016725 it would kind of be an insult to the system to not have at least an assault conviction out of this
4016726 mike was hit three times in the chest before he reacted he left the scene of the party
4016727 i dont know what else mike could have done to avoid the situation
4016728 what the defendant failed to do however was to retreat from the house or walk away and call the police about the disturbance
4016729 because of his failure to take these steps the court cannot find that the self defense justification is available to permit the striking of jake
4016730 hes frustrated and hes bored because he cant understand why hes there for defending himself
4016731 sie behaupten das habe technische gr nde sie wollten das nutzungserlebnis auf dem iphone nicht von au enseitern durcheinanderbringen lassen
4016732 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4016733 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4016734 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4016735 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4016736 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4016737 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4016738 i have been voting democratic for 18 years i only voted for democrats from dog catcher to president and everything in between
4016739 i will be voting for someone other than barack obama come november
4016740 its tough but we just got our american record by four seconds so we cant really complain about it
4016741 the other teams just had a little more i did my best and ran out of room at the end its all i can do
4016742 trying to get as much rest and recovery in my system as possible tomorrow the 200 im is going to be a hard race and so is the 100 fly against ian crocker crocks been waiting around for this event so you know hes going to be ready to do something good
4016743 right now there is nobody that wants to win a gold medal at this meet more than katie hoff
4016744 the competition is tough in every race for me sometimes its not a good idea to swim so many events
4016745 its really important to focus on your main event not just try to win maybe five gold medals
4016746 i remember when matt biondi was supposed to win seven golds and he got a bronze in his first race and everyone asked are you disappointed
4016747 biondi said no i just want to win a gold medal you kind of have to look at it like that
4016748 everybody makes mistakes and it just took them awhile to make mistakes
4016749 at least they didnt know how to speak english just chinese
4016750 and theyd show it on sportscenter highlights or something like that
4016751 there are many different paths to take hilary was a divisioni swimmer whitney was swimming at age 14 in rome and michael is well hes michael
4016752 i swam in a meet at the end of the year
4016753 i ended up getting a third place trophy and i said to my mom i want a bigger trophy well honey these kids swim year round and they practice all the time that was it
4016754 because we were swimming since he was able to walk he was at meets all the time he kind of grew into it
4016755 they did a lot of watching after michael too certainly as far as swimming goes michael didnt know anything other than being intensely focused on swimming if his sisters were lackadaisical maybe he wouldnt be doing what hes doing but he never knew any other way to do it
4016756 she could train like no other girl ive ever seen
4016757 its just hard when you see these other people making it people you were swimming against and i had no control i couldnt control my back
4016758 but as i got older matured more i looked back on my career and realized i did a lot more than so many others i should be proud
4016759 i always wonder what a fourth child wouldve been like
4016760 because when i was younger i was gung ho about practice swimming was my life and i was a decent college swimmer then theres whitney who was a little more hesitant to start swimming and then she was really great
4016761 michael was different no way didnt want to put his face in the water i hate practice keep me away and now hes the best ever
4016762 to me its great to go to the events but to be honest i like it here
4016763 when you get to talk to these people if im at an event and i watch someone win a gold medal im in the stands and i dont get to really experience it
4016764 we probably shouldnt have but we read all of that stuff
4016765 there have been times when weve been doing the olympics where guys will come from the swimming pool with the gold medal around their necks and theyre still wet and they walked over and theyre just in a daze
4016766 america needs something that raises them up out of fear and uncertainty
4016767 i think most people look at china as a monolith as people exactly the same and thats not true
4016768 he has goals that he wants to accomplish everyone compares him to mark spitz but he wants to first be michael phelps and hes proving himself

4016804 each year as many as 50 infants are placed on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation but die while waiting owing to the lack of a suitable donor heart
4016805 frankly we are getting some significant interest in our asset sales including hummer but probably it wont be concluded imminently
4016806 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
4016807 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
4016808 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
4016809 it may still just be summer but there is a feeling of chill in the economic air
4016810 junes weak industrial production figures support our view that euro zone gross domestic product fell in the second quarter
4016811 the operating results are not in zells favour theyre not so draconian as to remove the positive of the cablevision sale so its a holding pattern
4016812 our publishing results are for the most part in line with industry trends which remain consistent with what we reported in the first quarter
4016813 every cloud has a silver lining in the case of a company like the bargain shop we are an extreme value retailer
4016814 in difficult economic times in particular with the increase in energy costs its something that coincides very well with our strong suit which is offering good quality merchandise close to peoples homes people want to save on gas
4016815 the whole category of giant tiger bargain shop dollar stores has been doing well and is likely to do better as the economy weakens
4016816 people of all income ranges are quite happy to shop at a dollar store in the morning and gucci in the afternoon
4016817 the level of excess capacity has shrunk down in the last few years to a level barely within the planning toleration of the industry
4016818 were to the point where we need every possible resource renewables demand response and energy efficiency nuclear clean coal you name it we need it
4016819 and we especially need the transmission lines that will bring the power generated by these new resources to consumers
4016820 if you dont have generation and transmission something has to give
4016821 the event was a major crisis and did probably force something to happen that would have otherwise not happened
4016822 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
4016823 and we are aware that the u s is uptight about this project
4016824 but a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts
4016825 lets be very clear whose interests are being served by the partnership that russia and the united states have engaged in on iran or north korea
4016826 america is losing the whole region and this is the region of eastern and central europe
4016827 this is much bigger than any other place where there is american influence and this is the most natural allies of america
4016828 there will be no compromise at the expense of our territorial integrity
4016829 i never accused the united states in the first place of anything
4016830 i just said that the russians mistook some of the statements at certain levels
4016831 i dont think you can have any doubt but that the united states has from the very beginning believed that the south ossetian situation needed to be resolved and resolved peacefully as weve been working for months and months and months to do but that russia seriously overreached that russia engaged in activities that could not possibly be associated simply with the crisis in south ossetia
4016832 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4016833 if i were a neighbor of russia and i saw what russia had done in georgia i would be very nervous
4016834 i think those countries that are leaning toward the west are very nervous today
4016835 if you guess wrong and go to the wrong place first you waste more time and it costs you extra in co pays and fees
4016836 independently we all were getting a little uncomfortable with the level of service that was being provided to the patients in the emergency room

4016842 the former friends star has been unable to find love since her divorce four years ago from brad pitt
4016843 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4016844 i have heard the russian president say that his military operations are over i am saying it is time for the russian president to be true to his word
4016845 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4016846 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
4016847 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4016848 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
4016849 we have no need nor do we intend to take over any georgian air or seaport to deliver humanitarian aid for those caught in this conflict it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
4016850 ive also been having conversations with senators obama and mccain
4016851 i know that they are at this moment of difficult diplomacy that they are doing what they can to support the efforts of the administration

4016853 the census bureau thursday released population projections through 2050 based on rates for births deaths and immigration they are subject to big revisions depending on immigration policy cultural changes and natural or manmade disasters
4016854 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years

4016863 clearly it was inappropriate we understand the team has apologised and absolutely meant no offence whatsoever
4016864 during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked us to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with our eyes
4016865 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4016866 i want to express that we have great respect for the orient and its people some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin
4016867 the democratic congress is not about to extend this program

4016873 is allowing special interest extremists in maricopa county to dictate his positions
4016874 hes trying very hard to portray himself as more conservative in the primary in hopes that people will believe it
4016875 mr melvin is bad for our party bad for our state and bad for district 26
4016876 it isnt the crime but the cover up that gets you
4016877 how would you feel if your husband cheated on you
4016878 we need a statewide plan to create functional new transportation corridors that serve growing communities
4016879 this plan must include not just necessary freeway construction but also transit options including a robust rail element because we simply cannot out freeway the problem

4016881 leaders at all ages have to be willing to hear the bad news over and over and still see a silver lining
4016882 do i detect any difference between now and when i was 70 a little but there is nothing significantly diminished
4016883 am i a better executive than i was at 47 in some ways absolutely i think less in terms of me and more for others i dont have the same level of enthusiasm but i can inspire others more easily
4016884 there is a prime age like wine aged or seasoned executives establish credibility
4016885 there will be someone a lot better than me long before that
4016886 its an all consuming role i dont know many ceos who are effective more than 15 or 20 years
4016887 some companies use a mandatory retirement age to avoid a potentially awkward conversion and to provide younger leaders with a visible path to higher office
4016888 if the company is objectively managed changes in leadership will happen when appropriate making arbitrary limits unnecessary
4016889 experience is not about having more answers its about asking the right questions
4016890 age does raise questions but i would not write someone off at 70 because of age itself
4016891 i dont think you get smarter but you get wisdom everything is not an existential crisis when you get older you separate out what is really a crisis from an average problem
4016892 the georgia crisis serves as a warning to countries such as ukraine and moldova that they should desist from petitioning for nato entry
4016893 otherwise moscow may intervene to protect the allegedly threatened interests of the russian population
4016894 russia now flush with cash wants to rebuild its 19th century imperial sphere of influence in the former soviet union
4016895 it also wants to make an example out of georgia to other nato aspirants what the chinese call kill the chicken to take care of the monkey so the ukrainians will think russia would use force to prevent them from joining nato

4017051 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4017052 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4017053 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4017054 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4017055 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4017056 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4017057 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4017058 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4017059 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4017060 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4017061 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4017062 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4017063 police booked his ticket from ho chi minh city to london and i have already paid for the ticket on his behalf
4017064 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4017065 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4017069 with our partner national geographic reaching 360 million people every month we have already generated a huge level of interest today i sensed the buzz building around the prize and asked how we can ensure the saltire prize meets our core aims an ambitious transformational and achievable prize which will benefit the world there was a huge amount of enthusiasm expressed and many useful suggestions to steer the way ahead and feed in to the design of the prize

4017088 the proposed price does not reflect the strength of unionbancals strong capital position the superior credit quality of its assets and its potential for profitable asset and core deposit growth in the current market environment
4017089 it improves coordination centralizes responsibility for surveillance and it helps us look at things in a more broad coordinated way
4017090 the point of the agreement is putting it all together and have experienced staff looking at trading across the whole market
4017091 we are increasingly seeing more hedge funds and more cross border trading so it raises the complexity of the investigations
4017092 they should have wiped out the shareholders nationalized the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted as five or 10 individual privately held units
4017093 theres no credible argument for bailing out bear stearns and not the gses
4017094 the law that stipulates that gses are not backed by the full faith and credit of the us government is disbelieved the market believes the government guarantee is there foreigners believe the guarantee is there the only fiscal change is for someone to change the bookkeeping
4017095 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009

4017103 at first when she proposed the rachmaninoff sonata which we have performed several times together i said no way theres something like 59 recordings of it and i told her wed just be one more in the mix but then over time she suggested adding the miaskovsky sonata and then little pieces crept in here and there i figured why not
4017104 but in that amount of time it has been very intense
4017105 irina called me up and asked if i wanted to get together and read through some music
4017106 she knows the entire cello repertoire like the back of her hand we started with beethoven sonatas and kept on going through some really challenging things
4017107 irinas russian and i have my connection to rostropovich so it seems natural
4017108 but its not like he taught me the cello when i came to him i was already formed in my technique and i had my own sound but it didnt have a lot of variety he was so amazing at getting different colors from the cello he added to my range and he always impressed on me to see the bigger picture he pushed me to go beyond what i thought my limits were
4017109 i still have detailed notes from my lessons with him
4017110 there are always going to be two types of perceptions the perceptions that other people have of you and the perceptions you have of yourself i feel like im the same player i was in 1990 i just keep focused on what is important to me

4017136 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4017137 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4017138 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4017139 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee

4017288 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4017289 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4017290 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

4017297 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4017298 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4017299 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4017300 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4017301 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4017302 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4017303 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4017304 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4017305 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4017306 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4017307 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4017322 a couple of our tried and true tenets are broad selection and great prices
4017323 anchored ship in puget sound with last beams of sunlight breaking through clouds just before sunset
4017324 this photographer created a mood filled image by using many different elements to his advantage for example the dark ship is juxtaposed nicely against the red sunset light yet it is also dwarfed by its natural surroundings due to the loose crop he used striated layers of clouds land and sea shroud the man made vessel with a mysterious feeling not present during other times of the day this was a great way to capture more than just a sunset in the sky
4017325 hands down picket pass which lies smack in the middle of the picket range i can think of no other glaciated park in the lower 48 states with such sustained and wild ruggedness
4017326 a place where i can look between my toes and see 1 000 feet straight down thats very exciting
4017327 there are so many beautiful and unspoiled places in the park
4017328 the forest service would have put roads up almost every valley if it wasnt for people like harvey manning
4017329 meant you were pretty much guaranteed to be by yourself
4017330 i turned and saw this can of beer being tossed to me it was from the ranger staffing the lookout there he seemed happy to have company
4017331 now im looking at very young mountains rocks and ice and lots of raw peaks a sea of ruggedness and it was all softened by all the wildflowers that were out i was amazed
4017332 youve got cascading waterfalls far off and nearby peaks and lake ann itself glistening below the pass and its a loop so no doubling back no reruns its all new the whole way
4017333 and here water is cascading all around you its the american alps
4017334 he loved the quick two mile ascent to the pass through the meadow scenery the entire distance
4017335 he always loved the place even as the rules and trail changed to protect the sensitive areas
4017336 i hiked with him up there several times but he would always grumble about the trail after it got relocated
4017337 if i could channel harvey i would hazard a guess that it would be big beaver valley
4017338 even in the 1980s seattle city light wanted to dam and flood that valley since it was not far from ross dam that would have wiped out a magnificent stand of cedars that are maybe 1 000 years old he worked relentlessly to save that area
4017339 compare the look of the british columbia portion of the cascades versus the u s portion
4017340 north of the border the landscape can only be described as moth eaten roads and logging have gone almost everywhere
4017341 once you cross south of the 49th parallel though the landscape below looks virtually untouched with valley after pristine valley without so much as a scratch from logging
4017342 its really quite amazing and an undeniable testament to what was accomplished in 1968
4017343 right now in the us in particular we have a really strong concentration of the industry
4017344 so a lot of people are really concerned about this do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies
4017345 i dont think we do i think we want to have a broader marketplace than that

4017355 the bottom line is that the irs is imposing an additional tax on people paying their taxes
4017356 the current system forces millions of americans to pay a fee for the privilege of filing their taxes even though e filing is cheaper for the irs to process
4017357 there is little reason to believe that an irs operated system would represent an improvement over the products already available in the market and many reasons to believe it would not
4017358 there are no plausible assumptions under which an i file system could produce sufficient savings to pay back its development implementation and operating costs
4017359 continues to offer outstanding online tax preparation software at a competitive price
4017360 there doesnt seem to be any sense or benefit in implementing an i file system
4017361 its core business slowed so it looked for other growth avenues
4017362 thats a sound strategy regardless of how long it is able to offer exclusive access to online tax filing

4017370 if we want to address our economic and terrorism crisis we need political stability in pakistan political stability comes from a reconciliatory approach not a confrontationist approach

4017377 they expressly authorize the fbi to engage in intelligence collection inside the united states
4017378 there was clear eyed and bipartisan recognition after the sept 11 2001 attacks that we needed to be able and allowed to collect intelligence in the united states
4017379 under the new guidelines the investigative steps that the fbi may take in a particular investigation will not be driven by irrelevant factors such as the type of paperwork the agent uses to open the investigation
4017380 im concerned with the way the attorney general frames the problem
4017381 were corrections originally designed to prevent the type of overreach the fbi engaged in for years

4017399 those are not super bowl numbers but for august they are through the roof
4017400 in this fragmented universe for the summer olympics to get a 25 rating is unbelievable
4017401 now youre talking oscars and super bowl the few events left that can gather tens of millions of americans around a television set at the same time
4017402 we know the ratings for tv spike when michael appears
4017403 theres no question hes the dominant story hes a great driver of olympic interest but what were finding is that people might come to see michael phelps but they stay to see lots of other olympic content
4017404 tv is built on the star system and hes the star of these olympics if he had lost a couple of these races it would be a very different story today for our interest in the olympics and nbc right now hes beyond a star hes the most famous person in the world michael phelps of north baltimore
4017405 the combination of the michael phelps and fellow baltimore olympian katie hoff aspect and the intrigue of beijing we knew interest would be really high but this has exceeded expectations
4017406 this has been one of the busiest weeks i think ive ever experienced
4017407 honestly the only olympic games i can remember where a story captured a local markets interest like this was nancy kerrigan in boston back in 1994
4017408 i really believe now its fair to say that this olympics has become a really significant cultural event that the country is sharing
4017409 and honestly you almost never get that in this day of fractionalized audiences and fractionalized media

4017457 im hurting a lot more today thursday for whatever reason
4017458 i got up at 06 00 and went for a wake up swim went through my normal routine and felt good but the race was a lot faster up front
4017459 i was swimming with michael and obviously trying to stay with him in the first 100 it was a bit of a challenge
4017460 i got a bit tired in the second 100 but it was still a good time the second best time ive ever done so im happy
4017461 this is my first big meet where ive swum the 200 individual medley
4017462 normally i swim the 100 free and the relays and the 200 free but this is the first time ive actually stood up next to michael phelps and raced him so its a big learning curve for me
4017463 im going to take all this experience on for the next four years of preparation and hopefully in london we can change it around
4017464 i think i swam the race a bit better than i did last night wednesday but i still think i had the potential to make it through to the final its a bit disappointing but to make semis is quite an achievement
4017465 im not too sure how thats going to go because people are swimming really fast
4017466 it was ricky who helped make history in the house of pain
4017467 personally i think ricky has proved himself as south africas leading scrumhalf is it fouries rugby world cup status that now elevates him above ricky in my view fourie has done nothing to justify a place in the starting line up

4017475 we concurred with the ministers proposition because we found having representatives at all levels to be an organized move towards achieving our goals and aspirations thats why we were swift in implementing it
4017476 this will ease representation because our ideas interests and concerns will be channeled properly up to the ministry it will also step up accountability

4017497 the cockroach stunt has been a big hit with guests at all of our parks including magic mountain but as you know halloween is big business in l a so for magic mountain we made the decision to shake things up a bit and do something different
4017498 what we want people to know is that cockroaches might be given a bad rap in society but they do not deserve to be eaten and used as a gratuitous marketing gimmick
4017499 the cockroach stunt may indeed come back at other parks but if we opt not to include it as part of our fright fest entertainment package it will not be because of peta

4017518 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee

4017566 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
4017567 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
4017568 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
4017569 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
4017570 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
4017571 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
4017572 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
4017573 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional memory become unbound during sleep
4017574 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of

4017616 los mercados han comenzado a preguntarse si el pa s podr a estar al borde de otro default pocos participantes del mercado si es que alguno han olvidado los costos y el drama asociados al default anterior como resultado los mercados est n altamente sensibilizados
4017617 la argentina parece deslizarse r pidamente hacia una posici n desfavorable con costos prohibitivos de financiamiento en momentos en que el fondeo es cada vez m s escaso sin embargo estimamos toda reestructuraci n potencial de la deuda improbable hasta 2010
4017618 las preocupaciones sobre una reestructuraci n de la deuda en el corto plazo parecen exageradas
4017619 mirando hacia adelante la pregunta es ser capaz el gobierno de continuar explotando sus ahorros en 2010 los mercados parecen ser cada vez m s de la opini n de que no
4017620 no vemos la recompra de bonos como un indicio de un cambio fundamental en la pol tica econ mica
4017621 la inflaci n el robusto crecimiento y los altos precios de las commodities
4017622 impacto negativo del retroceso reciente en los precios de las commodities agr colas en las cuentas fiscales y en el desempe o de la econom a real
4017623 es bastante parad jico que un pa s con super vits fiscales gemelos que a n crece a tasas s lidas y cuyas principales exportaciones han tenido un aumento significativo de los precios desde 2003 a n carece de un acceso directo a los mercados y tiene que pagar un 15 para colocar deuda
4017624 ya no es una cuesti n de si los kirchner ser n derrocados sino de cu ndo lo ser n
4017625 dada la intransigencia de los kirchner s lo es una cuesti n de tiempo para que sean echados
4017626 desafortunadamente los cambios abruptos de poder en la argentina tienden a ser ca ticos esa es la raz n por la cual los mercados anticipan un default aun cuando los indicadores macroecon micos del pa s son consistentes
4017627 esta es una pel cula que ya conocimos bien es muy dif cil que un gobierno que pierde la confianza de la sociedad pueda recuperarla
4017628 la situaci n es bastante mala y dado el camino que transitan los kirchner esto terminar mal ya que desde sus tiempos en santa cruz ellos no cambian de rumbo cuando eso puede ser visto como una se al de debilidad

4017695 the united states and the world expect russia to honor that commitment
4017696 i specially checked it with the general staff of the russian armed forces there are no russian servicemen supporting the peacekeeping operation in georgia in poti
4017697 we are not making any secret of that they are staying there to neutralize the large arsenal of weapons and other military hardware in the areas of gori and senaki these arsenals remain unguarded apparently those who guarded them fled
4017698 aimed at ensuring the peace enforcement operation in respect to the georgian side which violates all of its obligations
4017699 with the purpose of demilitarizing the zone adjacent to the conflict area and also guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population russian peacekeepers are evacuating this hardware vehicles and ammunition
4017700 we believe the russians are consolidating their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia and will not significantly expand their ground presence in georgia
4017701 we believe the russians will fall back to their pre crisis boundaries we do expect russia to retain a military presence in both enclaves for the long term
4017702 we do see a halt to offensive military operations if there is a formal cease fire we believe the russians will adhere to it while reserving the right to use military force to respond to threats against their troops
4017703 russian tanks continue to ravage georgia town and villages killing people destroying buildings looting theyve been doing worst things to what ive heard in the past and i could never imagine happening in my country
4017704 the civilian population should be protected against all encroachments on their lives and dignity

4017723 this thing should be protected by some heritage council or something all the gaa crowds the functions people up from the country over the years its just a shame that they are getting rid of it at the same time you would have got a fair amount of posers and dickheads coming in here but you know funnily enough its not so long ago that we were all doin the same thing posing that is
4017724 piss out of a door at the back of the stage
4017725 travelling around the country with six or seven of us piled into the back of a volkswagen van
4017726 we could never have gotten on television there were no childline concerts or anything like that in those years
4017727 there was what they called the herald boot fund which was a charity that gave shoes and boots to children
4017728 they laid on a car which waited for me outside the hotel night and day we met musicians who had no instruments and we gave away bits and pieces we werent using
4017729 paul mcguinness managed it with u2 but that was a bit later and they were exceptions
4017730 ah yeah he was but louis was a punter then we needed someone to do for us what hes done for all those young kids since then if you had a great hit here in those years you knew it wasnt going anywhere so you were stuck
4017731 in the good looking woman days i could have lived anywhere i just never wanted to live away from ireland the flights in those years were a total rip off if you were gone to england for two months it really meant you were gone and youd be playing shows twice a day im a down home irish person and i cant change that its just the way i am
4017732 to give people a laugh or a bit of happiness but i never thought of the sex end of it
4017733 ah now come off it get off the f in stage will ya
4017734 and if you print that youre finished as a journalist
4017735 why does everything have to come back to finding a bit of sh t or a bit of dirt you mentioned girlfriends ive had millions of girlfriends
4017736 im surprised ive no idea why somebody would say something like that about me it could be malicious people saying something like that
4017737 im a private person i always keep my family and friends who are not involved in the business out of the business are people not allowed to have a life without people shoutin about it or selling newspapers over what someone said to you
4017738 if i had gotten into this business for money and if i was concerned about that i would have had to have gotten out years ago
4017739 i have to be thinking about what im going to be in the studio or on the stage there was always enough of everything so i never really bothered about the financial end of things
4017740 i was in the pod for ronan keatings 21st birthday party a i did it to give people a laugh or a bit of happiness but i never thought of the sex end of it he shakes his head jaysus few years ago and all sorts of people were coming up to me darren smith who was with record company emi at the time was there and he was amazed to see all these people talking to me and he got on to me and we came up with the idea for joes 90s suddenly we had younger people coming to the shows and hearing the old stuff and the older people were introduced to these new songs
4017741 trust me buddy it wasnt the money you know no matter what i say the motivation is going to sound hokey a little holier than thou even but i did it for the love of the exploration
4017742 i was as exhausted as a motherf ker i got one day off after filming nine months of svu luddites note it stands for special victims unit but you just dont turn your back on arthur miller and an opportunity like this its going to be painful a huge challenge for me
4017743 i was working part time as a bouncer performing in these stupid f kin plays with eight people on the stage and four people in the audience i went hungry sometimes it wasnt a whole lot of fun
4017744 some of it was totally cheesy i did this commercial in germany for a washing machine repair guy when the housewife takes the clothes out of the machine she goes aii schmutzraender oh no stains and i look at her and repeat aii schmutzraender i went around hamburg trying to pick up chicks with this one lame phrase needless to say i never got laid in hamburg
4017745 it was the whole tom of finland fantasy for gay men
4017746 but girls guys whatever its just nice that people are watching
4017747 oz got me the gay guys and the fat girls keller married a well built lady in the series and then on law and order i got the other girls
4017748 we couldnt have kids the normal way we both knew from day one that these were the steps we were going to take we just didnt know with whom
4017749 we went online to surrogacy agencies we interviewed lots of people and i have to say with all due respect some of them were freaks i was very leery of the process the whole way through
4017750 there was a friend of ours who worked with a girl who had said she would consider being a surrogate we met her and right away she was awesome we were looking for someone who could take care of themselves and it was pretty clear she could
4017751 it still took over a year after we met her because we failed to conceive on a couple of attempts she hung in there for us i was in the hospital for the births and it was the most amazing experience having kids has shown me that there is something more important in life than acting
4017752 my first thought when i came here was that i understood why there are so many great irish writers because there is something mystical in the air theres always this cloudy moody sky and its challenging i used to live in la and it was the opposite of that always so sunny so saccharine so bland
4017753 so they knew that if i was going to steal id be stealing from my own kind
4017754 im third generation italian but i still have a strong sense of my heritage there are certain italianisms that ring very true in this play the place of the man in the household the idea of respect of omerta
4017755 in my parents house it was more or less the same it was the womans job to take care of the kids in my house forget it its totally different we eat out a few times a day
4017756 this is dublin not london goddammit im a step ahead of em all no seriously i had great faith in irish actors that theyd be hip to the whole theatre thing and they are i had no illusions of coming over here as some kind of big shot its been a learning experience for me too
4017757 are you happy with your life and moving in the right direction because thats the main thing
4017758 why couldnt we have been all civil and pleasant and self helpy when we were wearing navy uniforms

4017762 female and slightly nuts but in a sweet commercially viable way
4017763 as a woman and as a singer songwriter thats the only way i could get them to accept me but i think that view of me has been changing for some people since i did strange little girls her 2001 albumin which she performed covers of songs written by male songwriters
4017764 especially the eminem cover 97 bonnie and clyde tells the story a man dumping the body of his dead wife considered by some people to be the most misogynistic song in eminems catalogue the ones who thought they had locked their doors at night the ones who were dancing in that womans blood i smelled their asses out
4017765 the beekeeper is about the creative mothers whose stories have been suppressed im talking about people like mary magdalene women whose stories were played down or in some cases completely written out of the bible im a daughter of the christian church her father is a methodist minister and i want to attack this false christianity and the fake methodology that lead to it
4017766 well i suppose on my earlier albums i was looking inward
4017767 the flame haired songstress was one of the few artists not to cancel tours after america invaded iraq and on the album she deals with her experiences of that tour
4017768 this war has been hugely divisive ive known couples who have separated over it

4017775 i hoped every day for months i left the light on in the hall downstairs and in the bed at night i used to listen to see if he would come in the door you would be hoping the phone would ring and that would be him
4017776 unser busfahrer h tte losfahren k nnen aber er weigerte sich er hatte angst also stieg ein ersatzfahrer ein und dann pl tzlich standen r sner und degowski im bus mit waffen in der hand und ihren beiden geiseln aus der bank in gladbeck
4017777 in dieser situation hatte ich noch keine angst der kopf war ausgeschaltet ich funktionierte einfach
4017778 als silke danach wieder in den bus kam war sie sichtlich fertig und ganz still ich hielt ihre hand
4017779 er sa direkt vor mir degowski schoss glaube ich in die menge und ich kniff die augen zu ich sp rte einen windhauch dachte schon selbst getroffen zu sein dann merkte ich emanuele war getroffen alle schrien der muss raus ich bin dann aufgestanden habe gefragt ob mir jemand helfen kann aber niemand half ich trug ihn bis zur t r er blutete ich hatte furchtbare angst ihm weh zu tun an der bust r nahmen zwei journalisten ihn mir ab

4017785 robust infrastructure demand the rand dollar depreciation and rising copper prices were the key revenue drivers in the first half of 2008 and required additional working capital we are proud to have been able to produce solid results despite tough market conditions including inflationary cost push pressures high interest rates and also skills and electricity shortages

4017803 obviously there is a scheme behind the scenes to encircle china a new cold war
4017804 we will stand up and hold together always as one family in harmony
4017805 to make the thoroughly biased french media and public feel losses and pain
4017806 domestic and foreign hostile forces have made the beijing olympics a focus for infiltration and sabotage
4017807 people who fart through the mouth will get shit stuffed down their throats by me
4017808 someone give me a gun dont show mercy to the enemy
4017809 like a mothball which goes from solid to gas directly
4017810 there will be no more room for nationalism than there is for smallpox
4017811 it appears i have expressed a common feeling a shared view
4017812 china was backward throughout its modern history so we were always seeking the reasons for why the west grew strong
4017813 we learned from the west all of us who are educated have this dream grow strong by learning from the west
4017814 weve been studying western history for so long we understand it well
4017815 we think our love for china our support for the government and the benefits of this country is not a spontaneous reaction it has developed after giving the matter much thought
4017816 because we are in such a system we are always asking ourselves whether we are brainwashed
4017817 we are always eager to get other information from different channels
4017818 but when you are in a so called free system you never think about whether you are brainwashed
4017819 the same bunch of goons and thugs theyve been for the last fifty years
4017820 i can tell you everything about all those movies like star wars
4017821 he wasnt like other kids who spent their pocket money on food he saved all his money to buy books
4017822 if he had questions that he couldnt figure out then he couldnt sleep
4017823 for us if we didnt get it we just gave up
4017824 it was famous we were proud of this at last we had a highway
4017825 problems with human rights property right disputes the threat posed to taiwan
4017826 but we chinese can use it to tell the people of the world that china cannot be insulted
4017827 up to now the chinese government has been able to keep a grip on it
4017828 but i call it the virtual tiananmen square they dont need to go there they can do the same thing online and sometimes be even more damaging
4017829 chinese tradition has many good things but weve ditched them
4017830 i feel there have to be people to carry them on
4017831 most of my generation has a smooth happy life including me
4017832 i feel like our character lacks something for example love for the country or the perseverance you get from conquering hardships those virtues i dont see them in myself and many people my age
4017833 for him from that kind of background with nobody educated in his family nobody helping him with schoolwork with great family pressure its not easy to get where he is today
4017834 leo strauss and the world of intelligence by which we do not mean nous
4017835 during the nineteen eighties and nineties most intellectuals had a negative opinion of chinas traditional culture
4017836 to assess a countrys true strength and prosperity you cant simply look at gnp growth and not look at the inner experience of each ordinary person does he feel safe is he happy
4017837 i sensed that this kid is very smart and diligent
4017838 now we started reading ancient chinese books and we rediscovered the ancient china
4017839 we opened our market but when we try to buy your companies we hit political obstacles its not fair
4017840 no matter who is elected china is still china and will go the way it goes
4017841 who can stand in the way of the march of history
4017842 we used to think they were just a postmodern occidentalized generation
4017843 of course i thought the students i knew were very good but the wider generation i was not very pleased to see the content of tang jies video and the scale of its popularity among the youth made me very happy very happy
4017844 how can our national self respect be so fragile and shallow
4017845 somebody says youre a mob so you curse him even want to beat him and then you say were not a mob this is as if someone said you were a fool so you held up a big sign in front of his girlfriends brothers dog saying i am not a fool the message will get to him but hell still think youre a fool
4017846 however the current young generation turns a blind eye to it ive never seen them respond to those major domestic issues rather they take a utilitarian opportunistic approach
4017847 we accept all the values of human rights of democracy
4017848 we accept that the issue is how to realize it
4017849 june 4th could not and should not succeed at that time if june 4th had succeeded china would be worse and worse not better
4017850 in the nineteen nineties i thought that the chinese government is not good enough maybe we need to set up a better government
4017851 the problem is that we didnt know what a good government would be so we let the chinese communist party stay in place the other problem is we didnt have the power to get them out they have the army
4017852 we really acknowledge him we really think he was brave
4017853 they fought for china to make the country better and there were some faults of the government but finally we must admit that the chinese government had to use any way it could to put down that event
4017854 you eat bread you drink coffee all of these are not brought by democracy indian guys have democracy and some african countries have democracy but they cant feed their own people
4017855 chinese people have begun to think one part is the good life another part is democracy
4017856 if democracy can really give you the good life thats good but without democracy if we can still have the good life why should we choose democracy
4017857 at duke university grace wang a chinese freshman tried to mediate between pro tibet and pro china protesters on campus
4017858 i really dont know where she is and i think its better for me not to know
4017859 when people cant express themselves in real life what can they do they definitely have to express their anger toward someone im far away they dont know me so they dont feel sorry about it they say whatever they want
4017860 this is just like what happened in the cultural revolution
4017861 think about how deng xiaoping was treated at that time and then in just ten years things had changed completely
4017862 the accumulated desire for expression just like when a flood suddenly races into a breach
4017863 are acutely aware that their country whose resurgence they feel and admire has no principle to guide it
4017864 some of them see that liberalism in the west has lost its belief in itself and they turn to leo strauss for conservatism that is based on principle on natural right this conservatism is distinct from a status quo conservatism because they are not satisfied with a country that has only a status quo and not a principle
4017865 look at the people everyone thinks this is their own olympics
4017866 when i stand here i can feel deeply the common emotion of chinese youth
4017867 adding manpower to a late software project makes it later
4017868 i need authority to get this project back on track we may take a little longer but you will get something that meets your needs
4017869 you really dont know i could be very good at what i do and i could be guiding you to the best possible solution to your problem equally i could be a bloody good talker and know bugger all like the last people that you trusted and who put you where you are now and to be totally honest you have no way of knowing which of those two is the truth
4017870 the best way you can judge whether i am leading you down the right path or not is by results by this friday you will have a full walking skeleton of the site with all legacy data largely imported and viewable you can then see the site as it evolves you can see the story cards move across the board as we complete them and if at any point you feel we are not making the progress we should be we can discuss it and deal with it
4017871 we were anticipating a slowdown and had started planning for it more than 18 months ago

4017881 es ist schon sehr beachtlich wie er den spagat zwischen diesen so unterschiedlichen rennserien hinbekommt der porsche ist ein schweres auto das du rund fahren musst der formel master bolide ist leicht und exakt du musst v llig unterschiedlich an die sache herangehen
4017882 damit wird der formel master immens geholfen denn sie stand ja schon seit jeher in direkter konkurrenz zur formel 3 euroserie als gp3 im rahmen der formel 1 hat sie nat rlich sofort einen h heren status
4017883 wir alle wollen ja die besten und nicht die reichsten piloten in der k nigsklasse sehen
4017884 die formel master hat nicht nur ein sehr gutes medienkonzept sie ist auch sehr darauf erpicht die kosten f r die jungen piloten zu senken das ist gerade heute willkommen wo die schere zwischen arm und reich immer gr er wird
4017885 der motorsport ist ja auch ein spiegel unserer gesellschaft und es ist f r einen piloten ohne finanziellen background heute nur noch schwer m glich sein talent in die auslage zu stellen wenn sich diese entwicklung fortsetzen w rde w re das letztlich auch f r die formel 1 sch dlich denn wir alle wollen ja die besten und nicht die reichsten piloten in der k nigsklasse sehen
4017886 auch diese summe muss man erst einmal aufstellen der motorsport ist heute sehr kostspielig die gp2 kostet 1 5 bis 2 millionen euro pro saison da kann man es nur begr en wenn der gp2 mit der gp3 eine rennserie vorgelegt wird die speziell auf kosteneinschr nkung bedacht ist und dieser spargedanke geht auch nicht auf kosten der qualit t das formel master auto ist nach anf nglichen kinderkrankheiten heute ein sehr gutes rennauto das sehr konkurrenzf hig ist
4017887 man wird wohl damit rechnen m ssen dass die kosten f r eine saison um etwa 20 bis 30 prozent ansteigen werden andererseits hast du im rahmenprogramm der formel 1 durchaus mehr m glichkeiten was die sponsorenarbeit anbelangt
4017888 allein ein gutes rennauto kostet heute runde 100 000 euro und da sind noch keinerlei weiteren kosten abgedeckt
4017889 der sport muss unbedingt wieder kosteng nstiger werden die talente m ssen sich durchsetzen wenn du dir die heutige formel 1 ansiehst fr her waren die autos nur sehr schwer zu fahren dass ein rookie wie lewis hamilton gleich vom ersten rennen an vorne mitf hrt hat es fr her nicht gegeben
4017890 ich bin nat rlich kein techniker aber die autos waren fr her alle bermotorisiert sie waren instabil und nur schwer zu beherrschen heute sind sie eher untermotorisiert und du kannst damit wie mit einer eisenbahn durch die kurven fahren wenn man die aerodynamik weiter reduzieren und man zugleich die motoren st rker auslegen w rde w re es wieder schwieriger ein solches auto zu pilotieren der starke motor w re kein sicherheitsrisiko dann m sste man eben fr her auf die bremse steigen am ende w rde das fahren auch wieder mehr freude bereiten und das wiederum w rde zu mehr spektakel f hren und damit die fans erfreuen

4017895 sections 8007 8084 and 9005 of the act prohibit the use of funds to initiate a special access program or a new start program unless the congressional defense committees receive advance notice the supreme court of the united states has stated that the presidents authority to classify and control access to information bearing on the national security flows from the constitution and does not depend upon a legislative grant of authority although the advance notice contemplated by sections 8007 8084 and 9005 can be provided in most situations as a matter of comity situations may arise especially in wartime in which the president must act promptly under his constitutional grants of executive power and authority as commander in chief of the armed forces while protecting certain extraordinarily sensitive national security information the executive branch shall construe these sections in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the president
4017896 none of the funds provided in this title may be used to finance programs or activities denied by congress in fiscal years 2006 or 2007 appropriations to the department of defense or to initiate a procurement or research development test and evaluation new start program without prior written notification to the congressional defense committees

4017903 mormon belief that homosexual behavior in a monogamous relationship is worthy of condemnation has no rational or empirical basis
4017904 at many schools theyve been arrested for going on campus
4017905 we also feel that true eternal happiness and spiritual progression can only come through having good family relationships since it is impossible for a homosexual couple to have children we teach that those with homosexual tendencies should learn to control them there is more to this life than sex sex in and of itself will not bring happiness just animalistic pleasure in an eternal perspective having that family is totally worth any sacrifice necessary
4017906 does that mean that heterosexual behavior or advocacy of heterosexual behavior are inappropriate and violate the honor code as well

4017915 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
4017916 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
4017917 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
4017918 i feel for sure ive made 100 per cent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
4017919 this has always been a very important contract for me ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract to see my playing days out at chelsea
4017920 i am delighted that frank has committed his future to the club

4017925 you dont get many chances and you have to take them we didnt do that we lost concentration on two occasions and got punished
4017926 it was very difficult to play against that team they were very passionate but in the second half we worked hard because we want to qualify for the champions league it is a big competition for us

4017934 this particular theater employs a person with disabilities its not about the theater its about the movie
4017935 it is so rude to show it in the theaters
4017936 no matter the intention it is unacceptable and extremely hurtful for a majority group to freely make jokes about a minority group reinforcing the prejudice and discrimination that people with developmental disabilities have been fighting for generations
4017937 its downright mean and dehumanizing its horrific they dont deserve to be treated that way
4017938 people with cognitive and developmental disabilities are our family members our friends our neighbors and our co workers
4017939 they do not deserve to be ridiculed to get a laugh in a movie
4017940 if i saw that depiction i would leave the movie
4017941 these allegations of election fraud are paranoid fantasies the republicans and their friends in the voting machine industry wouldnt dare fix a national election such a conspiracy would be too massive to keep secret and once it came to light it would destroy the gop

4017947 those are not super bowl numbers but for august they are through the roof
4017948 in this fragmented universe for the summer olympics to get a 25 rating is unbelievable
4017949 now youre talking oscars and super bowl the few events left that can gather tens of millions of americans around a television set at the same time
4017950 we know the ratings for tv spike when michael appears
4017951 theres no question hes the dominant story hes a great driver of olympic interest but what were finding is that people might come to see michael phelps but they stay to see lots of other olympic content
4017952 tv is built on the star system and hes the star of these olympics if he had lost a couple of these races it would be a very different story today for our interest in the olympics and nbc right now hes beyond a star hes the most famous person in the world michael phelps of north baltimore
4017953 the combination of the michael phelps and fellow baltimore olympian katie hoff aspect and the intrigue of beijing we knew interest would be really high but this has exceeded expectations
4017954 this has been one of the busiest weeks i think ive ever experienced
4017955 honestly the only olympic games i can remember where a story captured a local markets interest like this was nancy kerrigan in boston back in 1994
4017956 i really believe now its fair to say that this olympics has become a really significant cultural event that the country is sharing
4017957 and honestly you almost never get that in this day of fractionalized audiences and fractionalized media
4017958 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4017959 i think its something thats getting more and more prevalent
4017960 i think were getting to the point where the word retard or retarded is used to describe anything undesirable or anything stupid
4017961 sometimes i think the word has almost lost its meaning
4017962 i hear a lot of teenagers using the word now like they dont know at all what it means
4017963 the great disappointment from our point of view is that the movie made it this far without this issue even coming up
4017964 were not making a play for pity were not making a play to be the language police but as long as you perpetuate that stereotype it has a very damaging effect on people with intellectual disabilities
4017965 i hear the word retarded its basically like putting people down
4017966 ive felt that way when i was called retarded i just wasnt motivated it hurts my feelings very deeply
4017967 yeah brett favre sucks hes never gonna win a super bowl lol
4017968 i have been a warriors fan since age 3 and attended every home playoff game this year at different locations warrior fans in the first round were worthy of the praise bestowed upon them by the media you included last night i was disgusted to be at the oracle the dallas series was packed with real fans a raucous arena full of people who had really been waiting 15 years once we upset the mavericks though we became obscenely trendy now rich suburban families who couldnt name half our roster decided it would be fun to take the family to a game and prices went up to 250 a seat for the lower bowl goodbye real fans hello normal nba crowd the arena was subpar in the game 3 win but was absolutely silent in game 4 i got in fights with fans around me after screaming at them to make noise its a sad day for bay area basketball the fans get credit for the wins we deserve the blame for this loss
4017969 wow fleury makes you forget all about how crappy jean sebastian aubin was right
4017970 scoring four goals was important it was a european return the lads cared about it they played a good match
4017971 we want to stay in our building its very much our home
4017972 the idea of coming to work every day under a microsoft sign is not so appealing to us
4017973 microsoft has a valid lease at the building that was negotiated in good faith
4017974 microsoft is committed to its partners and employees in massachusetts and looks forward to expanding its strong r amp d presence in cambridge

4017978 we want to know who dumped flame and make sure they dont have any other pets if this is how they abuse and neglect them
4017979 dumping pets at our shelter is illegal because we are not contracted by the town any and all pets taken in by us must meet approval so we can ensure we have the space and funding to properly care for them this cat was very fortunate that she wasnt found by a cruel person who could have tormented and abused her further
4017980 she is in very poor condition and anybody that knows who did this needs to step up to the plate
4017981 what stood out was that even in these conditions these people still had hope
4017982 serving the community has always been a hallmark of the school
4017983 what better way to anticipate the 50th than to take some of what we have been given and give it back

4018017 it was clear that a settlement strategy was the right strategy

4018019 many people with brain injuries can keep making gains for years with the right help
4018020 for people with brain injuries statewide the settlement will mean they can live independently in their own community close to family and friends

4018025 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
4018026 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4018027 we were unhappy with the initial actions of the american officials but this one was very strong
4018028 we wont be protecting the airport or seaport but well certainly protect our assets if we need to
4018029 to continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia

4018062 ive jettisoned the trinity the virgin birth and the incarnation
4018063 everything im saying has a question mark at the end
4018064 freud is not an atheist today and besides all truth is gods truth we should be grateful for it
4018065 there are many people within the fold who have not really grasped the heart of the christian message because they are bogged down by too many doctrines customs symbols and other traditions with no sense of differentiation between the relative essentiality and nonessentiality of the respective items for such christians the faith has an air of unreality and they have become rather numb to the whole thing
4018066 but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the ex cellency of the power may be of god and not of us
4018067 if they only knew what i had in my briefcase
4018068 it would be blasphemous for it would be another idolatry
4018069 god is not a passive god he is like steam under a lid and a person is the lid
4018070 god is there all right hes not wishful thinking but wevegeot to get open to him god is a moving dynamic reality not a passive one sometimes he gets through in spite of our notions
4018071 that is why i reject the special providence for israel in the old testament that they were supposed to knock the canaanites out of israel like we knocked the mexicans out of california
4018072 god creates and breaks through us and preeminently in jesus christ ive abandoned ship on the trinity because all we affirm in three persons is going on all the time and we can say this is god
4018073 whatever one can affirm of the trinity one can affirm of god the things we say of the holy ghost in our creed the old testament says thus spake the lord god one doesnt want to lose sight of the prophetic in speaking of the lord god
4018074 the moslems offer one god and three wives we offer three gods and one wife no wonder christianity is losing in africa
4018075 is not even that traditional for adoptionism presupposes a special act of god ive rejected that god does special things jesus freely adopted the messianic role god was able to flow through because jesus was more open
4018076 jesus is still unique because god who breaks through him is unique and jesus is the standard by which all others are measured
4018077 the phenomenon is real though you cant confirm the apparition is out there st paul experienced a vision too it was a reality but you cant affirm that christ was there you know only that the experience was there
4018078 im sorry my theological education was such that at 52 i should be a novice
4018079 the infinite and inexhaustible depth and ground of all being
4018080 freeing the word of god from a bygone world view
4018081 man has learned to cope with all questions of importance without recourse to god as a working hypothesis as in the scientific field so in human affairs generally what we call god is being more and more edged out of life losing more and more ground
4018082 a sophisticated version of the old man in the sky
4018083 was god for a limited period taking part in a charade god dressed up like father christmas
4018084 were moving in the same direction but from different points
4018085 i am asking what do we really mean by what we say when we use a word like god what realities are we talking about i feel we dont know what we mean we are being compelled to an agonizing reappraisal my concern is to ask what is most real to us in our experience what is the ground of our relationships it is much more about the fundamental reality of these words than the images and language we use to define them that my questions have arisen
4018086 the old theology starts with the divinity of christ and tries to explain how god became man the new theology starts with the only indisputable fact that christ was man and tries to show how god acted through him uniquely
4018087 the new theology implies a rejection of any picture of god as father with no clear picture of god replacing the old god as encountered is the god inside people in christian terms this amounts to the abandonment of teaching about god the father a reemphasis of teaching about god as holy spirit and a great uncertainty about the identity of jesus
4018088 that if we reform the church we do away with the external beauty tradition should be de absolutized but not scrapped were in a two thousand year continuity and that which expresses continuity is invaluable in a state of flux on doctrine continuity of tradition has even more value
4018089 take the virgin birth i should have thought the purpose of this was to ask who was this man jesus the new testament writers tried to cite what was for them the significance of this event and they expressed this as a miraculous intervention of a supernatural power into the course of history the literal detail of something like the virgin birth is secondary you have to ask what were the writers trying to say i fully subscribe to what they were trying to say
4018090 the clergy have little idea how lightly the laity sit with orthodoxy
4018091 the inside of the edge of the church and the outside of the edge
4018092 i dont think god is very interested in church attendance the churchs business isnt to tuck god into bed once a week the trouble with the church is it has made god small
4018093 the structure of the church as a religious club will inevitably find itself being squeezed out
4018094 i welcome this it is in fact a liberation it will be a great release of power and energy not many people today are interested in a religious club im more concerned that the church be there as a witness of love and service at the points of real need and be agents of reconciliation doing the work of the servant church in the world
4018095 a lot of them were never interested in the trinity until i got involved in civil rights
4018096 once youve gone through you ask if something is true at all you come full circle and find yourself talking and acting like the person who didnt have these beliefs in the first place im not abandoning anything until im sure
4018097 this kind of thinking has enabled quite a few people to stay in the ministry
4018098 you can get out of the church but you lose the chance to work creatively from within
4018099 we are in a period where new structures and the forms they will take are by no means clear
4018100 one has to be open to the spirit and respond without any knowledge where it will lead and whether it will provide a new pattern if one knew the answers the search would be bogus if one follows the truth one must trust it
4018101 not the finality but that which lies beyond it will be
4018102 we will have seen through a glass darkly we will have reached out and touched the face of the almighty
4018103 its wonderful but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot
4018104 britney has huge legal bills to pay the money has been going one way out of her bank account for a long time and this is a way to bring something in
4018105 i see him all the time at least once a week we still have feelings for each other i still love him and i think he loves me
4018106 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
4018107 i stay away from the tabloids im not going to talk about lindsay because shes my friend you know shes great
4018108 with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up
4018109 bernies not the guy thats going to take the day off because hes sick
4018110 i went to see him in the hospital and even when he was in the hospital he was still bernie and he came back to work and he was on oxygen and actually came to work and between takes was on oxygen and he would take the oxygen mask off and do a take and then put the oxygen back on because he couldnt get enough oxygen into his lungs
4018111 i have never texted or emailed senator obama and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise
4018112 in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone
4018113 i would hope that my friend obamas republican rival john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics
4018114 women kind of wilt as men achieve as they get older like wine
4018115 its just a preconceived notion about women in general and particularly in this industry its a very very vain industry
4018116 theres been a bit of tension for some time they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
4018117 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
4018118 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
4018119 he was at the draft with us the first couple of years alex was with the 49ers anywhere alex would go david would go with him the super bowl everything
4018120 i asked him if he wanted to come up for saturdays game he was going to come up
4018121 shes one of the most red blooded americans i know a great person and great role model
4018122 in womens basketball the olympics is the highest thing anybody can achieve becky has worked very very hard in her career why not play for russia it doesnt mean shes not american
4018123 my career has been about taking hold of opportunities and learning with them ive had a lot of people pass on me i wasnt drafted i wasnt heavily recruited i didnt go to a big college so im used to people telling me no but there are always other ways so im very grateful to the russian team to accept me as one of their own
4018124 theres a lot of emotion over the russia u s dynamic
4018125 if i played for a small country that nobody had ever heard of it would be different
4018126 i could either have gone home and sat on the couch and watched the olympics on tv or come here and taken part
4018127 and for me i love playing basketball and i love my teammates and this is a great opportunity to encourage them and make friendships with people all around the world thats what the whole sporting thing is about isnt it
4018128 we have a lot of support and a following in stockton
4018129 what does the level of play in this league so disgust you that you call it grassroots who told you it was grassroots
4018130 oh you mean nick peters yeah yeah what do you need man
4018131 watching jeffrey with the way he was as a player you knew hed coach with an emphasis on technique
4018132 because he was such a physical and intimidating presence you forget when you play guys have to think during a game it doesnt surprise me as much as it might the average fan
4018133 i love coach kiffins hard ace approach to this team we need to get that nastiness back on defense
4018134 because of the suspicious nature of the death and the unidentified substance it leads to a lot of questions
4018135 having the bible in one hand and a bread in the other hand is not a correct thing kill them kill them kill them that is my massage

4018140 we do have credible reports that russia has taken actions that violate the cease fire agreement and thats what the president was referring to
4018141 i cant get into specifics but we do have those reports and were concerned about them and we are working to get concrete information its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
4018142 it is very difficult to get accurate in real time in a crisis that is fast moving
4018143 this is a motorized conflict in a relatively small area and that means the situation on the ground can change very quickly
4018144 i think this is a significant lack of policy and analysis
4018145 i think the administration has most of what they need
4018146 im sure we have a lot more information than theyre discussing publicly

4018151 i was just trying to make pitches when i needed to
4018152 but he doesnt allow big innings to happen he had bases loaded no outs and he found a way out of it
4018153 when hes out there we feel like we dont have to score a lot because hes not going to give up a lot when hes out there theres a good chance well win
4018154 hes one of the best pitchers in the big leagues
4018155 i was just trying to bear down and make pitches
4018156 i was just trying to get us out of the inning
4018157 that was pretty high they didnt know my knee hurt
4018158 you get excited when you can win like that thats just a thrill theyre all at home plate
4018159 if this doesnt help our confidence i dont know what will
4018160 ive got to hand it to our bullpen they came in and did a tremendous job
4018161 hes an asset to any lineup hes definitely an asset to ours
4018162 i said when we got him we cant leave it all on his shoulders
4018163 i pitched myself into that and i didnt pitch my way out of it
4018164 they shut our offense down and they kept coming at us and we couldnt hold them
4018165 theyve got some good hitters man jeff kent ive seen him for a long time hes a good hitter

4018188 miss thompson is a lady who has suffered some great personal tragedy recently
4018189 she sadly lost her brother in one of the recent knife crime epidemic incidents its a sad matter for her and something which is affecting her at the moment
4018190 she saw owen was in trouble under the water and couldnt come up
4018191 afterwards when the incident was reported they fobbed her the friends mum off with two tennis vouchers
4018192 the manager said to him you werent supposed to see that
4018193 my concern is that they are supposed to be trained to watch out for children getting into trouble in the water and they are not doing their jobs
4018194 the lifeguards reacted to this incident immediately and followed the correct course of action
4018195 our duty manager stayed with the child and his guardian and provided the necessary health and safety advice and followed the necessary course of action
4018196 there were no other incidents at the centre that day
4018197 we support kice staff because we believe that the outcome of these negotiations will impact very significantly on every student and family within the community on kangaroo island
4018198 this is likely to significantly disadvantage country and smaller schools such as kice on kangaroo island through the application of this strategy and proposed budget cuts
4018199 under this proposal there will be no allocation of funds to employ support staff to assist teaching programs and provide support for students with special needs and it also removes the allocation of teacher preparation time

4018203 we were on the see saw and he came over and said are you looking at me and i said no and he said stop looking at me and i said we can if we want and then he said if you dont stop looking at me i will stab you and he had a knife that he held pointing towards us
4018204 when they came over and said he had a knife i didnt know what to do i didnt know whether to confront the defendant but instead i decided to take the children home and call the police
4018205 i never had the knife out of the pouch they were laughing at a boy i was with for falling off the roundabout and he went up to them but i told him to leave it and they walked off

4018215 empty condom packet amp a photo of the tarts knickers
4018216 the next item that will probably be sold on ebay at a start price of 99c and of course with no reserve
4018217 we let her know about the policy and instead shes now selling a photograph of the offending knickers
4018218 ebay does connect colourful buyers with colourful sellers and i wouldnt be surprised if someone did buy these items though i couldnt speculate on who would buy them or why
4018219 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage
4018220 senior people in john holland were on site today to assure them that they remain part of the process
4018221 sams family is jewish lindsay has learned a lot about judaism from sam and admires its beliefs
4018222 two years ago it was kabbalah last year it was alcoholics anonymous she was into peace for a while whatever is of the moment thats lindsay
4018223 but the one thing it does show is her commitment to sam she could be any religion and lindsay would be open to it
4018224 lindsay is great but shes also 22 years old i think people forget that
4018225 with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up
4018226 even the airport security guy in canada asked me so is it true
4018227 id love them unconditionally if they wanted to id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
4018228 shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling
4018229 god has a way of taking something bad and turning it into something good

4018232 the former friends star has been unable to find love since her divorce four years ago from brad pitt
4018233 i see him all the time at least once a week
4018234 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years
4018235 they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
4018236 i really didnt know about blackface and minstrels and all that so i had to read about that whole history
4018237 i have to admit he was pretty good at it
4018238 he stayed in character on the set and i had to keep my mom away from him she thought he was don cheadle
4018239 while the hotels clientele is an obvious part of this world im more interested in the downstairs part of upstairs downstairs
4018240 im not his muse every single junket that weve done so far we always get the muse thing and we always say no its not that way
4018241 woody and i both appreciate how wonderful it is to work with your friends and its fun and we always have a great time when we do it we entertain each other we understand each other and we poke each other
4018242 she was only 19 years old at the time but i was in a hole i had to get somebody quickly and i knew that scarlett was a great actress and a beauty
4018243 i dont think i am beautiful i can look good and i can look ugly
4018244 whats funny is that when i was younger i wanted everyone to look at me now i like to watch other people because you can learn a lot of interesting things
4018245 my family my brother my sister theyre always complaining that im too protective and ive always been like that
4018246 at the age of 7 months babies will watch a fearful face for longer than a happy face and their attentiveness level as measured by eeg is higher after seeing a fearful than a happy face
4018247 by contrast infants aged 5 months watch both faces when they are shown side by side for just as long and there is no difference in the intensity of attention in favour of the fearful face
4018248 these low cost amplifying devices can look tempting to individuals with hearing impairment because of the significant cost differences but our research found that the low cost aids generally dont meet the fitting requirements to help a hearing impaired person and could potentially damage a persons hearing
4018249 aside from being of extremely poor quality very low cost hearing aids those under 100 dollars have the potential to damage your hearing because they send very loud sounds into the ear the studys mid range hearing aids 100 to 500 dollars were of higher quality and were not considered a safety hazard
4018250 based on the research the best advice for consumers is to talk to an audiologist because hearing aids have complex technical features they need to be fitted and customized to the individual
4018251 currently more than 32 million people have a hearing impairment yet only about 25 percent of those use hearing aids meanwhile the aging population is growing and hearing loss becomes more common as we become older
4018252 whats fascinating here is that we see that nature is able to produce events that can manifest themselves at several locations
4018253 we see it over the whole park not just a single trail
4018254 its hard to make generalisations it can depend heavily on species as some are more affected by recreation than others
4018255 were not in any way advocating that people stop seeing nature but were trying to heighten the awareness of site managers to these unexpected impacts on wildlife
4018256 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
4018257 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
4018258 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
4018259 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
4018260 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
4018261 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
4018262 yeah there were discussions about me going elsewhere before i came here and all that i am happy to be here i really am its a lot different from what im used to did i ever think it would end up this way umm no but its not over yet and im excited
4018263 i think you can ask the receivers he still has it
4018264 but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
4018265 i said look i heard youre not talking to the media
4018266 he said its not that its not that i obviously was joking on that i said look im not here to take chads spot or replace him or whatever it is what it is
4018267 i said this the other day i dont think ive ever beaten chad
4018268 visita fiscale obbligatoria anche per un solo giorno di malattia
4018269 we were looking for a physical fullback hes 6 foot 235 now in college football generally there is no fullback anymore we were looking for a guy with athleticism who would go out there and bang heads
4018270 he really showed up on film and special teams as a guy with speed who wasnt afraid to hit people the beauty of the practice squad is it gives you a chance to see people who otherwise would be out of the league
4018271 they thought i had the body type to translate to fullback
4018272 i talked it over with my agent things hadnt been going as well as id liked in washington i just saw it as a great opportunity a chance to start over
4018273 it took a long time to get comfortable at fullback especially with all the shifts and motions that offensive coordinator norv turner had
4018274 hitting somebody from the other side of the ball was a harder transition than i thought
4018275 he definitely has a chance to make the roster because hes one of our core guys on special teams
4018276 hes got instincts from playing both sides of the ball
4018277 hes a four way starter both punt teams and both kickoff teams moran is a different body type 6 1 250 hes more of a guard he can do the kickoff return team well and he can do field goals but hes a backup coverage type body hes not as versatile as zak is because zak has more speed and more athletic ability
4018278 he has a standard of work ethic and toughness that was unsurpassed
4018279 he was a sideline to sideline player at linebacker but we also played him at tight end fullback and tailback he knew how to use leverage he understood the game
4018280 a safety came up to hit him and landed 5 yards deep in the end zone zak just trucked him we knew then that he was a special player
4018281 he twice led the conference in tackles every team had to game plan for him
4018282 until i hear anything else thats the way im looking at it right now
4018283 im focusing on football until i hear anything else ill assume its over
4018284 i think were definitely on the right track as a team
4018285 of course ken lucas played a big part in that
4018286 guys are still working and still battling and i think that is a great sign
4018287 like always there are always tougher times than others but i think we worked through everything pretty well i like this group so far

4018293 the area is huge and the big crocodiles are more skilful and they can dive longer than small ones
4018294 a person like me would not survive long in a canadian jail
4018295 we will do everything we can to support him during this troubling time in his life we are all in agreement that he should be extradited to canada to face these allegations
4018296 the suspect was quiet he wasnt agitated he didnt say anything at all
4018297 the investigation must now continue all victims of this man must make themselves known
4018298 he was restless he was charged with committing crimes against juveniles which can impose strong penalties if found guilty
4018299 we have enough evidence to take legal action against him the evidence is clear and thorough
4018300 we consider that this constitution has been approved by the people and by the end of august the constitution will be submitted to the king bhumibol aduyald for endorsement
4018301 we promised general elections later this year the exact date still under consideration it could be after the kings birthday on december 5
4018302 this is the first step in moving forward to full democracy
4018303 a lot of people voted yes not completely because they backed the charter but just because they wanted new election on december
4018304 i dont think this constitution will do anything for the poor it will only benefit the rich
4018305 the divisiveness is deep seated and the referendum has done nothing to change it
4018306 i think this constitution will be able to solve lot of problems that we have had faced in the past so definitely in terms of various clauses i think it is going to be appropriate for thai culture and politics
4018307 this is a critical transition for thailand so i would like to ask people to go out and vote
4018308 this new twist is expected to make them feel guilt and shame and prevent them from repeating the offense no matter how minor kitty is a cute icon for young girls its not something macho police officers want covering their biceps
4018309 thailand has fully respected and always adhered to the one china policy and views that the taiwan issue is chinas internal affair thailand hopes that no action which would jeopardize the situation across the taiwan straits and affect the stability and peace of the asian region will be taken

4018311 despite years of effort by law enforcement theyre not getting rid of it
4018312 not only is the problem worse in terms of magnitude of cultivation but production has spread all around the country to say the genie is out of the bottle is a profound understatement
4018313 theres no way to fly it all we know it marijuana is out there but theres always going to be something you cant find

4018324 i believe afghans are watching and will find a way to bring more technology to afghanistan

4018334 al qaida is identifying training and positioning operatives for attacks in the west including in the us these operatives include north american and european citizens and legal residents with passports that allow them to travel to the united states without an american visa
4018335 ability to establish and manage links to other affiliated terrorist groups and facilitation networks is a key indicator of its organisational health these links help bolster its operational and propaganda reach
4018336 since early 2006 pakistani militant groups have increased their collaboration with al qaida
4018337 i think i had it for breakfast the other day its good

4018340 what happens with bears is that their mothers kick them out of their den and they need to go find their own home range
4018341 very early in the morning enjoying an apple from an apple tree in someones front yard
4018342 one thing though about banville rushdie chabon etc writing crime novels is that they would never have ventured into the territory in the first place had not the zeitgeist begun to see crime books not as disposable pulp fiction but actually as interesting and important when the library of america started bringing out chandler hammett cain and highsmith in annotated quality hardbacks it was a sign that the critical community had embraced those writers and no longer despised them the rising tide began to float the boats of the whole genre
4018343 and yet if child 44 a serial killer novel that takes place in the last years of stalins russia appears at first glance to be a brash upstart a closer look suggests that its inclusion might not be so unlikely after all indeed this is the most recent example of the blurring of the line between crime fiction and literature which raises hope that the so called genre wars are lurching toward if not an end then at least a tentative cease fire
4018344 as soon as hes awake and theres a telephone nearby the answer to the question as to whos in charge will be jim smith

4018357 well ok answer me this when one of those lions comes at you all roaring and biting what you gonna do
4018358 well then i take that big chair they all carry and i stick it in his face until he backs down

4018369 when jon went to baghdad in 2005 getting around as a civilian wasnt easy and the city was tense it was impossible to move without your own security detail or a military escort but jon managed to secure meetings with key officials and commanders who were keen to see his program succeed
4018370 in my estimation the major reason federal funds were not secured was because it was impossible for the military to provide security in iraq for humanitarian efforts after 2006

4018404 he was wearing a stab proof vest and carrying a knife one of the questions you are going to have to ask yourselves is why
4018405 why didnt he disengage from battle what was he doing getting his knife out and waiting for the attack was that the action of someone acting in reasonable self defence
4018406 i am looking forward to making my debut for strikeforce at the playboy mansion an incredible venue that is well known throughout the world

4018413 i want to give them a view of baseball they may not have had before
4018414 we have a unique story that doesnt translate fully in print ads or 30 second spots
4018415 were a different kind of retailer by using drtv we can showcase clients who rely on us to provide solutions to their back amp neck pain doctors and educational websites like spineuniverse com who recommend us because of our understanding of the postural issues their patients are dealing with and helpful products that cant be found anyplace else
4018416 as a retailer with a very unique profile we think talking directly to our customers and answering their needs will be a huge benefit of this effort
4018417 we realized that amidst the gossip out there there were these little nuggets of inspirational gold that nobody was picking up and celebrating
4018418 we decided to change that with an online vehicle specifically designed to cover that scene
4018419 we didnt expect anything like this when we started ecorazzi it was supposed to be just a small little project from a couple of green bloggers who had never met each other
4018420 in fact a true virtual endeavor we didnt even meet face to face until eight months later
4018421 we decided early on that the need existed to not only cover the environmental passions of those in the spotlight but also the other important philanthropic efforts underway good deeds and acts of charity occur in the entertainment industry all the time we thought it was time to create a site that truly addressed these initiatives on a day to day basis
4018422 were always looking for the best of the best to add to our site
4018423 blueair was one of the horses that we wanted to add to our stable when we first started in 2006 but the blueair company was hesitant to add an unproven retailer to their growing list of dealers
4018424 we understood their position and never kept them out of our mind for the future time passed and we grew to the point where we were now a credible force on the web and ready to re approach blueair for another shot at selling their product on our site they liked what they now saw and gave us the green light to sell their air purifiers and other accessories on our website were excited
4018425 all you hear about these days is green this and green that
4018426 i was born on the very first earth day back in the 70s so the green movement has been around for sometime now but you hear so much more about it now that youd think that it was a new idea to conserve energy
4018427 if you ask me id say its the perfect time for us to have blueair on our site
4018428 with everyone concerned about the environment and saving energy we can do our part by offering products to our customers that can truly be called green products
4018429 blueair will fit in well with our other air purifiers because it fills in the gaps that we had in part of our line up
4018430 we try not to overlap our products on the site and confuse our customers its already a difficult decision for a consumer to find the right air purifier for them and we dont want to complicate that situation by offering too many products that are too similar in nature and price
4018431 were a simple operation just trying to find great products for our customers to purchase and then have them know that theyve made a quality purchase were proud to say that blueair and our other products can do that for them
4018432 the need for and interest in performance management in the nonprofit and government agency space is at an all time high im very excited to be a part of this event and look forward to helping mission focused organizations of all sizes use the balanced scorecard to execute strategy

4018526 we are receiving more calls all the time from companies dealing with slanderous blog and forum postings that appear on the first page of google when people search for their company name
4018527 we have successfully assisted a number of these clients and they are very appreciative

4018529 all the olympic athletes are understandably concerned about the air quality in beijing and how it will impact their individual performance we are happy to provide support with a product that not only aids recovery but also provides temporary relief from polluted air
4018530 one thing ive found most helpful is listening to others who have been through this and have found ways to deal with day to day issues of living with autism
4018531 in my research i found there was no single place for learning practical hands on knowledge of how to live with this so we developed autism hangout as a place where the autism community can come together to learn from others and contribute what theyve learned themselves
4018532 in addition to families and individuals affected by autism we hope to involve the professionals who serve those families and also the manufacturers that provide products they use
4018533 our community can provide great feedback about products for one thing our members really have to read labels carefully to be sure theyre following a proper diet and so on theyre more conscious of those things than the general population
4018534 there are not that many factors that can drive prices higher
4018535 the conflict in georgia does not have that much impact the pipeline was already offline
4018536 for our 5 year anniversary we simply wanted to come up with a marketing campaign that would leave our customers in a state of wow at a time where high gas prices are effecting the american families said wissem zarrouk ceo for piranha group inc we wanted to reward small business owners for something that they are already doing with a hotel stay which hopefully they will enjoy
4018537 the most exciting aspect about the web for businesses is the emergence of social networking
4018538 social networking services like facebook or myspace have created powerful new ways to communicate and share information but no one has yet applied this powerful application to community management this is groundbreaking and instrumental towards guiding the industry in a positive direction
4018539 in my personal experience the most difficult challenge starting out in the industry was the lack of guidance mentorship and training for dealing with day to day assignments thats what we want to provide through my condo coach support consulting collaboration training and mentoring for newly licensed and established managers or for board members simply grasping to figure out how to oversee the management of their association
4018540 its a great thing to be able to act as a team and join forces with colleagues to discuss the real day to day problems and solutions we encounter there really is no comparable resource in the industry and lcams with such a resource are going to be at a real competitive advantage
4018541 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4018542 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4018543 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4018544 it is becoming increasingly difficult to manage bad debt and charity accounts beside the growth of the uninsured population recent rulings by cms restate the current presumption of un collectability of bad debts associated with cost reporting while most providers eventually confirm insurance coverage the process takes place after services are rendered which minimizes the possibility for alternative arrangements and extends the period before bad debt can be recognized currently providers are being leveraged by higher costs overall and slower or non payment placing pressure on cash reserves todays environment demands anticipation and preparation earlier in the revenue cycle including improvements in more timely patient dialogue
4018545 we are excited to work with the klas leader in enterprise scheduling and surgery management to deliver our revenue 360 suite of offerings
4018546 usa recognizes the value we bring to the revenue cycle process and how this can assist healthcare provider organizations in collecting more revenue prior to the delivery of services combining these processes at the time of scheduling or pre registration places the provider organization in a position to better manage their patient billing process and immediately collect money from those with the ability to pay
4018547 as a longtime runner and avid believer in a healthy lifestyle im always looking for natural ways to train hard and stay healthy keeping myself and others going strong

4018551 development assets play an important role in many real estate investment portfolios
4018552 the dynamic nature of these assets makes tracking and managing these investments especially challenging you simply cannot do it quickly enough and make sure your results are reliable using spreadsheets
4018553 the incorporation of mark to market data into the loan information captured in portfolio maximizer removes yet another set of spreadsheets and potential failure points in the management and reporting of real estate portfolios
4018554 fees are such an important component of the investment management mix
4018555 until now visibility to these fees was limited with calculations buried in spreadsheet formulas so it was really easy to make a mistake
4018556 we are seeing pent up demand for portfolio maximizer fueled by the new realities in the marketplace real estate investors are forced to take a more proactive and systematic approach to the management of their real estate investments which cannot be satisfied with the hodgepodge of spreadsheets currently used by most firms
4018557 the enhancements delivered in this new version of portfolio maximizer will further help those that are looking to step up to the requirements of todays increasingly demanding real estate environment
4018558 we are very proud of this accomplishment cardioready certification exemplifies our commitment to the health and safety of our guests and employees

4018563 outindex therefore created our service based on our experience of encountering both live groupwise servers and backup tapes
4018564 american healthcare workers need to recognize that surface disinfection is essential in order to prevent the spread of infection
4018565 this feature has already been put into use by one of our industrial machinery suppliers when moving to digital information distribution
4018566 they needed to be able to set up multiple licenses for over 1 200 dealers and distributors for a new launch however they wanted to integrate issuing licenses with their existing web interface so that their dealers had a single common interface with them and not confuse them with multiple points of contact since the license files now show the dealers names they were easily generated and collected and organized internally by the manufacturer that meant that as the manufacturers new electronic service went live dealers received the announcement over their existing web portal dealers could pick up their license details directly from the web site using their existing interface for communications so its a win win for everyone the manufacturer knows who the license is for and can make sure it is in the right place to be collected the dealers retain a single point of contact and information and dont need to change the business processes they already have established and the manufacturer has cut out printing costs distribution costs can deliver rapidly and can issue new information immediately big cost savings
4018567 pawleys plantation continues to get better and better every year

4018671 hcm kills silently which is so tragic young athletes in their prime should not have to face this type of risk when a simple screening can give them the information they need to manage their health
4018672 i appreciate the opportunity for our kids as well as others from around the area to get screened sports physicals are great but this goes beyond and gives both the kids and parents more knowledge about a condition that can be so serious

4018687 they say people dont laugh enough so i thought id put some funny stories and good jokes where people can have a good belly laugh clean jokes of course
4018688 id also like to put up an inspirational corner to give people encouragement weve been in business for many years and weve always had a heart for children in africa who dont have proper water or food supplies and are suffering from starvation weve always sent money from our business and we want to inspire others to learn more and perhaps contribute on their own to these noble causes

4018709 admittedly concierge medicine is making some significant inroads into the healthcare community but there are important questions that need to be addressed concerning this innovative practice model
4018710 the range of fees goes down to as low as 39 per month for full care concierge services
4018711 the national average is less than 150 per month and membership levels as low as 50 patients the average practice has about 600 patients as its cap keep in mind the most expensive concierge doctor with the fewest patients is the white house doctor
4018712 such critics are short sighted insurance is the problem not the solution
4018713 most primary care doctors today run from room to room with seven minute visits accomplishing next to nothing in the pursuit of generating enough cpt codes to keep the office solvent half the money paid to health plans and government for health care is wasted
4018714 concierge doctors have been shown to cut high tech and hospital costs by as much as 60 85 insurance is not a useful tool in the delivery of primary care such care should be purchased directly thus eliminating the costly meddlesome middle man
4018715 keep in mind the average concierge fee today is less than 150 per month most americans pay more for cable cell phone bills and cigarettes concierge medicine costs like cell phones are going down and such care is being used by more and more average americans that trend will continue most innovations start with wealthier people and then become generalized
4018716 our special report on concierge medicine raises concerns for all segments of the healthcare community though an interesting concept it remains to be seen how widespread concierge medicine will be adopted by patients and practitioners who generally agree that improving customer service is a priority in our consumer driven society
4018717 expectations are high this is holmgrens final year and you cant help but think something special is going to happen
4018718 but i am really looking forward to the revamped running game and seeing some new faces on the field
4018719 we are first and foremost sports enthusiasts getting fans into the games comes naturally to us its what we love to do
4018720 we have enough things to worry about keeping business going and making sure we give good service and now we have to worry about asking people if they want water
4018721 we do live in the desert and we forget that but we need to be water wise so i think its excellent
4018722 this is no different than what they did about 20 years ago when they started this
4018723 ive been asking for 20 years when i want water so this is nothing new
4018724 fr he hilfen f r eltern und kinder und soziale fr hwarnsysteme
4018725 die familienbegleiterinnen besprechen mit den frauen nicht nur wie die kinder gesund aufwachsen und wie man die wohnung kinderfreundlich gestaltet
4018726 sondern auch wie man die elternrolle ausf llt und wo man sich hilfen holen kann und wie man trotz des kindes das berufsleben nicht aus den augen verliert
4018727 egipto parec a que iba de modesta y ya ha dado alg n susto
4018728 this will only work if its an international solution i would love for there to be a simpler solution if we could just tick a box and move on it would make everyones life easier but now this really is a long term behavioural and educational campaign
4018729 we looked at things like doctors certification and body mass index and decided that for us it wasnt the appropriate recommendation we felt it was wrong to force a girl to have a physical examination especially because the signs of a problem arent always obvious
4018730 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
4018731 how did a dumpy little thing like you get a hunk like that
4018732 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and my core beliefs
4018733 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail ok i dont believe that unless he also happens to entertain a death wish i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
4018734 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
4018735 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4018736 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4018737 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4018738 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4018739 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4018740 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4018741 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4018742 the velocity control and breaking ball were all working as well as they can
4018743 i tend to try to place my pitches and get them to put the ball in play
4018744 he is one of our best pitchers in terms of knowing how to pitch
4018745 he has had some shoulder injuries but the man knows how to pitch
4018746 if they continue to have quality at bats were going to score some runs
4018747 in a situation like this the first runs mean so much and we were fortunate to get rolling until that point we were taking nothing for granted and nothing lightly
4018748 man i ties labai smagu kad a v l susitiksiu su tv3 i rovais naujasis amplua man labai patinka ir jau iuosi a kaip sakoma savo rog se ir laida smagi ir kolega puikus darbas sekasi gerai ir tuo esu labai patenkinta
4018749 routinely invented sensational stories faked interviews ran phony pictures and distorted real events
4018750 we will shoot the balance part in our visakhapatnam studio post production works are also going on simultaneously these days nuclear families have become vogue and joint families are almost on the extinction if people join together with all their families to celebrate festivals how it would be is being shown on the screen through this flick we are making efforts to release the film in september
4018751 i play the role of a muslim girl it has different elements like love and action and i have got a very good opportunity to give a good performance in this movie
4018752 i am very happy that i got a chance to work with senior artistes in my debut film
4018753 avneet needs experience and think she was not prepared enough of course none expected her to win a medal but she was not in the best shape of her shooting career and it was a very okay sort of performance
4018754 shoot on sight orders are a clear violation of the right to life and of international standards of law enforcement
4018755 with violence escalating the troubled state of jammu and kashmir is again at the brink of catastrophe
4018756 to end this cycle of tragedy the government should order security forces to act with restraint and all parties should try to settle the dispute peacefully
4018757 ik denk dat de iphone enkele onderliggende infrastructuren vanuit een enterprise perspectief verandert maar apple is behoorlijk slim geweest wat betreft design
4018758 as far as what i know there was a sudden accident
4018759 with great reluctance and yet a sense of firm conviction
4018760 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias budget and immediate cash needs
4018761 the idea of providing 8 billion for state of the art healthcare for murderers like charles ng richard allen davis and scott peterson is sheer lunacy
4018762 i think he has to be a part of the team and he cant be floating out there by himself because otherwise everyone would be out there trying to derail him
4018763 will continue to work cooperatively with the receiver and the legislature to move forward in a fiscally responsible way to provide the necessary funding for the receivers efforts
4018764 the federal courts have clearly indicated for 30 40 years that inmates have not lost the right to receive basic medical care
4018765 so there is a constitutional obligation here this is not something the state has a choice about
4018766 providing e mail updates of his activities before and after the big night media interviews visits with the virginia delegates and backstage moments at the big event you name it
4018767 the kind of language he uses and the kind of behavior he exhibits in the public domain toward women objectifies them and leads to bad things for our society and to domestic violence
4018768 im really looking for the guy whos going to be the most consistent theyre all up and down im anxious to see how this plays out to me somebody needs to separate himself
4018769 we want to score a lot of points and we want to secure the football
4018770 its going to be the same with troy were going to be aggressive in everything we do offensively were not buttoning down anything ever
4018771 everybody makes mistakes and it just took them awhile to make mistakes
4018772 at least they didnt know how to speak english just chinese
4018773 and theyd show it on sportscenter highlights or something like that
4018774 hes always been the quarterback always been the safety probably was a point guard in basketball
4018775 he runs the show and knows the game any game hed be a playmaker in anything he did
4018776 having coached a secondary you have a good idea of the picture you look for back there
4018777 ed is good enough to change the picture just a little bit
4018778 in other words he doesnt have to be positioned quite as deep or quite as wide or quite as tight as another guy would and still be in position to make the play you see why hes made so many plays over the years kind of by baiting quarterbacks a little bit hes got a real knack for that
4018779 we dont want robots on defense and we dont want the offense to know exactly what were in ed will move around eds always in the structure of the defense if hes not weve missed a call or something like that nothing ever has been intentional where hes been out of position i think what happens is people see him moving around and think hes freelancing
4018780 he knows the defense so well he knows the strengths the weaknesses of it
4018781 he knows what the offense is trying to do hes a great student of the game when that opportunity to make a play happens he makes it he doesnt drop it
4018782 he helped me get up to speed watching film and learning the game
4018783 this is a full time job so if you want to be great the film study is what separates you from the guys who dont do that stuff
4018784 coming here and working with a veteran team ray lewis sitting down with him thats just something that keeps getting better over time
4018785 a lot of guys are smart or have street smarts this kid has both he sees the game at a slower pace
4018786 no im just a little enthused about what i do im happy
4018787 i love doing this i wouldnt trade this for the world
4018788 he talks a lot of trash but he backs it up also if youre not mentally tough hell get you out of your game quick so i like to have him on my team
4018789 i just bring an attitude out there as a corner
4018790 my whole thing is i want them to come at me if it takes me talking to the receiver for him to go back there and tell his quarterback hey lets go at walker i want that work i want it on my back my shoulders
4018791 im trusting it more im not scared but im just being careful
4018792 i dont need to run the ball im just here to hit guys and just provide leadership
4018793 for example for every fugly smelly mos person theres another fugly smelly mos person
4018794 there are many different paths to take hilary was a divisioni swimmer whitney was swimming at age 14 in rome and michael is well hes michael
4018795 i swam in a meet at the end of the year
4018796 i ended up getting a third place trophy and i said to my mom i want a bigger trophy well honey these kids swim year round and they practice all the time that was it
4018797 because we were swimming since he was able to walk he was at meets all the time he kind of grew into it
4018798 they did a lot of watching after michael too certainly as far as swimming goes michael didnt know anything other than being intensely focused on swimming if his sisters were lackadaisical maybe he wouldnt be doing what hes doing but he never knew any other way to do it
4018799 she could train like no other girl ive ever seen
4018800 its just hard when you see these other people making it people you were swimming against and i had no control i couldnt control my back
4018801 but as i got older matured more i looked back on my career and realized i did a lot more than so many others i should be proud
4018802 i always wonder what a fourth child wouldve been like
4018803 because when i was younger i was gung ho about practice swimming was my life and i was a decent college swimmer then theres whitney who was a little more hesitant to start swimming and then she was really great
4018804 michael was different no way didnt want to put his face in the water i hate practice keep me away and now hes the best ever
4018805 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4018806 used his experience in business to help deliver jobs and hope to the citizens of virginia
4018807 contributed to the all time low in cotton acreage planted in the state
4018808 the southeast has experienced a period of serious drought for more than a year now
4018809 we do not have any indication that he knew chairman gwatney
4018810 kept asking to see the chairman and she tried to stall him but he went past her and she heard three gunshots
4018811 she was sitting here going over it in her mind he was a white man in a white shirt with khaki pants middle aged
4018812 its very sad to hear that something like this has happened to him
4018813 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4018814 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4018815 it is indeed a tragedy for not only the city but the entire state of arkansas
4018816 i know sometimes in these days and times we see these senseless tragedies i hope we can learn the facts of this
4018817 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
4018818 his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us
4018819 all of these elements that were internal were comfortable with but the external macroeconomic items we dont have visibility of so thats why we cant provide guidance for 2009
4018820 i think its more about the visibility and the increased cotton and energy prices and people are nervous about what does that mean for 2009
4018821 our business is very strong weve never had a larger open order position in the history of the company during the third quarter so were very excited and optimistic about our volumes for next year
4018822 we believe that another flood at the cigar lake mine is likely to raise more questions about the viability of the operation over the longer term and this could be the catalyst that the uranium market had been looking for to jolt it out of the doldrums
4018823 we would not be surprised to see a delay in the remediation plan and anticipated start up by at least six months while clearly negative for cameco this event should provide a much needed boost to uranium market sentiment
4018824 it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax
4018825 just because a bill comes to the floor with offshore and energy in the title doesnt mean its a good offshore drilling bill
4018826 speaker pelosi is only going to schedule a vote on an offshore energy bill if she believes it would be politically perilous not to and even then its not going to have much energy in it
4018827 and ill bet you when members come back from their districts youll find more movement taking place
4018828 its nonsensical that its safe to drill off the coast of texas and louisiana and mississippi and yes california but its not safe to drill anywhere else the average hardworking american doesnt understand that
4018829 always concerned about the push for more drilling off our coasts from the oil industry and its supporters
4018830 a huge erosion of support for the moratorium among democrats
4018831 i guess you could call it one of our fun indexes
4018832 the sponsors of the winter games have already been announced so we will make the switch at the december review for the dow jones 2008 summer games index
4018833 this is all about bailing out the subprime lending industry
4018834 they will have checks written to them by the state of california if this goes through
4018835 the governor continues to urge republicans and democrats in the legislature to reach a compromise
4018836 he believes the legislators understand that we are running out of time
4018837 we do feel it is important for businesses and any taxpayer to be made whole
4018838 democrats would not ever agree to any provision that would benefit subprime mortgage companies
4018839 i cant comment on whats being discussed in budget negotiations but republicans wont support anything that hurts our economy
4018840 this is a chemical we dont want babies exposed to
4018841 the fetus and newborns are at the most unprotected stages of their lives once the harm occurs it never can be undone
4018842 is a federal regulatory system that is completely incapable of dealing with chemicals that generate huge amounts of income for very powerful lobbying groups
4018843 it has been up to the states and individuals using civil litigation to deal with these situations
4018844 let scientists do the work instead of politicians looking for sexy issues
4018845 people are dying because of the inadequacy of our current transplant system so why arent we reaching out to find the best solution why is this being done secretly in the smoke filled backrooms
4018846 imagine if they asked a bunch of transplant people to run the blood transfusion system that would be laughable
4018847 this is a joke but its not a joke for the canadians who are dying
4018848 this is clearly a major step forward toward providing comprehensive organ transplant services to canadians
4018849 there are questions and appropriately so about what this new system will be
4018850 we dont see blood and organs as similar products because theyre not but there is a service delivery model in place that can be taken advantage of to improve the organ donor system
4018851 this is in no way shape or form a power grab
4018852 if people have problems of a partisan nature they should not use a death of a firefighter or anything associated with the disaster to deal with it
4018853 i felt like slapping her but i wouldnt do that
4018854 if it were my child i would not be worried
4018855 i have a house with broken windows that i have every reason to believe is full of asbestos the nerve of you people to act so goddamn smug
4018856 sesuai tupoksi tahun 2002 asrama memberikan pelayanan akomodasi pembinaan akademik dan budaya
4018857 bulan maret kita melakukan revitalisasi asrama kita tidak lagi menggunakan konsep man to man di gedung tapi menggunakan struktur organisasinya agar lebih berfungsi kita menetapkan beberapa manajer berdasarkan bidangnya masing masing sebab mendekati penghuni asrama adalah kewajiban kita bersama
4018858 akhirnya kita membuat program yang lebih membangun softskill seperti rasa empati tanggungjawab kejujuran kepemimpinan
4018859 saya menekankan memantau pola makan penghuni asrama untuk mengetahui keadaan sosial ekonomi mereka
4018860 pola makan tak bisa dibohongi dan sangat berkorelasi terhadap keadaan ekonomi keluarga mereka
4018861 sementara itu dalam hal cyber harapan kami dan juga harapan mahasiswa adalah cyber di asrama putra dan putri bisa diaktifkan lebih awal
4018862 untuk ini kami telah berkoordinasi dengan staf pengajar jika tahun lalu mahasiswa yang dipanggil untuk dilakukan evalusi red adalah mereka yang nilai ip nya kurang dari 1 5 sekarang ini mereka yang nilai ip di bawah 2 00 pun akan dipanggil untuk dievaluasi hal ini dilakukan dalam rangka menekan angka drop out
4018863 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4018864 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4018865 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4018866 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4018867 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4018868 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4018869 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4018870 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4018871 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4018872 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4018873 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4018874 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4018875 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4018876 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4018877 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4018878 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4018879 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4018880 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4018881 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4018882 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4018883 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4018884 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4018885 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4018886 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4018887 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4018888 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4018889 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4018890 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4018891 the key thing about this is that the process will be fully automated so there is no requirement for a skilled person to use the technology
4018892 theres nothing to say that a veterinary lab assistant couldnt go out and swab birds and run the test at present tests have to be sent to a lab where you need fully trained personnel and thats where the hold up occurs

4018964 ha llegado el momento de que el presidente ruso haga honor a su palabra
4018965 si rusia est violando el alto el fuego y tengo informes que no son muy alentadores al respecto entonces esto servir para profundizar el aislamiento internacional en el que rusia se est moviendo

4018992 we have come to realize that all of the enforcement tools in the world cant make somebody pay if they dont have the money
4018993 the bottom line is that for poor fathers these laws are just unrealistic
4018994 i could barely live off the 600 i was making
4018995 it means reaching out to those men who want to do the right thing who want to pay child support but who need a little help getting there

4019007 americans increasingly believe that news organizations act out of their own economic interest and journalists themselves act to advance their own careers
4019008 we do have credible reports that russia has taken actions that violate the cease fire agreement and thats what the president was referring to
4019009 i cant get into specifics but we do have those reports and were concerned about them and we are working to get concrete information its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
4019010 it is very difficult to get accurate situational awareness in real time in a crisis that is fast moving
4019011 this is a motorized conflict in a relatively small area and that means the situation on the ground can change very quickly

4019047 there seemed to be a policy assumption in the department of education that every new school at second level should be multi denominational we dont accept that should be the case
4019048 committed to denominational education and intended to remain a provider as long as parents choose catholic schools
4019049 relegate them to the past and seems to consign their role in school ownership to history
4019050 i feel that it is important to place on the record unambiguously what heretofore could be assumed but now needs to be expressly stated namely that the catholic church makes no apology for its ongoing presence in education delivery
4019051 the matters fall into the wider space of the planning for future school provision
4019052 they will be considered along with the views of other patron interests and the wider education partners as future policy in this area evolves
4019053 this would have involved all relevant stakeholders from the bishops to the department to teachers parents and politicians and would have allowed all issues to be fleshed out
4019054 a national forum would allow public debate and would make any other arguments as seen yesterday with the bishops comments unnecessary it should be established immediately
4019055 clearly however there is a demand from parents for multi denominational education
4019056 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression

4019058 back in 2002 mr ian smiley and i went to china with a bottle of home brewed and distilled moonshine at a local government welcome banquet we opened the bottle and passed the liquor around everyone liked the taste of it
4019059 it is almost like chinese traditional bai jiu white liquor but smoother and with a hint of sweetness immediately the head of the county mr jianguo han and mr guangqian hu wanted us to establish a distillery in their county they offered us tax incentives land usage license assistance right at the dinner table they made us an offer we simply could not refuse
4019060 liquor is a high tax revenue product for local provincial and the state government therefore they want the distillery
4019061 mr hu immediately pointed out that there is no chinese made whiskey on the market and all the imported whiskey aged in oak barrels has a strong oak taste which is very hard for chinese people to swallow he obviously recognized the high potential for moonshine whiskey in chinese market
4019062 china is a people country which means that the rules and regulations are often bent if the merit is evident the local government is willing to alter any regulations to push the project
4019063 my wife doesnt like the idea of producing moonshine and i am not a drinker
4019064 but mr han patiently pointed out to me that the moonshine project as the first whiskey distillery in china would bring not only employment to the local people but also boost the name recognition of his county and build its image attracting even more investment
4019065 if we can share 1 of the chinese liquor market we would be able to employ hundreds of people as well as spending millions of dollars at the local markets this would help local people tremendously since china is consuming about 4 9 billion liters 1 3 billion gallons of bai jiu white liquor a year
4019066 before the end of the year you will be able to bring a bottle of famous moonshine whiskey from china made from an appalachian recipe and distilled by a state of the art german distillery more than legally

4019074 the opportunity for the development of leisure oriented real estate in russias key cities is significant russia continues to benefit from a relatively strong domestic macroeconomic situation while translating investments into tourism infrastructure in addition the establishment of regional casino gaming zones in russia could ultimately attract the development of large scale integrated resort projects resulting in additional tourism value drivers

4019081 bankkunden m ssen um ihr geld f rchten wenn sie eine unberechtigte abbuchung nicht bemerken denn es scheint derzeit keinen wirksamen schutz vor unzul ssigen abbuchungen zu geben

4019085 die gescogruppe ist schwungvoll in das neue jahr gestartet wir bekr ftigen daher unsere planung f r das gesamtjahr die vor dem hintergrund allgemein verhaltener konjunkturerwartungen bereits eine gewisse beruhigung im zweiten halbjahr impliziert
4019086 unsere technologisch f hrenden wechselrichter sind in deutschland und international sehr gefragt im ersten halbjahr haben wir die verkaufte wechselrichterleistung auf 895 mw im vergleich zum vergleichszeitraum in 2007 mehr als verdreifacht dabei profitieren wir weiterhin davon dass wir weltweit als einziger hersteller photovoltaik wechselrichter f r alle anwendungsarten alle solarmodultypen und alle leistungsbereiche anbieten k nnen

4019088 einige der auftr ge von denen wir erwartet hatten dass sie im laufe des quartals abgeschlossen werden sind aufgrund fehlender essentieller hardware komponenten in das dritte quartal gerutscht wir haben jedoch einen rekord gesamtauftragsbestand von ber 30 mio us dollar f r mam und grafikprodukte aufgebaut daher sind wir weiterhin zuversichtlich die zum jahresanfang genannte prognose zu erf llen
4019089 mit blick auf mam bersteigt die nachfrage unsere aktuellen lieferkapazit ten wir unternehmen schritte zur erweiterung des personals um von dieser starken nachfrage zu profitieren die anforderungen unserer kunden in diesem sektor sind f r uns noch h ufig eine herausforderung und sehr arbeitsintensiv aber wir erzielen gute fortschritte beim verbessern unserer internen betrieblichen abl ufe und steigern dadurch unsere effizienz ltere komplexe und ressourcen stark beanspruchende projekte befinden sich kurz vor dem abschluss womit sich spielr ume f r die annahme und bearbeitung rentablerer projekte erschlie en
4019090 im bereich der grafiksoftware gibt es obwohl wir das vorgegebene ziel einer wachstumsrate von 20 im quartal bisher nicht erreicht haben keine sichtbaren zeichen f r eine verlangsamung des gesch fts unsere prognose bezog sich auf das gesamte gesch ftsjahr und der existierende auftragsbestand rechtfertigt die annahme dass wir dieses ziel erreichen werden

4019094 future currency movements and energy prices and their impact on the global economy are notoriously hard to predict against this backdrop meeting the annual group targets we projected in the spring of sales in the region of 1 6bn and a pre tax profit close to last years level poses something of a challenge but as long as there is a real chance to reach our targets we see no reason to lower our sights any significant deviations will be made public without delay

4019108 we are pleased to settle with the fsa so we can now move forward
4019109 the sudden and unexpected announcement of the writedown had the potential to undermine market confidence
4019110 its hard to judge where prices may go we are in a period where prices are adjusting to new levels buyers and sellers are struggling to find out what that new level is the market will determine it not us or the government once we have reached that level then prices should normalise but that does not mean back to levels seen early last year that were clearly excessive
4019111 funding is not something the central bank can supply it would be a very dangerous move to move to a situation where the government saw its major role as guaranteeing lending
4019112 why should the taxpayer take on the risk of borrowing by individual borrowers some of whom are risky its the lenders who should take on the risk pretending theres a magic solution is not the answer
4019113 the bank cant provide funding to finance investment that has to come from mobilising savings in the economy at home or abroad to fund investment thats what the financial sector is there to do
4019114 i may yet recommend that the government should not intervene in the market on the grounds that such intervention would create more problems than it would solve
4019115 its the riskier borrowers who are finding it more expensive

4019119 we are encouraged that management has taken steps to ensure some resilience to changes in demand in the future capacity reduction and fuel hedging combined with the merger synergy benefits provide some reassurance that the group will be able to cope with a downturn
4019120 we are probably one of the best hedged companies out there
4019121 while we are encouraged by these early results we are increasing our flexibility to give us the levers to pull in tougher market conditions including fuel price hedging and capacity management in all our markets
4019122 arsenal were rattled they knew they had been in a game
4019123 we opened up arsenal but the final ingredient was not there
4019124 we knew we had to have a good start and the first half was important in europe against the top teams you dont get many chances and you have to take the ones that you do we failed to do that and we got punished
4019125 we had one bad spell in the second half conceded the goal and that deflated us
4019126 twente played with belief and spirit and in the first half they had the better chances
4019127 in the second half we took over they had given so much in the first half they could not keep up the same pace we looked comfortable but they gave us a tough game
4019128 we were lucky not to concede a goal clearly we didnt play well but the result was good the positive thing was the result and sometimes you dont seem to say too much because everybody knows i told the players that it could be like this and very aggressive it was difficult for us to get the ball
4019129 if the team dont play well the strikers dont get the chances
4019130 i think its a moment and we have to forget our project was to learn against a team like liverpool
4019131 the problem is that you have to score there and thats difficult liverpool when they arrived they slept a little bit now they have woken up

4019186 right now in the us in particular we have a really strong concentration of the industry
4019187 so a lot of people are really concerned about this do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies

4019193 me gusta que entren los tiros pero me preocupan mis sensaciones
4019194 est claro que me gusta que entren los tiros pero no es lo que m s me preocupa me preocupan mis sensaciones me preocupa ser til al equipo creo que los puntos y el tiro son una faceta importante para un equipo y que si a veces no est s acertado concentras tus energ as en otras cosas
4019195 a lo mejor he llamado un poco m s la atenci n porque han entrado un par de tiros pero en los dos primeros partidos casi no he anotado y creo que he ayudado al equipo cada d a estoy preparado y en una cancha de baloncesto hay muchas cosas que hacer adem s de meter puntos
4019196 son muy buen equipo y a las nueve de la ma ana es inc modo jugar para todos tampoco es para tirar cohetes pero estamos contentos de lo que hemos hecho en el encuentro
4019197 es muy complicado son los grandes favoritos a la medalla de oro nosotros nos lo tomamos con tranquilidad pero creo que hay m s revuelo alrededor nuestro que dentro del equipo tanto si ganamos como si perdemos va a valer un punto como el de alemania o como el del ltimo partido frente a angola

4019217 alan greenspan usually surrounds his opinions with caveats and convoluted clauses
4019218 i suspect that we are coming to the end of this downtrend as applications for new mortgages the most important series have flattened out i dont know but i think the worst of this may well be over
4019219 the drop in u s home prices will probably end well before early next year as the number of houses on the market diminishes aiding an economic rebound
4019220 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4019221 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4019222 a necessary condition for an end to the current global financial crisis
4019223 stable home prices will clarify the level of equity in homes the ultimate collateral support for much of the financial worlds mortgage backed securities we wont really know the market value of the asset side of the banking systems balance sheet and hence banks capital until then
4019224 at 82 years old mr greenspan remains sharp and his fascination with the workings of the economy undiminished but his star no longer shines as brightly as it did when he retired from the fed in january 2006
4019225 its the imbalance of supply and demand which causes prices to go down but its ultimately the valuation process of the use of the commodity which tells you where the bottom is
4019226 for example the grain markets can have a huge excess of corn or wheat but the price never goes to zero itll stabilize at some level of prices where people are willing to hold the excess inventory we have little history but the same thing is surely true in housing as well we will get to the point where there will be willing holders of vacant single family dwellings and that will no longer act to depress the price level
4019227 theres no credible argument for bailing out bear stearns and not the gses
4019228 they should have wiped out the shareholders nationalized the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted with necessary taxpayer support to make them financially viable as five or 10 individual privately held units
4019229 make them financially viable as five or 10 individual privately held units
4019230 one is the supply of vacant single family homes for sale both newly completed homes and existing homes owned by investors and lenders he sees that excess supply roughly 800 000 units above normal diminishing soon
4019231 there is nothing free market about central banks lending out freshly created money
4019232 theyre over there fighting for my freedoms which i enjoy very much and theyre leaving their families and their wives and most of them have smaller children
4019233 theyre over there worrying about their life for one thing but on the other hand theyre worrying about what their children and their wives are going through if i can help them that way then thats a little less worry that they have
4019234 i asked them why they thought they needed to do that and they said it was to ease the pain of us being gone and that it was a small price to pay for what we were doing
4019235 its too bad all employers arent this good to work for and its easy to see how easy it is to work for them for 26 years
4019236 theyre all pretty humble people anyway but when they come back theyre so appreciative
4019237 with the other people listening to them out there on a daily basis i think it makes the other people better americans and makes them appreciate what they really have here
4019238 its a great honor for me to be selected as one of the recipients

4019243 its hard it gets easy it gets fun again whats hard to sustain is some ideal that its perfect thats ridiculous whats fantastic about marriage is getting through those ebbs and flows with the same person and looking across the room and saying im still here and i still love you you re meet reconnect you have marriages within marriages within marriages thats what i love about marriage thats what i want in marriage its unfortunate but we live in a very disposable society those moments where it looks like uh oh this isnt working those are the most important transformative moments most couples draw up divorce papers when theyre missing out on an amazing moment of deepening and enlightenment and connection

4019266 it was a terrible shame not because i didnt win a medal but because i let so many people down but they all gave me lots of support and encouragement i wasnt in a good mood and i just wanted to quit it had all become meaningless

4019271 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4019272 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4019273 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4019274 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4019275 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4019276 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4019277 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4019278 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4019279 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4019280 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4019281 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4019282 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4019283 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4019284 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4019285 dalam apbd tahun 2004 hingga 2007 terdapat penyimpangan dana dan mark up mencapai miliaran rupiah kejati jabar harus bisa mengungkap karena sudah dapat perintah dari kejagung

4019291 at southwest airlines we monitor more than 100 travel and airline industry blogs a day

4019295 we do have credible reports that russia has taken actions that violate the cease fire agreement and thats what the president was referring to
4019296 i cant get into specifics but we do have those reports and were concerned about them and we are working to get concrete information its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
4019297 it is very difficult to get accurate situational awareness in real time in a crisis that is fast moving
4019298 this is a motorized conflict in a relatively small area and that means the situation on the ground can change very quickly
4019299 i think this is a significant lack of policy and analysis
4019300 i think the administration has most of what they need
4019301 im sure we have a lot more information than theyre discussing publicly
4019302 we have to fight back the challenges of terrorism and extremism

4019348 during the investigation it became apparent that the registrant was holding morning surgeries on exactly the same basis as dr gray himself she was holding open morning surgeries on occasions when dr gray was not there or when he could not do it himself
4019349 we say the scope and remit of these open surgeries either held alongside dr gray or alone went far beyond anything she was qualified or experienced to do as a nurse practitioner
4019350 a lady came in with a prescription it was signed by dr gray despite the fact that i knew he was on holiday
4019351 the reason why i went across to the surgery was the quantity of one of the prescriptions was for one capsule there was no locum doctor on duty at that point i was told by the receptionist that the quantity should be 28
4019352 i was told that it was authorised by dr gray i was not satisfied with this because it was obvious dr gray was not on the premises
4019353 its a strain and im certainly not getting any younger

4019359 our proposal was not prompted by any sudden deterioration in conditions at fannie mae or freddie mac
4019360 ofheo has reaffirmed that both gses remain adequately capitalized at the same time recent developments convinced policymakers and the gses that steps are needed to respond to market concerns and increase confidence by providing assurances of access to liquidity and capital on a temporary basis if necessary
4019361 the plan we announced will strengthen our financial system as we weather this housing correction and establish a new world class regulator for the gses
4019362 let me stress that there are no immediate plans to access either the proposed liquidity or the proposed capital backstop if either of these authorities is used it would be done only at treasurys discretion under terms and conditions that protect the u s taxpayer and are agreed to by both treasury and the gse
4019363 there is a significant chance probably better than 50 that the proposed new treasury authority would not be used before it expired at the end of december 2009

4019464 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4019465 its not the intention of the u s to take control of facilities
4019466 i strongly doubt that russian prime minister vladimir putin is going to be deterred by the prospect of a u s humanitarian effort
4019467 a stall in this situation would have caused the gliders right wing to drop which would have led to autorotation and a steep nose down attitude

4019540 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4019541 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4019542 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4019543 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4019544 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4019545 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4019546 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4019547 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4019548 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4019549 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4019550 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4019551 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4019552 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4019553 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4019554 accessible education is a right not a privilege of the upper class

4019578 none are conventional mls vendors we think what we can build is something based on technology used by sites like trulia zillow google

4019580 they were based on historical mls boundaries that had no relationship to the marketplace
4019581 to engage in armchair ing in academic disciplines would be to argue for a position without considering and researching what other people have said about it to armchair is to fail to engage with the live debate on an issue and be doomed to irrelevance which is why it is a bad idea to put too much stock in armchair anyones

4019590 a computer simulation gives voice to a long extinct dinosaur
4019591 each student will be given a ball of clay and a strip of tag paper 6
4019592 the students will learn about fossil dating students will make their own fossils in order to gain a better understanding of how fossils are created http www sciencenetlinks com lessons cfm docid 128 a lesson plan for grades 6 8 on dinosaur fact and fiction movies and books is testament to the fact that these extinct animals fascinate us however entertainment has a tendency to misrepresent scientific knowledge and blur the lines between scientific fact and imagination for most students dinosaurs are the large scary animals in the movies this lesson allows students to differentiate between fact theory and speculation as they relate to dinosaurs students also make their own theories using relevant evidence thereby practicing the use of logical reasoning finally students examine recent evidence that challenges the prevailing theory that all dinosaurs were cold blooded
4019593 students need to know not only about scientific facts and discoveries but also about the processes by which scientists conduct their investigations this lesson has students trace the steps of a paleontologist from determining where to look for dinosaur fossils to studying the completed dinosaur skeleton for clues about the dinosaurs behavior diet and anatomy
4019594 join us now for an online egg hunt and catch the excitement of fossil researchers as they
4019595 had the tyrannosaurs and triceratops looked down they would have found trilobite fossils beneath their feet that were already five hundred million years old

4019597 the united states and the world expect russia to honor that commitment
4019598 i specially checked it with the general staff of the russian armed forces there are no russian servicemen supporting the peacekeeping operation in georgia in poti
4019599 we are not making any secret of that they are staying there to neutralize the large arsenal of weapons and other military hardware in the areas of gori and senaki these arsenals remain unguarded apparently those who guarded them fled
4019600 aimed at ensuring the peace enforcement operation in respect to the georgian side which violates all of its obligations
4019601 with the purpose of demilitarizing the zone adjacent to the conflict area and also guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population russian peacekeepers are evacuating this hardware vehicles and ammunition
4019602 we believe the russians are consolidating their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia and will not significantly expand their ground presence in georgia
4019603 we believe the russians will fall back to their pre crisis boundaries we do expect russia to retain a military presence in both enclaves for the long term
4019604 we do see a halt to offensive military operations if there is a formal cease fire we believe the russians will adhere to it while reserving the right to use military force to respond to threats against their troops
4019605 russian tanks continue to ravage georgia town and villages killing people destroying buildings looting theyve been doing worst things to what ive heard in the past and i could never imagine happening in my country
4019606 the civilian population should be protected against all encroachments on their lives and dignity

4019609 wax coated cardboard boxes for example used for packaging fruit arent recyclable
4019610 we have a different kind of process for separating the sugarcane into its component parts so that the lignin is still useful
4019611 it can be put back into the pulping process to make recycled paper
4019612 we also get the advantage of replacing a wax material from a petroleum resource a finite resource with biomass a renewable resource
4019613 the groups outlook remains strong for the 2009 financial year sustained by a record level of work in hand

4019622 the loss in value due to foreign exchange for the cyclone nargis international humanitarian aid during the last three months has been about 1 56 million dollars
4019623 we are not getting the full value of dollars donated for emergency relief and donors are extremely worried and keen to see that this issue is resolved
4019624 i would like to go to amman to stand trial however what i fear is that i would be convicted in advance
4019625 i made the cartoons to highlight that there are some terrorists who misuse islam and they take it as their spiritual ammunition
4019626 i wanted to depict the terrorists as if they were taking the prophet mohammed as a hostage i have no problems with islam but with the terrorists
4019627 i respect islam and its followers and i have nothing against it however i will not apologize we have freedom of the press and religion in denmark
4019628 we used them as a kind of documentation to show the public what we are talking about in the stories
4019629 rwes power production unit has exceeded my expectations and the results demonstrate that we can expect a further strong development for power production as well as for the oil and gas unit in the rest of the year
4019630 therefore i expect significantly better earnings in the second half and rwe to beat its earnings expectations
4019631 results slightly exceeded expectations but the market is waiting for august 19 when the group will revise its budget
4019632 it seems we will not have a downward revision in forecasts but one should also not expect a considerable change upwards the market reaction should be slightly positive

4019636 i wanted to view it through an ecological prism and look at it as a biological state

4019638 the idea that discussing or simply understanding an illness will in some way make the hard wiring that caused it disappear is as most people who have been through it acknowledge wishful thinking
4019639 the less my life seemed to resemble that of the marginalised voyeur id cast myself as
4019640 i realised id written what was virtually a short book and that i had my life back again

4019656 but we believe our measures for charity are strong and promote transparency

4019700 that is a massive advantage for the second leg but we will be on our toes in the first half they had some chances but in the second half we slowly took over they had given so much in the first half they could not keep the same pace and tightness in their marking from then on we looked more comfortable
4019701 i think we should have scored in the first half
4019702 estados unidos de am rica apoya al gobierno democr ticamente electo de georgia insistimos en que la soberan a y la integridad territorial de georgia deben ser respetadas

4019705 we are very pleased with the results achieved by our students this year a smaller cohort than the previous year they have performed in a way which reflects the hard work put in by themselves and the support of their teachers and parents
4019706 the overall pass rate has shown a slight improvement over last year and continues the steady rise over a three year period
4019707 our congratulations go to every one of these students and we wish them good luck for the future as they use the fruits of their hard work to take them on to the next step
4019708 i think they all have strengths i think theres things that we can try to play to each of their strengths i dont normally like to do that but i can see us doing that
4019709 switching up quarterbacks isnt bad it gives a different dimension
4019710 it kind of puts a lot of pressure on defenses
4019711 obviously im looking for consistency and guys who can make plays on a consistent basis

4019721 its a great honour for me its a huge honour
4019722 but these are the olympics and anyone can make a mistake maybe then we can deliver a surprise
4019723 fridays competition also sees the qualifying rounds for the mens and womens individual pursuits 4 000 meters for men and 3 000 for women with two opposing riders starting on opposite sides of the track

4019729 the dark energy is simultaneously decreased just in front of the ship to decrease and bring to a stop the expansion rate of the universe in front of the ship
4019730 if the dark energy can be made negative directly in front of the ship then space in front of the ship would locally contract
4019731 we are still a very long ways off before we could create something to harness that type of energy
4019732 pico d is an exceptionally smart looking product but after you carry it in your pocket and use it for a while you realise that theres much more to it than handsome looks very few other usb drives can measure up to the pico d in features performance and quality
4019733 our engineers and manufacturing people fussed over minute details for months before we took pico d to production so the finished drive has an unmatched feel of quality to it

4019747 eds one of the partners of the transys consortium has sought to challenge the procurement arrangements for the new contract transport for london are vigorously defending this challenge and have appealed against the interim court order we remain committed to delivering better value for money and to ensuring a seamless transition to any new contract from 2010
4019748 these negotiations were successful and a new contract called the future ticketing agreement has been prepared under which cubic would provide ttl with all services from 2010 to 2013 it was ttls intention to sign this contract simultaneously with terminating the existing transys contract

4019768 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
4019769 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4019770 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4019771 what is clear is that the complete russian victory in this small but nasty war has created a new reality on the ground
4019772 not just in georgia but in relations between russia and the west
4019773 the extradition procedure is difficult complicated and time consuming and we cannot predict the timetable
4019774 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4019775 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4019776 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
4019777 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
4019778 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
4019779 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
4019780 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
4019781 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
4019782 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
4019783 we have been under siege for the last two years
4019784 the only thing left is for them to invade and kill us
4019785 if the cease fire is just a front for extremists in gaza to rearm and regroup of course we have the right to act
4019786 any arms buildup is a direct violation of the calm that was achieved
4019787 they control the gaza strip with quite an iron fist if you dont mind me saying and none of this activity with the other groups would be happening unless hamas was complicit and allowing it to happen
4019788 right from the beginning i have always believed and also expressed the peoples republic of china the most populated nation very important so the international community should not isolate china must bring it into the mainstream of the world community
4019789 and certain principles such as democracy human rights religious freedom rule of law in these principle matters you should be firm
4019790 i think a lot depends on what happens over the next few weeks
4019791 if we are able to have continued access in terms of humanitarian supplies to these people if there is safe space for the civilians in that area if both sides respect their responsibility to allow displaced people to move where they want to move they i think a crisis can be avoided

4019834 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
4019835 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
4019836 our work needs to be seen in the context of all this other work and the news is very very grim
4019837 we have driven the rate of biological extinction the permanent loss of species up several hundred times beyond its historical levels and are threatened with the loss of a majority of all species by the end of the 21st century

4019839 the consumer is still under enormous pressure as employment is declining real wages are down housing and stock market wealth are down and credit conditions continue to tighten
4019840 this data is consistent with our bearish forecast of personal consumption throughout the second half of 2008
4019841 going forward a tight credit environment a deteriorating labor sector and elevated prices will act as a significant constraint on consumption
4019842 there is potential inflation outside of oil and the credit markets get a little nervous when they believe that food and energy price inflation might spread
4019843 you feel like youre in this deep dark hole and you cant get out
4019844 they talked to me and i remember that for the first time i didnt feel so alone
4019845 i felt so much better knowing that these folks had been through a similar experience and they were now helping others
4019846 i especially love working with patients in the emergency room and the crisis unit
4019847 you have a chance to have an impact on them right away sometimes we just sit with patients other times people want to talk about their pain and trauma i feel so privileged when people want to do that and that i can be there for them
4019848 their job is to provide support comfort hope and compassion to patients while they are in the hospital
4019849 their experience is unique someone who has been through a mental health crisis really has the ability to help someone else going through the same thing its a powerful message of hope and comfort
4019850 they might be hallucinating or confused the peer advocates can meet with them and give them companionship and comfort they have the time to spend with patients
4019851 its a biological disorder it doesnt mean people are weak it doesnt mean there is something wrong with who you are it just means you are challenged in that area people recover all the time
4019852 traditionally people with mental illness have been told they dont need to work or they are not capable of working
4019853 we are trying to increase the percentage of people in our community with mental illness who work even part time
4019854 its something people really struggle with especially people with depression it feels like hopelessness but the reality is that almost everyone will recover at some point
4019855 sometimes you go in and people will say no said kathleen
4019856 thats fine but when they start telling you their story i listen i try to listen more than talk

4019862 onze aandacht gaat nu uit naar de integratie van recente overnames
4019863 liberias wars since 1989 have cost tens of thousands of lives and left many people mentally and physically traumatized this conflict has been characterized by ethnic killings and massive abuses against the civilian population between 1989 and 1997 and again in 2003 and 2004
4019864 both female and male former combatants who experienced sexual violence had worse mental health outcomes than non combatants and other former combatants who did not experience exposure to sexual violence
4019865 like their female counterparts male former combatants who experienced sexual violence have worse mental health outcomes than both the general population and also other former combatants
4019866 rehabilitation programs that do not address this specific population risk failing a critically vulnerable group
4019867 this unexpected finding suggests that standard post conflict rehabilitation programs and gender based programs will need to adjust current programming to take into account males who have experienced sexual violence especially former combatants
4019868 imagine if everything bad that you ever imagined happened on the same day
4019869 i trained with her for four years and she specifically requested that i not join the last training camp before the olympics
4019870 i had nowhere to train for the last four weeks my coach gabor salamon is very resourceful and he arranged for me to train with the hungarian modern pentathletes
4019871 it was highly irritating and i thought i could fight through it
4019872 mentally i felt ready i felt prepared and then i just sucked through the last three minutes
4019873 in the beginning i was relaxed and my hits were pure then my shoulder started to tense up and if you just watched the body language she was aggressive and i was tense
4019874 i guess that was the turning point she started taking my blade and i wasnt able to move enough i didnt have the relaxation to get around the blade
4019875 i imagine if i was a man its like getting kicked in the groin repeatedly thats how bad it feels you want to curl up and die
4019876 im trying to put it all into perspective and its tough you train so long and i feel like i disappointed myself my coach my family my country everybody
4019877 i just want to do my job thats the worse part of fencing you lose and you hit the showers
4019878 i know no canadian taxpayer wants to hear that i really did try my best and did give everything that i have but i swear to everyone that i did and im really sorry that i didnt bring home a medal
4019879 my psychologist is going to kill me if he reads this
4019880 hell say all that work we did on you being able to accept your losses
4019881 the only thing i can say is that its definitely not going to kill me so it can only make me stronger
4019882 give me a couple of brandies and ill feel better
4019883 it doesnt make me more worthy or less worthy as a person while i apologize to all of canada its really just a medal its really just a match
4019884 im just going to take some time to deal with this
4019885 im excited about the new challenge that im going to be faced with
4019886 even though ive been teaching eight years im a new teacher here
4019887 we set aside this time so we can help new teachers make the transition to the county as seamless as we can
4019888 we want to make sure that they understand the community and the expectations that we have for students in this community this is an important time for our new teachers we want to give them the resources they need to be successful
4019889 im excited because i will have a chance to learn and perfect my craft
4019890 in baltimore city i had a lot more disciplinary issues that had to be addressed im excited to be in an environment where discipline issues wont be as prevalent
4019891 it gives them an awareness of what is going on
4019892 you only get one chance to make a first impression
4019893 you have to learn how to adjust to that staff you have to fit into the program
4019894 tonight the city is full of morgues and all the toilets are overflowing

4019909 the athens has remained alive in so many hearts and minds because of the many many special memories there
4019910 people came out of the woodwork to share with us things like their first kiss being in the athens their first date getting engaged there having their last date there before their husbands went off to war taking their children there

4019926 tutti quanti e tutti iniziano a cantare anke da morti evviva tornato topo gigio
4019927 no treaty between the federation and any other country shall have the force of law except to the extent to which any such treaty has been enacted into law by the national assembly
4019928 if indeed the government believes in its own rule of law and due process mantra
4019929 nigeria is a signatory to the icj nigeria is a responsible member of the of the international community nigeria is an aspiring member of the security council so we have to put all these into a basket
4019930 we put ourselves in a tight corner what the president is doing is being careful by making sure that we dont jeopardise the overall international interest and obligations of nigeria on account of this unfortunate but avoidable mess in bakassi
4019931 but we have already found ourselves there nigeria initiated the legal action we took the matter to the icj if we did not believe in the authority of icj we should not have gone to court in the first place
4019932 another view is that having gone to court and seen the way it was going we should have pulled out but we did not do that we stayed there and the judgement landed on our lap
4019933 this is a delicate matter and nigerians should see it as such there is nobody who is happy that any territory of nigeria is going away i know that even when southern cameroun left there was a hoopla in the country
4019934 we have already been assured contrary to speculations that that part of bakassi is not really very heavy with mineral deposit as alleged
4019935 the item that consummated the agreement spelt out that on no account should cameroun constitute an impediment to nigerian military forces having access or exit from bakassi into the nigerian water that has been the major security issue that was raised and that has been addressed in the green tree agreement
4019936 if indeed the government believes in its own rule of law and due process mantra
4019937 no treaty between the federation and any other country shall have the force of law except to the extent to which any such treaty has been enacted into law by the national assembly
4019938 even if the government has scoffed at the ruling of justice muhammed umar of the federal high court sitting in abuja restraining the fg from handing over the peninsula until the determination of the case brought by bakassi indigenes it cannot afford to trash the nigerian constitution
4019939 the temptation to go ahead with the handover just to win some immediate favours from the international community especially by an administration that is standing on one foot is so great but succumbing to it will bring more pain than joy at the end
4019940 we therefore join well meaning nigerians and organisations to appeal to the yaradua administration to do the right thing before handing over bakassi in line with the icj ruling nothing is sacrosanct about august 14 that it cannot be deferred
4019941 it is also for the country to ensure peace and good neighbourliness in the continent and the world
4019942 we urge you all to remain calm and cooperate with the federal and state governments to ensure a smooth and memorable handing over ceremony
4019943 by providing ample opportunity for those willing to promote enterprise
4019944 the ictr is in the process of working through a completion strategy that will see the court wind up in 2010 it is thus imperative that africans are engaged in discussions concerning a permanent home for the archives and other residual issues
4019945 the parliament has performed higher than we expected compared to the estimations we had at the beginning of our mandate
4019946 theyre over there fighting for my freedoms which i enjoy very much and theyre leaving their families and their wives and most of them have smaller children
4019947 theyre over there worrying about their life for one thing but on the other hand theyre worrying about what their children and their wives are going through if i can help them that way then thats a little less worry that they have
4019948 i asked them why they thought they needed to do that and they said it was to ease the pain of us being gone and that it was a small price to pay for what we were doing
4019949 its too bad all employers arent this good to work for and its easy to see how easy it is to work for them for 26 years
4019950 you go to work every morning knowing that you work for good people
4019951 theres no other employer that tops them they deserve the red carpet treatment from the army for what they do
4019952 theyre all pretty humble people anyway but when they come back theyre so appreciative
4019953 with the other people listening to them out there on a daily basis i think it makes the other people better americans and makes them appreciate what they really have here
4019954 its a great honor for me to be selected as one of the recipients
4019955 for my employees to nominate me for that that was an awesome thing im just proud to be a part of it
4019956 the notion they dont even know where these sites are is even more disturbing than the fact they seem to inspect them every three years
4019957 so far this arrangement has been pretty effective other than this incident
4019958 if that means something needs to change with regards to the tssa we will look at all that
4019959 its time for the government to acknowledge that this experimentation this flirtation with privatization has been a failure
4019960 if we felt those were of sufficient magnitude that required an increased level of actions then certainly we would have taken them at the time
4019961 business records change on a continuous basis like any data i know that we make every effort to be as current as possible
4019962 people are dying because of the inadequacy of our current transplant system so why arent we reaching out to find the best solution why is this being done secretly in the smoke filled backrooms
4019963 imagine if they asked a bunch of transplant people to run the blood transfusion system that would be laughable
4019964 this is a joke but its not a joke for the canadians who are dying
4019965 this is clearly a major step forward toward providing comprehensive organ transplant services to canadians
4019966 there are questions and appropriately so about what this new system will be
4019967 we dont see blood and organs as similar products because theyre not but there is a service delivery model in place that can be taken advantage of to improve the organ donor system
4019968 this is in no way shape or form a power grab
4019969 it is a principle on which rpf inkotanyi is built that we work together with other political parties that wish to but the ultimate decision of whether we are going to campaign with these parties will be taken by the political bureau
4019970 we are going to further scrutinize these candidates from the primaries to come up with the required number several criteria will be used including the candidates ability to get votes from the electorate
4019971 the number of delegates has been growing for the past years it now stands at 15 743 and over 13 000 turned up for the primaries
4019972 rwanda environment management authority rema provided scientists who carried out desk studies from which a team of experts from unep will pick key environment drivers facing the country that can have impact on the countrys long term development programmes
4019973 unep does not initiate environmental assessment in any country it only comes in when invited by the government of a given country
4019974 we hope its findings will be our environmental conservation baseline
4019975 an assessment is important because it studies the evolvement of ecosystem in natural resources like rivers lakes forests and swamps most of which are shared by different countries
4019976 pasi n y negocio el arte en la venecia de los siglos xvii y xviii
4019977 ignore the observations of thousands of people over thousands of years as well as the true pace of medical progress which is at best herky jerky and aimless
4019978 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4019979 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4019980 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4019981 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4019982 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4019983 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4019984 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4019985 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4019986 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4019987 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4019988 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4019989 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4019990 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4019991 i am not going on a spending spree i plan to bank most of it that is what i have got to live on for the rest of my life
4019992 naturally colin is relieved and it will go some way to compensating him for the vilification that he has received at the hands of the public and media for the least 16 years
4019993 in some peoples eyes he will always be the bloke who got away with murder
4019994 people need to be waking up to the realities of the world and that the days of easy money have come to a pretty sudden end
4019995 there is an awful lot of talk about big transfers and major demands of players but you will find throughout the uk and europe that money is not quite as easy to obtain as it used to be
4019996 were expecting the levels of transfer fees this summer to still to be quite high but probably not as high as the record that was set last summer
4019997 euro 2008 happened towards the start of the summer transfer window
4019998 the level of transfer activity at the start of a window sometimes decreases when there is a major tournament taking place
4019999 another factor is that the 2008 09 season is the second year of a three year broadcast deal and the level of broadcasting revenues to clubs this year will be broadly similar to what they received last year
