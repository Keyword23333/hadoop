2570000 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2570001 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2570002 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2570003 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2570004 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2570005 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2570006 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2570007 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2570008 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2570009 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2570010 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2570011 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2570012 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2570013 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large
2570014 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
2570015 we will work with canada and mexico to amend the north american free trade agreement so that it works better for all three north american countries
2570016 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
2570017 tough practical and humane immigration reform in the first year of the next administration
2570018 just everywhere out here laid out on the ground they are bloody
2570019 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2570020 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2570021 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2570022 it was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2570023 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield
2570024 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2570025 if it was high enough at the time it would have been able to see the battle of culps hill
2570026 would have been able to see the union guns there on the crest of cemetery hill firing at picketts men
2570027 and looking to the south it could have seen the entire union line stretching from cemetery hill to the round tops
2570028 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2570029 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2570030 its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2570031 its really important to recognize that we dont see this as a new bar that wed need to spend more and do more and more and more
2570032 he is known as a person who has supported the olympic movement for so many years
2570033 no one has ever seen an opening ceremony like this
2570034 china made a statement that this was a new beginning a new century and that they will move forward
2570035 the labor cost for that can you imagine thousands of union people the cost would be prohibitive
2570036 well build for the sport and for whats appropriate for chicago
2570037 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2570038 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2570039 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2570040 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2570041 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2570042 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2570043 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2570044 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2570045 in life there is limitless potential with limitless potential comes limitless possibility and with limitless possibility comes limitless understanding
2570046 when you look at our natural world of possibility with the shades of conclusion you eliminate the multitude of possibilities for a conclusion that a question possess and increase the the possibility of the conclusion you choose being incorrect
2570047 you must choose direct the fighters to kill your friend or tell batman the wrong directions leading him straight to germany
2570048 ha to the joker because his plan with courtney backfired which meant batman might save her she had never met batman before but she could tell he had a great body
2570049 every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines hanging on in quiet desperation is the english way the time is gone the song is over thought id something more to say
2570050 i cant remember much from being in a coma but i do remember that when that song came on it took me right back to when i was a youngster
2570051 i could remember how excited i was to get it down at the record shop
2570052 i suddenly had a burst of energy and knew i had a lot more life left in me and thats when i woke up to the sound of the first song i ever bought
2570053 i would love to thank mick and the rest of the stones personally i feel they really did help wake me from my coma
2570054 justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done
2570055 would it not be easier for the government to dissolve the people and elect another one
2570056 in three days 9 people died and 17 were injured in traffic accidents in phnom penh
2570057 recently the un development program office undp decided to delay the transfer of funds for the salaries of more than us 300 000 for khmer officials and staff of the khmer rouge tribunal after there were complaints about corruption at the cambodian side
2570058 the un spokesperson of the khmer rouge tribunal mr peter foster said that some cambodian officials and staff had lodged complaints to the un relating to corruption and to some other irregularities a un oversight office in new york checking internal problems is investigating these cases
2570059 it should be noted that the undp administers the funds to provide the salaries of khmer staff from the cambodian section of the site
2570060 this new scandal makes the public aware that the international community starts to have less and less trust in the khmer rouge tribunal because the scandal of 2007 is not yet solved and now there is another shameful scandal
2570061 recently officials of the khmer rouge tribunal reported that the trial of kang kek ieu called duch the former chief of the tuol sleng prison will be conducted in september or october but what causes serious concern is that the khmer rouge tribunal is facing a serious financial crisis and it is facing a shameful corruption scandal
2570062 nevertheless khmer citizens in cambodia and abroad want the trial of duch as well as of other former senior khmer rouge leaders to happen as soon as possible as long as they are still alive and are able to reveal facts while standing trial
2570063 observers of the khmer rouge tribunal since it was started said that if this mixed tribunal has the intention to find justice for more than 1 7 million khmer citizens who were killed during the killing field regime the trial of duch has to happen in september or october as planned if not it means that the khmer rouge tribunal has no intention to find justice for the victims and khmer citizens will never see the light of real justice therefore the international community and donor countries must press on with the khmer rouge tribunal to try the suspects soon as a warning for the next khmer leaders not to repeat a cruel massacre like the former khmer rouge leaders committed
2570064 we cant think of it in the big picture we just have to think of it as if were going to the gym and doing our job which weve all been doing for years now
2570065 weve all just got to stay calm and if we do that we can do great things

2570072 i was raised in technically savvy company everybody from my grandfather father uncle were involved in technology in some shape or form my grandfather and father were pioneers and definitely leaders in communication technology in czechoslovakia
2570073 when i worked for nokia it was during my post grad studies at the czech technical university in prague i was working in tempere for the r amp d department for nokia definitely working for nokia was a highlight of my career at that time
2570074 hub international is an umbrella for insurance companies through north america they came to us to create a portal for all their employees and to be able to cross various divisions and to be able to share the experience expertise and knowledge within this large group a collaboration portal where people could share information not only across geographical distances but also different business groups
2570075 at that time it was quite a revolutionary undertaking 1998 99 it was a feature that through a browser the editor or a news reporter could update the story real time on the fly today nobody thinks twice about it but at that time it was quite revolutionary for them
2570076 we have been as a company in business for over thirty years we see that the technology is coming to the marketplace at such a speed that even for seasoned it professionals it is sometimes difficult to keep up with all the technology our aim with the pacific coast informer on the formal side and my blog less formal we want them to stop and think about all the implications that technology has on their lives for example one of the issues which is important to me is privacy and security
2570077 every time you want to implement any technology start first with the business understand why you are doing it where is the benefit to the business another is to find seasoned professionals who understand both the technology and the business
2570078 its like when you go food shopping you go into places where you know you can get fresh food which wont make you sick the same thing applies to people browsing the internet go to websites which can prove to you that they are serious about protecting your personal information and your privacy and your secure transactions
2570079 businesses have to understand where the technology makes sense and how they can compete on the global level and how to do it as efficiently as possible
2570080 the market is opening and the competition is increasing we are trying to improve our internal business processes we are trying to minimize the time being spent on unproductive tasks and we are trying to make our organization as lean and efficient as possible we are trying to identify all the issues which other companies are facing and then deliver solutions which are helpful to these organizations
2570081 if one can create great encryption there are always people who are smarter who can break the encryption the moral of the story is if you dont want to lose something dont put it on your computer
2570082 to stay informed i spend about two hours every day reading on the internet i subscribe to about 15 newsfeeds from various vendors or publications from around the world wikipedia because of our work with major vendors ibm microsoft novell etc they supply us with information from their point of view but i would say the most important thing for me is talking to other it professionals that cannot be substituted for anything else
2570083 technology is here to help us but it is the connectivity to other people who are knowledgeable and who can provide great wisdom and perspective on things that is the ultimate for me i am looking forward perhaps as a result of this podcast that i will be able to talk with similar minded people
2570084 wow poor georgia they are no doubtingly getting owned unless they get some help of course even then its rather iffy

2570124 state lawmakers approved new measures this year to ban senior judges such as fuller who do not face re election from hearing death penalty cases they also tightened the public defender systems budget
2570125 defense lawyers have an obligation to investigate what those witnesses would say at trial fuller said
2570126 the journal of educational psychology asked fourteen leading experts in the field at that time to provide their definitions of intelligence as one might expect the journal got fourteen different answers back some of the responses received can be summarized as follows the ability to carry on abstract thinking l m terman having learned or the ability to learn to adjust oneself to the environment s s colvin the ability to adapt oneself to relatively new situations in life r pinter
2570127 few concepts in psychology have received more devoted attention and few have resisted clarification so thoroughly

2570154 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2570155 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2570156 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2570157 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2570158 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2570159 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2570160 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2570161 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2570162 i am no music scholar but i feel i know appropriate church music when i hear it last sundays new hymn if you can call it that sounded like a sentimental love ballad one would expect to hear crooned in a saloon if you insist on exposing us to rubbish like this in gods house dont be surprised if many of the faithful look for a new place to worship the hymns we grew up with are all we need

2570212 program information software code or command that would assist another in any material way to circumvent or otherwise attack the security of the fare media system
2570213 it has been a disappointment how this whole situation was handled from their end
2570214 disclosure of this information will significantly compromise the charliecard and charlieticket systems
2570215 from publicly stating or indicating that the security or integrity of the charliecard pass the charlieticket pass or the mbtas fare media systems has been compromised

2570220 it has been known for years that magnetic stripe cards can easily be tampered with and mbta should not have relied on the obscurity of their data format as a security measure

2570441 he is a normal person and has never been spoken to about anything like this before
2570442 maybe the police in chile have got the wrong person
2570443 i spoke to his fiancee lorena and she is obviously concerned and upset
2570444 si alguien quiere y d jame llevarlo a un grado chusco por qu nada m s condones vamos repartiendo un six de cerveza y vamos dando vales para el motel de modo que el gobierno pague la diversi n de los j venes

2570449 you dont really talk about it but this sport will eventually kill you
2570450 i watched my hand get crushed i was bathing in my own blood
2570451 they tore down the berlin wall now theyre building another one i dont understand why
2570452 you have completely flipped from your questionnaire either you werent truthful on your questionnaire or you werent truthful here
2570453 someone sat you down and schooled you on what to say
2570454 if folks feel like they can kill someone and there is no real punishment then they will continue to do it
2570455 if the computers off when this is supposed to run run it as soon as you can
2570456 otep s leadership and the participation of her fans is a fantastic example of many people working together for a positive outcome the passion of the otep community is clear through their actions and comments on the carbonrally site this team now over 600 strong will certainly inspire others to take action reduce co2 and be a positive force against climate change
2570457 i am so proud of our supporters who have dared to care and get involved i am honored to work with carbonrally and am grateful to have a platform such as this the earth belongs to all of us what we do to her we do to ourselves
2570458 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry in the russian arsenal they have launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2570459 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2570460 if the russian side is simply convinced it wants to keep pressing the attack militarily there is not much the georgians can do theyre being hit very hard so we have to rely on diplomacy
2570461 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2570462 one big rumor gets out there and it kind of spreads quickly which is cool
2570463 im glad people are speculating on what the records gonna be we want to keep some of the mystery behind it until the record hits the stands but the record is not based on the life of rasputin
2570464 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2570465 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
2570466 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
2570467 though we did experience some difficulty with all the members of the warren commission ford was of considerable help to the bureau
2570468 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2570469 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2570470 obviously it turns a defining element of his biography his reputation as a devoted family man upside down
2570471 but if he shows a continued commitment to his core issues and no additional facts emerge that contradict his story he could eventually join the disturbingly large club of public figures whove rebounded from similar events
2570472 did you know somebody started a poll on the times standard topix site that asks do you really believe ted sillanpaa played baseball at college of the redwoods

2570476 like bagman689 and i admit to being considerably older than him i grew up watching this great cartoon show and as an adult find that i still enjoy catching a toon or two when i have the chance
2570477 portals and other distributions services impose their own rules and limitations supposedly indie friendly distribution options like steam and instant action still have subjective gatekeepers
2570478 if you want your game to make money you have to consider what will sell and this means adapting your pure creative vision to match the real world
2570479 since we are a small developer that has a hard time getting attention you would think we would have very little piracy
2570480 unfortunately thats not the case at all its depressing how many sites are pirating depths of peril

2570494 this wasnt something imposed it seems that this backtracking would be the result of the backlash from anti muslim hate web sites and islamophobes on the internet
2570495 i would have thought that people would have been more sensitive and sympathetic to the concern to the members of our community who want to celebrate their religious faith
2570496 its a little disingenuous to say that they tyson were responding to employee concerns the proposal came from workers themselves
2570497 for over a hundred years labor day has stood as a symbol to honor the working men and women of this country but for the past few years traditions like labor day have been under attack this time its gone too far and we as patriotic americans must draw our line in the sand

2570502 the tremendous downtown changes have given the residents a renewed sense of confidence and optimism about the future of the city
2570503 externally its really helped us to reset the image of kansas city
2570504 in order for us to go downtown and bring jobs into downtown we wanted cordish to push along with their plan under a specific timeframe
2570505 we wanted an area that would attract the kind of employees h amp r is looking for
2570506 people are back downtown with their pets with their bikes and vespas
2570507 but the area also provides the best options for larger blocks of space at competitive rates

2570514 what the city needs is the mother of all convention centers in the region
2570515 in 24 hours its gone from 1 55 to 1 50 which is highly unusual that changes your game plan for the marketplace
2570516 this is payback time for the european currencies against the dollar
2570517 these currencies have to retreat to better reflect the sharp deterioration in economic fundamentals in the euro zone region this is not to say theres been an improvement in u s fundamentals
2570518 confirmed that the window of opportunity for further rate hikes has been slammed shut by the cold blast of negative data releases that swept through the euro zone in the last few weeks
2570519 lots of investors have been on high commodity prices and a low dollar and those bets are getting destroyed

2570525 today i cant believe it i cant believe im here
2570526 if they dont water the greens during the day as i think they did on thursday the greens were pretty hard and firm and fast at 9 oclock so theyre going to be really firm and fast by 2 30 or 4 oclock
2570527 this is probably the toughest course ive ever played the rough is high and even if youre a good driver youre going to miss four fairways and the greens are tricky youre always putting up slopes
2570528 but somebodys going to enjoy it by the end of the week
2570529 the bridge has frequently been on the front page its strange
2570530 most of the time people dont think much about what we do
2570531 but they have to regain public confidence and this is one way to keep people informed people need to recognize they can trust the infrastructure
2570532 all four bidders would have built an equivalent product to satisfy the state
2570533 in the eye of the beholder they were equal the state could have saved 77 million by having us do the job
2570534 flatiron manson should only be entitled to the value they delivered and that value may well be lower than the contract amount
2570535 if things go our way we will not get one cent we would get the satisfaction of having the excess earnings going back into the treasury and of putting politicians on notice thats what is in it for us
2570536 theres a lot of emotion behind the bidding process because of the circumstances
2570537 i think theres a lot of pride with the local contractors they obviously wanted to get this job im sure they were disappointed that a contractor from out of state got it from them but thats the way the process works
2570538 and committed to doing a very high quality product and doing it safely its a competitive process we have good local contractors but we dont give favoritism to local contractors
2570539 gosh they poured 100 yards of concrete isnt that something
2570540 i realized there was opportunity for me in the u s
2570541 and i figured finally this would shake up a few politicians this country needs to spend far far more than it does on infrastructure and particularly on bridges many bridges are 40 years old
2570542 there has been a lot of talk about the incentive bonuses but the majority of that money is going to pay for the acceleration of the project
2570543 my brains hard drive was erased but the operating system was intact
2570544 i dont know the woman either why do i even keep this
2570545 memory for practical skills is stored in different brain regions from memories for autobiographical events hence the possibility of losing one kind but not the other
2570546 at one point i wondered if she was bipolar because she could be so different
2570547 she had burned some bridges with us from her behavior but now i really think she was losing it in pieces she was losing chunks of things and we didnt realize
2570548 she says she lost all these things but how could she know songs
2570549 the block is in some sense psychological rather than neurological and can be reversed
2570550 shes come a long way down from where she used to fly but shes done the best she can with it id say at this point her memory loss is probably permanent simply because it has been 10 years and it hasnt come back
2570551 i didnt really care about my past i didnt know what a normal memory was i just explored everything everywhere i went was the most amazing place
2570552 one day i sat down with my dad he used to be a history teacher and over four hours he related the history of the world that was the most fascinating day of my life
2570553 i do not know any of this stuff its like its someone elses
2570554 we eventually realized we were doing it for ourselves and i basically had to accept that this was a new person it was interesting getting reacquainted with a person who acts like looks like a person you know really well but is not that person for her i was this new person who for some reason just kept hanging out in her life now i feel like ive got back the sister i knew when i was young
2570555 you were sure you were going to be a bag lady
2570556 john was turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again
2570557 shniderman holds two masters degrees in educational psychology and social work and has 26 years of experience as a chief staff executive in not for profit organizations
2570558 150 000 above the average for groups with similar revenue
2570559 it was a capricious decision made personally by mike carlin because he didnt like mike parobeck s artwork or my writing and believed that senior citizen super heroes was not what dc should be publishing he made his opinion clear to me several times after the cancellation
2570560 we created this film to expose the serious unfairness in the system in order to help effect positive change for millions of families men women and children the situation is beyond absurd we have loving fit fathers who want to be there and support their children who are unfairly prevented from doing so on the other hand we have men proven by dna testing not to be the dad yet they are forced to financially support children they may not even know and did not father
2570561 both mothers and fathers are tired of being unfairly vilified pursued and stereotyped when it comes to financial child support they say it doesnt help their children or families when the main breadwinner is devastated humiliated threatened or constantly pursued by a misguided and ill informed system unfair illogical harsh punitive measures against alleged nonpayers such as lifting drivers and professional licenses and jail are not helping children and families
2570562 i wanted to convey these loving parents stories in a compelling way and to give these parents a powerful voice children want and need both parents in their lives children suffer and miss their parents when theyre unjustly separated from them following divorce or family breakup they need adequate time with both parents which often doesnt happen in our current system
2570563 i wish that those involved would refrain from bad mouthing my sister
2570564 confirms the right every california child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children
2570565 this provides better mobility for employees many of them woodland residents and decreases the number of cars on highway 16
2570566 unomig with its 133 unarmed military observers is in no sense a peacekeeping operation
2570567 peacekeepers who are partaking in a peacekeeping mission in accordance with the charter of the united nations are not parties to the conflict and for the purposes of international humanitarian law are treated as civilians and are protected from being objects of attacks however peacekeepers are required to maintain neutrality and not become a party to the conflict if russian peacekeepers in south ossetia act in a manner that is not neutral and become a party to the conflict by taking a direct or active part in hostilities they lose the protection afforded them as civilians peacekeepers who use their protected status to carry out attacks are acting perfidiously which is a serious violation of international humanitarian law

2570578 there is something graceful and effortless about this performance which not only shows what it might feel like to be the last man on earth but also demonstrates what it is to be a movie star
2570579 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2570580 we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august 6th
2570581 to urgently convene a meeting of the european council at the level of heads of government
2570582 the territorial integrity of georgia is currently being violated on an enormous scale
2570583 there are bombardments civilians are dying foreign military forces are on georgian territory
2570584 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central europe
2570585 we did not accept military intervention by milosevics serbia in other yugoslav states on the grounds of protecting serbian passport holders
2570586 the eu and nato must take the initiative and stand up against the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy in the east of europe
2570587 the russian federation has overstepped a red line in keeping the peace and stability in the conflict zone and in protecting russian citizens outside its own borders
2570588 a worsening of the crisis could affect the whole region with its negative consequences
2570589 in this sense it is also a question of a violation of international law as soon as you start to go down the road of military action
2570590 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2570591 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognised my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2570592 i think they need to work through that process of healing
2570593 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2570594 violence against women violates the rights and undermines the dignity of our sisters mothers and daughters it undermines our democratic victory
2570595 as we celebrate our women on this day we remember gail and many others whose lives were brutally snuffed out through unacceptable criminal violence
2570596 equally we would like to make an earnest appeal to community structures and in particular families to stand up against and report incidents of women and children abuse
2570597 they are also less involved in the formal banking sector but they do have more store cards or retail accounts
2570598 national womens day is the celebration of the role and contribution of women to public life in the struggle for freedom in the building of a new non racial and democratic south africa and in building our future
2570599 these efforts appear to be designed to turn the day into something frivolous similar to either valentines day or mothers day
2570600 i figure we might be glad to have a quart of beans to eat
2570601 oh maybe in the fall you can come back just to visit

2570761 im not convinced that this kind of micromanaging is equipping anybody
2570762 a nation of wimps the high cost of invasive parenting
2570763 because they have been over monitored over pressured they have sort of been building portfolios of excellence since they were in kindergarten

2570766 didnt create a protective bubble around their kids or insulate them from the events or the people who seemed get in the way of the children thats the happiness police trying to thwart anything in the way of their kids happiness
2570767 a generation or two ago parents would commiserate sorry theres a lot of homework thats just the way it is do your best

2570776 the past few years have been great ive always enjoyed watching them on tv

2570778 i went to school in connecticut and there were a lot of yankee fans so i had to deal with a lot of trash talking

2570792 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2570793 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority

2570796 i hope not but i have not budgeted my time well

2570913 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2570914 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2570915 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2570916 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2570917 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2570918 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2570919 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2571015 there is a theologically superficial enthusiasm that makes involvement in social ethics a substitute for the substance of an uncertain faith such a position creates mistrust and hampers and delays progress toward christian unity
2571016 the most important contribution that christians can make to human unity would certainly be to regain their own unity the path to this goal lies through mutual recognition of one another in faith and this must find its expression in the achievement of sacramental fellowship
2571017 to be sure the church is not an end in itself it already manifests the future fellowship of the kingdom of god which is to include all mankind a renewed mankind that has passed through the judgment of god for the community of mankind can be realized only through overcoming the evil in its midst by means of gods judgment on that evil
2571018 human effort cannot bring it about but to work toward it is a natural consequence of the sacramental nature of the church as an effective sign of this future destiny of mankind a part of its nature as a sign is that the church cannot be understood as a goal in itself but has as its goal the future kingdom of god over all mankind the content of that hope for gods kingdom is the unity of mankind that is human fellowship in peace and justice as an effective sign of this hope the church therefore if it is true to its god given origin and essence is to promote peace and justice throughout the world
2571019 the church can be an effective sign of the future unity of humanity only if the church itself is one its own fragmentation reflects the divided state of the world thus the unity of the church is not merely a desirable goal for christians but one without whose realization the church cannot still exist
2571020 if a christian knows how provisional his or her own insights and way of life are then that christian will be able to bring to the encounter with person who live on the basis of non christian traditions an awareness that their lives may be related to the same divine mystery to which his own christian faith is related
2571021 christians should be fully aware that according to the message of the new testament it is not we but the christ who is coming again who will decide whose life and conduct are faithful to the norm of the kingdom of god which he proclaimed in all this the old christian virtue of humility of knowing the distance between our own knowledge and way of life and the fullness of experience of unity in faith among christians and to greater understanding with those who come from non christian religious traditions
2571022 the overemphasis on the private sphere creates a feeling of meaninglessness and the contrast between a persons assumed freedom from social responsibility and the actual harm done to others through the use of such freedom compels society to restrict it only the development of a sense of community of mutual respect and concern can lead us beyond such dilemmas the increase of interdependence in our human life together bring with it increasing pressures and the more unbearable these pressures become the more necessary it is to find solutions in the sense of the formation of a community that can deal with these problems
2571023 it is all too easy to imagine misjudgements on either side leading to a real war
2571024 western countries and ukraine have supplied georgia with an arsenal of heavy weaponry
2571025 using satellite technology the producers have created interactive dynamic maps of the countrys modern migrations everything from watching a sped up version of the hundreds of ships that pass through the english channel each day to tracking the routes of london taxis through gps signals the resulting dance around one another off crowded thoroughfares is fascinating to watch

2571106 a night that may be the most significant in modern chinese history
2571107 it doesnt matter how many big events ive been to this is the biggest
2571108 dedicated in loving memory to a friend a colleague and inspiration
2571109 seven years ago july 2001 in moscow the international olympic committee chose beijing to host these games in tiananmen square hundreds of thousands celebrated
2571110 for china the successful olympic bid was a validation of its hard fought reawakening after the painful memories of foreign occupation the cultural revolution the years of isolation
2571111 in one sense this night is the culmination of events set in motion by another sports story the surprising decision of mao zedong in 1971 to invite the american table tennis team to beijing
2571112 but culturally and especially politically china and the west have an uneasy relationship
2571113 shortly thereafter in mid may an even greater blow the cataclysmic earthquake that struck the sichuan province killed an estimated 70 000 and created five million homeless
2571114 but where hundreds of millions now experience modern prosperity its a country where the few rule the many where protest is not welcome a country that still cant shake the echoes of the 1989 tiananmen crackdown it is a country racing into the future confident it can claim its place on its own terms it has been a long long march to august 8 2008 to this moment when a historically insular civilization has invited the world to global event of epic proportions a long march to a night that may be the most significant in modern chinese history
2571115 this is zhang yimou creating a cinematic blockbuster on the floor of a stadium
2571116 this is one of those moments when we have to stop and ooh and ah
2571117 president bush still talking to vladimir putin perhaps talking about that opening drum number still
2571118 the chinese reaching their hands out to the world in an unprecedented way
2571119 what a meaningful choice by the u s delegation here in china
2571120 so many athletes will not make it to the olympic medal stand this is their olympic games
2571121 this will bring up a lot of hope for the future
2571122 all music all blogs thanks allmusic all blogs hiya great blog your stuff is top class man i have added you to my extensive link list at
2571123 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2571124 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2571125 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2571126 one minute youre in a quarterback battle and the next minute its completely different there are two ways to look at this you can get down about it or turn it into a positive i get to pick the brain of a future hall of famer that chance doesnt come along too often
2571127 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2571128 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year
2571129 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me

2571132 theres nothing more to be done but get this offense down get acclimated to the guys and the system

2571134 its the first time ive put on the pads since the giants game
2571135 well cater the program and the learning and hes been working incredibly hard he quarterbacks coach brian daboll and offensive coordinator brian schottenheimer have already spent a lot of time together well take it in chunks
2571136 theres been a lot of ups and downs not only the last couple weeks but the last couple months i think everyone was ready to get on with football
2571137 that goes without saying but they were the same in green bay i like the guys here i like the coaches i like erics approach its an easy going approach
2571138 this is the tough part for me its only going to get tougher because im behind

2571140 lance felt that kate came on too strong too fast
2571141 she started talking about marriage and babies almost right away
2571142 lance realized he wasnt so committed to the relationship and shouldnt pursue it any more he freaked out at her clinginess and bailed
2571143 marks injury is not as bad as a lot of people feared it was so well take the reps until he gets back and well see what happens then
2571144 im happy for mark that the injury is not as serious as it could have been
2571145 but my thinking hasnt changed at all im still going to compete for first team reps
2571146 its the same kind of opportunity just shortened a little i guess
2571147 im hoping mine will be like all the shorter ones i heard
2571148 i woke up and thought i was in a bad dream
2571149 i was like no and then it all sunk back in and i was like man but it could be a lot worse i should be thankful
2571150 i think the most difficult part of the last 24 hours is coming to the realization that youre no longer wanted by the organization pennington said
2571151 youve been there eight years and in a blink of the eye youre not wanted but i have an inner peace about it i feel good about how i was playing and conducting myself
2571152 i dont have any hard feelings the great part about being a fan is you can have an opinion as many negative opinion s that were out there ive received double or triple the positive i dont have any hard feelings towards anyone

2571155 terwijl het vuurwerk tijdens de openingsceremonie de lucht boven peking verlichtte gingen in diverse steden in georgi bommen en explosieven af we roepen de internationale gemeenschap op om rusland duidelijk te maken dat het invallen van een onafhankelijke staat in de 21e eeuw niet meer getolereerd kan worden
2571156 we hopen dat de duiven die vrijdag in het vogelnest werden losgelaten hun weg vinden naar de kaukasus en de vrede in het gebied herstellen
2571157 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia
2571158 the government of georgia has called for a cease fire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course it has chosen we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation finally the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2571159 if you want people to listen talk to them in their own language if you want them to act on that information expect actions that fall within or close to their current set of actions or the actions normal to that culture

2571172 it is despicable that this administration will send our brave troops all over the world to fight in foreign lands but will not help with the defense of a state that has contributed all of its national guard troops to the war on terror
2571173 even now more russian troops are parachuting in after being dropped by airplanes based in cuba i call on the united states congress to declare war on russia over this georgia invasion

2571182 you cant blame a criminal for committing more crimes after being given a free pass but you can blame suttons win at all costs arrogance and despicable judgment for totally destroying the lives of two heroic border agents for doing their jobs
2571183 there is no question the fallout from suttons prosecutorial overreach in the ramos and compean case has already caused immeasurable harm to the efforts and morale of the men and women of not only the border patrol but all law enforcement

2571198 as it dropped off the bridge rail the bus rolled to the right where it came to rest
2571199 certain irregularities about whether the bus was operating under the name angel tours or iguala busmex it is important to note that neither of these domestic entities is authorized to operate as a u s passenger carrier in interstate commerce at this time
2571200 as being a high risk carrier due to safety violations detected during roadside safety inspections and was subjected to an fmcsa compliance review in may 2008
2571201 this review resulted in fmcsa placing angel tours operations out of service
2571202 to date angel tours has not provided the agency with evidence of satisfactory corrective actions to the problems discovered and remains out of service
2571203 fmcsa has not granted iguala busmex authority to transport passengers because it has failed to fully comply with federal safety requirements
2571204 and as soon as we passed dallas we were on the two way freeway and i feel the bus ride a little bit fast and i have a feeling not a safe feeling

2571212 green investing is emerging as the new theme for the region
2571213 it is not hard to discover why the recent world wealth report by merrill lynch estimated that about 20 per cent of wealthy investors in the middle east had already allocated part of their portfolios to green technologies and alternative energy the highest proportion of any region in the world
2571214 private equity and venture capital is clearly becoming increasingly important in the process of diversification away from oil and gas
2571215 the wealth report also found that while half of those in the west who had invested in green technologies had done so out of a sense of social responsibility in the middle east two thirds said it was because of the potential high returns regional investors have identified a new source of income

2571225 lockwood smith is a different beast the eternal boy scout was admitting a truth when he said that politicians only do what public opinion allows them i was quite touched by that perception the lockie i knew would have said that public opinion was just the fickle fart of the multitude
2571226 while nick smith had his antennae on even despite the pinot and the pep talks nick knows that no young nat was ever cool primarily because people like him and me had been young nats and we were as cool as a barry manilow bender

2571400 in the final analysis brian said i made a commitment to the padres three years ago that i would like to fulfill
2571401 we thoroughly discussed and analyzed and projected the next two or three years of his career
2571402 and took in every consideration and he made the decision that he made he has never made a decision based on what was best for him moneywise he took a deal from the padres that was 6 million to 9 million less than what he could have gotten elsewhere the money factor had very little to do with his decision

2571418 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2571419 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2571420 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2571421 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2571422 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2571423 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2571424 when i played with lizette and i came back i still had kind of the same feeling as when i was up just because i had the momentum going
2571425 i was hitting it well it definitely helps though just to get out early and for me i almost can get even more into my own game and forget about who im playing with and just see how low i can go
2571426 i was just trying to do my best with pars but she played really really well i think she was four under or something shes just an awesome player and i wish her good luck
2571427 the only difference is i knew every girl i played last year either from the college level or junior golf and this year ive never played with any except for lizette i played a little bit of college golf with her but the last few opponents ive played during the tournament ive never played before its a little different in that aspect
2571428 i just was playing well and just wanted to keep the momentum going
2571429 it seems i have a pattern if i take a long break the next time i play very well
2571430 my dad gave me a stat that ive won the majority of tournaments after an extended break from college we get all of november until the end of february off and ive done well on our first spring tournament and its been consistent like that even through junior golf when i do take a long break i feel so much more refreshed and really excited to play the next tournament
2571431 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2571432 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2571450 ringrazio lassessore di queste belle parole ma io non ho scritto assolutamente niente di gallura il pubblico ride e non una dimenticanza ma una scelta ponderata perch scrivendo di sardegna insolita lultimo posto di cui si possa finire a parlare della gallura la regione pi nota fotografata e visitata dellisola in realt il libro nasce proprio con questo intento bla bla etc
2571451 massimetti basta vergognati signora ci scusi non siamo tutti cos
2571452 i dont think that dissolving parliament would be the best option for him no one in the country would support the action
2571453 he is left with two options either to face the impeachment motion like a man or resign and go home quietly
2571454 our request for the convening of the national assembly session on monday has been accepted and in this session we will be moving a resolution to start the impeachment process
2571455 there are around 16 to 17 pml q members in the national assembly who will vote against the president
2571456 around seven to eight will be such people in the senate
2571457 we have unrealistic expectations for people john edwards like the rest of us is only human
2571458 the truth is a lot of ordinary average americans have affairs
2571459 weve got one of the ablest candidates ever nominated and hes running against a man who really pretty much promises more of the same of what weve had the last eight years
2571460 i think its entirely up to senator edwards and his wife and the rest of us should keep quiet
2571461 the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2571462 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2571463 many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention
2571464 obviously a lot of people believed in john edwards people were passionate about his candidacy i think there are people who feel let down when you invest that much time and energy in a candidate and the candidate turns out to be less than you thought
2571465 the american public has become sensitised to this type of behaviour from political leaders
2571466 tu aurais pu terminer premi re en terminant cette place tu d grades ma notori t de toute fa on tu nes bonne rien et tu ne fera jamais rien de tes dix doigts

2571471 empec a festejar porque estaba segura de que el tanto era m o pero la gente comenz a abuchear y vi que los rbitros se paraban me puse muy nerviosa porque en el marcador se lo hab an dado a ella hubiese sido muy triste que me sacaran la lucha de esa manera
2571472 esta victoria tambi n es de mi entrenador fernando yuma y de todos los chicos que entrenan conmigo en estudiantes de la plata porque el judo no se puede hacer sin otro que ponga el cuerpo y se preste
2571473 we are a very small group and even a lot of people in the federal government dont know that we exist
2571474 each analyst for lack of a better term has a shoe box with their knowledge
2571475 they maintained it in a shared drive or a word document but were encouraging them to move those platforms so that everyone can benefit
2571476 but everything we do with the government is the same as what we do with our corporate customers

2571478 la famille edwards a indiqu quelle ne participerait probablement pas la convention d mocrate
2571479 cest une p riode difficile et p nible pour eux et je pense quils doivent travailler au processus de cicatrisation
2571480 nous avons des attentes irr alistes envers les gens la v rit cest que john edwards comme nous tous est humain

2571499 i honestly think anyone making the cut right now has still got a chance
2571500 those going out in the morning with the better greens can post a number and there is no reason why they cant get close to the lead
2571501 i was close to the cut at the open and finished tied for seventh i dont see why you cant do the same here
2571502 the guys at the top know how tough it can be and while they have played great golf to get there they need to play well to stay at the top

2571505 to let the rest of my life begin as soon as possible
2571506 no one is coming to save us from this challenge
2571507 there will be no government program it is our responsibility
2571508 young people who grow up without spending time in nature will be less champions about saving the environment or making budget decisions to save forests and wetlands
2571509 if you have not been in a forest or waded in a stream or not seen an elk migrate visited a farm or gotten your hands dirty working in a garden you will not know the value of open space
2571510 he thinks its some kind of game for him im very angry with him ive had a partnership with black hat for three years
2571511 the design of the network was to isolate it from the rest of the public network its not designed to isolate it from one computer in the press room to another computer in the press room
2571512 there are lots of notices that the wi fi network is a hostile network and is actively being monitored
2571513 people are aware that its going on the important distinction is what the expectations are in the media room
2571514 they take care of our soldiers now and im so glad
2571515 they called me to take care of him and we got married
2571516 my mother keeps on telling me im really glad i lived in the time i did
2571517 political discourse is now a formulaic matter of preaching to ones own choir and demonizing the opposition everythings relentlessly black and whitened since the truth is way way more gray and complicated than any one ideology can capture the whole thing seems to me not just stupid but stupefying
2571518 it is when one feels most strong most personally that its most tempting to speak up but its also when its the least productive or at any rate it seems that way plenty of writers and journalists are
2571519 it is you the vice president of our country who is despicable with your artificial heart your rictus face and your friends mean and evil
2571520 we were a generous people and kept our hearts open

2571541 to say it in more explicit terms than microsoft would use if you can write a document using a free service like www writely com and share it with distant collaborators will you still need microsoft word hotmail or sharepoint a microsoft software particularly aimed at cooperative work in a group
2571542 personally i believe its in appropriate to use this term
2571543 they are about passion they are willing to open up an show themselves they dont hide behind facts or memos
2571544 i didnt follow your advice but i remembered what you said you said sometimes you cant be afraid you just have to jump

2571576 there are competing visions of how the communion should responsibly handle our current situation
2571577 the 12 000 plus that are slated to attend the fight in lesnars present hometown will definitely be pro brock which cant hurt a thing as it relates to lesnars chances of not going 0 2 in the ufc lesnar can easily morph into a beast and a rah rah college like atmosphere may facilitate that transformation which some might consider to be costly for brock if he takes any unnecessary chances or tries to accomplish too much too fast being a lesnar fan i have plenty of concerns regarding this fight but i do think he will win and demonstrate how much his technique has improved since his debut its really hard to see this fight going to the judges

2571655 a recent study by bain amp company found that only 22 percent of the worlds major firms achieved real sustainable growth of even 5 percent a year over the ten year period from 1994 to 2004
2571656 many critics dont understand how the process of selling actually works sales people spend a huge amount of their time just looking for the right people to contact surveys of our 100k members show that the average time spent doing this is 33 sales people must call and crawl all over a target organization and waste the time of many innocent bystanders who are not the right people this process sucks for everyone involved

2571675 they regarded the cucumber as male and tomato as female women were not allowed to buy cucumbers only men

2571677 judgment might be wrong the only thing worse than an ineffective laughing stock of a government agency is allowing someone to make a decision without going through a bunch of committees none of us is as dumb as all of us

2571685 the best thing you can do painting is usually the best return on your investment new fixtures ceiling fans updated lighting and even ensuring that every door opens and closes can be very important too in michigan you have to make your house stand out
2571686 if we take good care of our staff they in turn take good care of our customers
2571687 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry in the russian arsenal they have launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2571688 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2571689 if the russian side is simply convinced it wants to keep pressing the attack militarily there is not much the georgians can do theyre being hit very hard so we have to rely on diplomacy
2571690 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2571691 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2571692 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2571693 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2571694 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2571695 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2571696 ah how good it would have been if it were otherwise if it had been like this or like that
2571697 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2571698 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2571699 i think the authorities are going to have to get a better handle on what the motivation was
2571700 when im at the tourist sites ill be with a group which will make it less likely for an incident the one thing that will change is i will definitely be more aware of my surroundings
2571701 winning the host rights means winning the respect trust and favor of the international community
2571702 another milestone in chinas rising international status and a historical event in the great renaissance of the chinese nation
2571703 by allowing beijing to host the games you will help the development of human rights
2571704 we are taking the bet that seven years from now we shall see many changes
2571705 getting on the ballot is just the first victory for our campaign
2571706 i am even more convinced now than i was a year ago that the people of san francisco are ready to lead the way to step outside of the dated two party system and elect someone who truly represents san francisco values not party loyalties and criminal activities
2571707 fonoiu m duce mereu la film i mi cump r pr jituri aproape mereu mi se face r u de la ele i vomit acas
2571708 we are blessed with vocations and their educational backgrounds and interests are important to us we dont take them to turn them into a standard dominican product but there is a strong dominican formation and that is a strong intellectual formation
2571709 but of course because truth is one there will be a common core of understanding and an appreciation of the economy of salvation in the catholic church
2571710 we were founded to combat against the albigensian heresy an essentially dualist heresy which separated the body from the soul our contemporary world suffers from a similar sort of sense of separation and the dominican way of life which offers a coherent whole has never been more necessary
2571711 we are a hinge between the apostolic tradition and the monastic tradition because we live together pray together but also go out and preach the truth of the gospel
2571712 because people deserve to have sense made or to be helped to make sense themselves of the faith that has been revealed to us
2571713 people deserve to hear a good sermon for that to be done it doesnt just take pastoral experience it means hard thinking hard studying about theology to think well about theology requires the study of philosophy as well
2571714 as dominicans we have a passion for truth but that has got to involve learning that things are often more complicated than we think and as a kind of fundamental dominican asceticism which is detachment from that which isnt wholly true actually surrendering some of our prejudices our half truths the shorthand we often live by we have to be prepared to give that up and focus on the truth of what god has revealed and thinking hard about it really
2571715 theres a kind of sympathetic hearing which then has to lead to critical reflection its not saying everythings true when patently some things are not but it serves to work out what the truth is
2571716 if you look at st thomass summa he is very much interested in the objections that are going to be put forward its allowing the objections to sharpen up ones sense of what the correct answer is
2571717 the ideal thing about the order was the balance between the contemplative and the active because id approached catholicism through the monastic lens that sort of thing seemed very attractive to me yet i recognised that i have that sort of extrovert side that i would really want to go out and do something with that contemplation
2571718 we all should be looking forward to the challenges going into a place like that takes you out of your comfort zone but thats exactly what we are supposed to do i really feel that we wouldnt be effective in our preaching mission if we didnt do that
2571719 to help them see the connection between their studies and pastoral care that the studies are not just for an academic purpose but that they are preparing them for the mission the way we do it always requires study because its a preaching and a theological mission wherever we do it
2571720 we can preach a message there that there is a way forward through christ and we give them as much help as we can if its one to one catechesis thats required or something like that or just to generally talk about faith
2571721 to the detriment of other areas of our ministry in the united kingdom
2571722 were not party to this correspondence at all we dont comment on leaked letters but its obvious that the congregation has been misinformed
2571723 the holy see would be deeply grateful to the authorities at the university of oxford were they to assist in these latter stages of the investigation by postponing the arrangement whereby the licence for greyfriars is to be returned to oxford university imminently
2571724 championing the request of the fellows and lecturers that other alternatives be examined prior to implementing fr james bonors decision to close greyfriars the fellows and lecturers hope that these discussions in rome will prove fruitful for the future of greyfriars oxford
2571725 the order is not in a position to cede to the request of the fellows the university made it perfectly clear that the licence was not transferable there was nothing else that we could do the fellows couldnt preserve greyfriars hall but they are perfectly at liberty to set up a new college
2571726 for all intents and purposes the licence has been surrendered
2571727 the lmss aim is to ensure that the extraordinary form of the roman rite is freely available in all the dioceses
2571728 we will liaise closely with the bishops and seminary rectors to ensure that all who wish to learn and worship in the traditional rite are able to do so
2571729 one of the most enjoyable weeks in my 24 years of priesthood
2571730 warm humorous inspiring and most significantly a genuine positive generous affirmation of all that the conference was trying to achieve
2571731 what i think bishop mcmahons heartwarming speech did most of all was to convey to those gathered that he was not simply there as a token prelate but that he really enjoyed taking part actively that he supported our work and that he was prepared to crack some jokes that he knew we would enjoy being entirely on our wavelength and as they say reading from the same page
2571732 bishop mcmahon has certainly won the hearts of the priests who came to merton all of a sudden there is someone that many priests loyal to pope benedict will be watching closely and including in their mementos at the mass
2571733 the beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you
2571734 he can be pragmatic but on the biggest decisions he tends to favour his instinct for the bigger picture
2571735 it is obvious that there has been a strong swing against the government
2571736 i have listened to that swing i will listen to what territorians said i take responsibility for the campaign
2571737 i believe in the principles that sit behind this side of politics
2571738 we rest on principles good principles and those principles when followed through can and will make a huge difference
2571739 we care enough to take a tough position on many issues its a tough road to hoe
2571740 it will be a great thing for the city for the community for tourism for economic development
2571741 it will really boost education and the economy in the state of mississippi

2571847 if a service gets smarter and richer as its audience increases and if audience input and existing services are the main production costs then it can serve the majority through many minor markets and can be called by the label web 2 0
2571848 its not the software that enables the web that matters so much as the services that are delivered over the web

2572334 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2572335 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2572336 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace
2572337 the georgian administration has found the use to its arms which they have been purchasing during the recent several years
2572338 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened fire on their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
2572339 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legally binding document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
2572340 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a document because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
2572341 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2572342 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it

2572350 thats one of the reasons the doctor eh the dollar is starting to fall right now
2572351 were talking about it now it will be the decision of the president of the country mikheil saakashvili
2572352 this training is incredibly important for us because we want to take back georgias lost territories
2572353 the officials said the freeze was partially intended to give israel leverage with moscow in its attempts to persuade russia not to ship arms and equipment to iran
2572354 they spoke on condition of anonymity as israel does not officially publish details of its arms sales
2572355 his main message was that the stock market is safe and there will be no bond defaults hes really great with investors really great at reassuring us
2572356 the prime minister has held throughout the day calls with investors and rating agencies and remains in touch with the investor community
2572357 todays events and their consequences are further deteriorating investor sentiment towards russian assets
2572358 last weeks attack on mechels pricing behaviour by putin and the lasting tnk bp nyse bp news people saga found a bloody next act in a screenplay that could be named how to destroy the investment story of one of the strongest credits in the emerging markets universe
2572359 georgia is very interested in western investment and the prime minister in particular is very concerned about what investors think if anything russia seems anti that approach
2572360 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2572361 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2572362 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2572363 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2572364 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2572365 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2572366 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2572367 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2572368 that peacekeeping troops in south ossetia are only from russia is simply a farce
2572369 we are not planning to send any troops there but anything is possible
2572370 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it

2572373 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
2572374 a means of restricting access to objects based on the sensitivity as represented by a label of the information contained in the objects and the formal authorization i e clearance of subjects to access information of such sensitivity
2572375 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
2572376 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
2572377 from a legal point of view russias actions in south ossetia are totally legitimate
2572378 we urge the georgian authorities to immediately stop their aggression against south ossetia to stop all violations of all standing agreements on a ceasefire and to respect the legal rights and interests of other people
2572379 we need an immediate ceasefire we will call both sides to exercise restraint
2572380 an act of aggression that is incompatible with international law and fundamental principles of security and cooperation in europe
2572381 this clearly shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets in georgia
2572382 the russian president has specifically stressed that the only way out from the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone
2572383 hes a team player he knows he needs to improve and thats the fastest way to improve
2572384 we feel very comfortable with our running game but we just wanted to get our pass game off to a fresh start
2572385 i feel good i felt real comfortable its preseason im not doing a lot but i still felt comfortable out there
2572386 the offensive line did a great job protecting today i really didnt get touched all day im just very confident knowing its going to be like that

2572390 obviously it turns a defining element of his biography his reputation as a devoted family man upside down
2572391 but if he shows a continued commitment to his core issues and no additional facts emerge that contradict his story he could eventually join the disturbingly large club of public figures whove rebounded from similar events

2572457 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2572458 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2572459 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2572460 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2572461 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2572462 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2572463 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2572464 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2572465 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2572466 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2572467 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2572468 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2572469 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2572470 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2572471 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2572472 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2572473 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2572474 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2572475 who are open to doing something on the production side
2572476 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2572477 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2572478 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2572479 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2572480 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2572481 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2572482 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2572483 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2572484 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2572485 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2572486 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2572487 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2572488 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2572489 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2572490 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2572491 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2572492 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2572493 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2572494 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2572495 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2572496 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2572497 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2572498 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2572499 the idea behind follow the wolves comes from a thought i had about being
2572500 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2572501 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2572502 its kind of disappointing when you talk it up and talk it up and then nothing happens
2572503 the houston area got most of the rain today two to four inches
2572504 with instability caused by the low pressure we could still see a 50 percent chance of rainfall throughout the day
2572505 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2572506 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2572507 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2572508 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2572509 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2572510 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2572511 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2572512 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2572513 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2572514 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2572515 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2572516 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2572517 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2572518 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2572519 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2572520 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2572521 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2572522 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2572523 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2572524 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2572525 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2572526 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2572527 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2572528 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2572529 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2572530 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2572531 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2572532 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2572533 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2572534 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2572535 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2572536 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2572537 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2572538 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2572539 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2572540 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2572541 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2572542 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2572543 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2572544 wenn ich an ihn glaube und es ihn gibt dann bin ich errettet wenn ich an ihn glaube und es ihn nicht gibt dann habe ich immerhin nichts verloren
2572545 my sheep hear my voice and follow me another they will not hear
2572546 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2572547 nobody ever will defy russian rule in this part of the world
2572548 an immediate cessation of hostilities the full respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia and the re establishment of the situation that existed before
2572549 this is a 100 percent unprovoked brutal russian invasion and aggression into a sovereign country
2572550 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely well founded and legitimate and moreover necessary
2572551 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2572552 all the georgian guys will be leaving for the homeland
2572553 toward that end and hopefully as a prelude to meaningful discussions between us i propose that members of our respective staffs meet as early as next week to re commence discussing possibilities for reaching an accommodation between the branches in this matter
2572554 given the lateness in the congress i do not believe a stay of judge bates order is necessary or appropriate
2572555 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
2572556 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
2572557 the aspect of this lawsuit that is unprecedented is the notion that ms miers is absolutely immune from compelled congressional process the supreme court has reserved absolute immunity for very narrow circumstances involving the presidents personal exposure to suits for money damages based on his official conduct or concerning matters of national security or foreign affairs the executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law
2572558 a limited number of u s attorneys could be targeted for removal and replacement
2572559 i had many chances but many putts stopped just short of the cup
2572560 on some holes you feel it more than others on the 18th they did the wave
2572561 its going to be very special but im not going to prepare in a different way
2572562 im going to have dinner at home with my parents
2572563 he is a normal person and has never been spoken to about anything like this before
2572564 maybe the police in chile have got the wrong person
2572565 i spoke to his fiancee lorena and she is obviously concerned and upset
2572566 if thats the case youll be my first speed bump
2572567 landslides have hit many areas but flash floods have caused the largest number of deaths
2572568 at least 800 houses have been destroyed or damaged we are still trying to get in touch with local authorities to help the people there rescue efforts are ongoing but they are being slowed by the severe weather

2572571 mr heath ledger died as the result of acute intoxication by the combined effects of oxycodone hydrocodone diazepam temazepam alprazolam and doxylamine
2572572 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2572573 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2572574 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2572575 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2572576 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2572577 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2572578 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2572579 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2572580 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2572581 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2572582 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2572583 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2572584 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2572585 in the middle of the night they would make you kneel and tell you what to do
2572586 i like to see the country get better and stronger

2572589 the olympics will push the chinese government to the next level
2572590 china has become more respected in the world economy we feel proud
2572591 things are much better than 20 years ago the difference today is like day and night with the 60s
2572592 maintained rapid economic growth dramatically improved living standards stabilized society in china and improved chinas international standing
2572593 corruption failed social policies on healthcare education environment and so on
2572594 could make it harder for the chinese government to be blatantly dictatorial in its handling of domestic affairs
2572595 this certainly helps to foster a diverse information environment in china
2572596 when i first immigrated here i thought why are they always bashing my country
2572597 it was a call not to end the olympics but to end the abuses
2572598 its a place to travel i love my hometown the place where i live is a very good place
2572599 we lived a very simple life and now i think its current

2572602 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2572603 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2572604 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2572605 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2572606 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2572607 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2572608 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2572609 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2572610 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2572611 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2572612 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2572613 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2572614 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2572615 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2572616 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2572617 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

2572621 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2572622 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2572623 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2572624 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2572625 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2572626 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2572627 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2572628 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2572629 it takes no belief to begin to live this way only the smallest space in which possibility can develop
2572630 abby im really glad you stopped by today its just about the worst day ive ever had
2572631 it is our inescapable duty to use wendell berrys words to change not only our light bulbs but our myths and along with them our concepts of entrepreneurship investing and philanthropy which will have to be amended expanded and perhaps even radically transformed as part of a new vision of restorative economics
2572632 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2572633 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2572634 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2572635 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2572636 you dont want to do what you think you want to do you really want to do what we think you want to do

2572643 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2572644 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2572645 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2572646 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2572647 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2572648 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2572649 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2572650 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2572651 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2572652 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2572653 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2572654 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2572655 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2572656 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2572657 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2572658 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2572659 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2572660 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2572661 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2572662 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2572663 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2572664 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2572665 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2572666 more tax deceptions mccain misrepresents obamas tax proposals again and again and again
2572667 hey dont worry dont be afraid ever because this is just a ride

2572675 we are unable to afford medication and medical fees we lost our other son due to extreme poverty for our daughters operation we collected the money we needed through donations
2572676 when i sought treatment for my son here i was told theres no treatment here only abroad
2572677 but its been one year since i applied to the unhcr to seek medical care abroad for him but ive had no reply
2572678 because he came here for this mission we can forgive him
2572679 i was in the marine corps for a very long time i was a military career man i had been in the marine corps for 10 years before the war in iraq and i did volunteer
2572680 when we left our commanders and leaders told us that we were going to help the iraqi people that was the very clear message and i believed in that message
2572681 when i discovered we were hurting more than we were helping i got out i left
2572682 we thank god that you came back safely from iraq
2572683 if this disaster was triggered by climbers being stranded above the bottleneck after a collapsing serac took out the fixed ropes then i cant think of a comparable death trap in mountaineering history
2572684 people at base camp saw me go over the wrong side of the ridge and they radioed people in camp iv i had to sit out a whiteout because i couldnt see anything and i knew i couldnt go down any further so i waited for a few hours and then i saw through the clouds that i could go down on an easier glacier
2572685 if we want to save our planet earth to save life to save mankind we have a duty to put an end to the capitalist system
2572686 unbridled industrial development extraction of natural resources excessive consumption of goods and accumulation of waste
2572687 more conveniently he also demanded that trillions of dollars from the west be diverted to places like bolivia
2572688 the nations that have the best track records on environmental protection and improvement are those with the highest amount of free market capitalism
2572689 a friend of mine has made a youtube video about the murder of my 10 year old brother in jacksonville florida in 1968 glens death was not investigated in 1968 and still today there has been no justice for glen
2572690 every day is a struggle for me to get up in the morning to work to put a smile on my face when all i feel like doing is crying to the outside world i seem like a person who has it together but i am a complete mess inside
2572691 its hard for your opponent to say bad things about you when your fist is in his mouth
2572692 es dif cil imaginar c mo se puede convencer a osetia del sur de que siga unida a georgia
2572693 creo que est absolutamente claro que las aspiraciones de georgia a la hora de entrar en la otan est n dictadas por sus intentos de involucrar a otros pa ses en sus sangrientas aventuras
2572694 est obligada a proteger a los ciudadanos a trav s de su papel de pacificador
2572695 without heavy reinforcement from russia the general sense is that tskhinvali is not defensible
2572696 but i dont know whats going to happen afterwards ossetians are all armed and theyre going to fight back
2572697 we know this is not going to go easy the first couple of days
2572698 what is going on has nothing to do with the work you do
2572699 continue to do what you are doing so well for the community
2572700 i think everybody wants to work together and go through an amicable transition
2572701 it would suck if it wasnt an even year they woulndy have been able to do that
2572702 i am making sure all the patients are taken care of
2572703 we enjoyed it here we were very proud to be here in the virgin islands to help establish the charlotte kimelman cancer institute
2572704 were here to serve to do our best its been wonderful
2572705 its unfortunate right now that its been overclouded with the turn of events
2572706 it will always have a special place in our hearts
2572707 as of today no funds have been appropriated for the implementation of the sept 13 primary election
2572708 this modest increase would allow the system to address increased costs associated with the utility bills and provide a funding mechanism for the joint boards of elections
2572709 the requested changes in law are a very important part of the process
2572710 there are issues at the elections system of the virgin islands that need to be addressed very soon
2572711 psc does not have the power of general oversight over wapas actions
2572712 the significant fact that when the legislature created wapa it expressly provided wapa with its own governing board for its management
2572713 by doing so the legislature clearly intended that it be the responsibility of wapas board not psc to establish and implement wapas managerial decisions whilst subjecting wapas rates to pscs jurisdiction
2572714 can not assume control over wapa general managerial decisions by subjecting them to pscs prior review and approval
2572715 limiting effect on the commissions authority and ability to adequately regulate wapa
2572716 the residents of the territory are living under the strain of one of the highest utility costs in the nation
2572717 there again exists several ambiguities in the law that require immediate attention in order for the commission to continue to effectively regulate the franchisee and ensure the possibility of reliable and affordable inter island travel between st croix and st thomas
2572718 psc does not have the power of general oversight over wapas actions
2572719 the significant fact that when the legislature created wapa it expressly provided wapa with its own governing board for its management
2572720 by doing so the legislature clearly intended that it be the responsibility of wapas board not psc to establish and implement wapas managerial decisions whilst subjecting wapas rates to pscs jurisdiction
2572721 can not assume control over wapa general managerial decisions by subjecting them to pscs prior review and approval
2572722 limiting effect on the commissions authority and ability to adequately regulate wapa
2572723 the residents of the territory are living under the strain of one of the highest utility costs in the nation
2572724 there again exists several ambiguities in the law that require immediate attention in order for the commission to continue to effectively regulate the franchisee and ensure the possibility of reliable and affordable inter island travel between st croix and st thomas
2572725 jakby nie byla fajna to bym do niej nie lecial
2572726 until real funding is identified established and consistently maintained the inability to pay the normal annual cost of operations will continue to cause the unfunded liability to escalate
2572727 by not funding the plan on an actuarial reserve basis creates significant problems for the system
2572728 the system cannot survive another 10 years of escalating benefit expenditures without the respective concurrent incremental contributions increases or a significant cash infusion in the form of pension obligation bonds
2572729 we feel that the market will rebound in the near future
2572730 traditionally living people have not been featured but based on significance of the topic bvi post decided to seek permission through the foreign and commonwealth office
2572731 this is something historic for us these are stamps which you can purchase and have for years to come so your children and grandchildren can see the persons who have participated in the olympics
2572732 given those numbers in our view the unions are in a unique position to help us
2572733 until we have a better understanding its very difficult for us to make any choices
2572734 ive been to thirteen opening ceremonies and to me this has been the most spectacular
2572735 it was really fantastic and they had so many numbers of people that first opening scene as a spectator we figured there were hundreds of people out there with the drums and the lights we really enjoyed that there were just so many things that were fantastic
2572736 for two hours we were there in the heat and of course it went on til after 12 oclock
2572737 but it was a very spectacular opening ceremony and i think we are all going to look forward to some spectacular games the chinese did a great job in organizing
2572738 china used all its resources to show its history to demonstrate its capacity and its ability to use modern technology
2572739 it also included former olympians in its activities and i thought that was great it captivated the audience and except for the music which seemed to be a little disjointed it was a wonderful experience
2572740 if one doesnt understand the history and the culture it will be really difficult for one to make a comparison
2572741 but in terms of technology i think the chinese used technology to the max ive never seen anybody use technology as efficiently and as dramatically as the chinese
2572742 its part of our commitment to support airlines with flights to the virgin islands
2572743 the current status of the airline industry necessitated that we initiate new strategies and build on relationships that existed but required some dialogue in order for both parties to adjust to the current environment
2572744 im pleased with the efforts of the committee and the departments actions to have garnered a positive response from many of our airline partners
2572745 there has been no showing of any conditions that are stringent enough
2572746 we calculated the numbers and arrived at 3 2 million
2572747 i would hope when we proceed with this process we proceed with caution
2572748 our young men and women who voluntarily put themselves in harms way in the service to our country are indeed our greatest heroes
2572749 their service and their sacrifice are never to be forgotten or taken lightly
2572750 all of the dinners were sold out and there was a waiting list for each dinner
2572751 all in all the 2008 winemakers dinners grossed 140 000 for the bvi charitable fund
2572752 it is a popular sport no doubt about that especially in south asia but the world governing body of cricket the icc has never approached us for any membership nor do they seem interested in doing so in the near future
2572753 there is no doubt that in some cases athletes dont have much education about the banned substances but at the ioc we have a very strict policy on this and expect our member countries to follow suit
2572754 it aint he over there in beijing what foolishness he asking
2572755 the fact that we protestant leaders are invited to the opening ceremony means that christianity is now more integrated into the society and the government respects religions and society accepts us
2572756 the spirit of the olympics is to promote peace and friendship through sports contests and we pastors are obliged to participate in the games
2572757 we published a special edition of the bible as a blessing for the beijing olympics
2572758 underground church clergy who work near beijing have faced restrictions on their work in the run up to the beijing 2008 olympic games
2572759 quite a number of bishops and priests near beijing and not affiliated with the government sanctioned open church have been forbidden to administer sacraments or do pastoral work since late july
2572760 the best olympics arena is not at the stadiums but at the mindset of chinese people to respect different cultural values and to share the responsibility of global citizenship
2572761 allowing and or encouraging people to inject heroin into their veins is not harm reduction it is the opposite we believe it is a form of harm addition
2572762 casi analoghi dice lorenzo croce presidente nazionale dallaidaa sono accaduti in passato anche a milano a parma e nelle marche come aidaa sono ormai quattro anni che ci impegniamo nella lotta contro la sparizione di mici dal manto nero e anche in questo caso ci pare di poter dire che dietro queste sparizioni ci siano dei sadici maniaci o degli esoterici
2572763 daniel yes we had a great time in el puerto as we knew we would we have been 4 times now we enjoyed staying in an old part of town but the flat has a very contemporary design inside which was a nice surprise we thought it would be noisy in the centre of town but in fact it was very quiet although she does not speak english chari was very welcoming and friendly just one suggestion for uk visitors we do like our tea so an electric kettle is a good thing to put in the flat very best wishes mark amp jayne ps well done espana for euro 2008 the best team won

2572774 the district the board the administration has wasted far too much time and too much money on this hearing and i think we need to move forward and keep in mind our purpose to restore academic excellence to our district and our students
2572775 we allowed them to continue until late in the evening midnight at the latest
2572776 they left us with little choice weve directed them to get their work in line with approved plans
2572777 we didnt want to do this construction and tear up the new streets
2572778 were going to make sure for the future we dont have a collision like this again
2572779 centerpoint and downtown merchants both have jobs to do and they should find neutral ground and both work together
2572780 we gave the public an opportunity to select the qualities sought of the next superintendent
2572781 when you get older you start wanting to come home
2572782 my sister is a principal at dickinson and lives in league city this is an opportunity for us to come home and were excited about the possibility
2572783 hes a local guy whos coming back home he really wants to stay and raise his children you cant do better than that
2572784 one good insight with action is worth a thousand good ideas
2572785 a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
2572786 we received a call that someone was smelling fumes in the area and we investigated with the coast guard and found oil in the canal between the power plant and the barrier

2572801 rusia ha lanzado una invasi n militar a gran escala de georgia
2572802 la respuesta ha sido muy desproporcionada respecto de cualquier amenaza que rusia haya citado
2572803 estamos llamando a un inmediato cese al fuego y al retiro de todas las tropas
2572804 las acciones de rusia en osetia del sur son totalmente leg timas
2572805 instamos a las autoridades de georgia a que detengan de inmediato su agresi n contra osetia del sur para terminar con todas las violaciones de los acuerdos vigentes sobre tregua y para respetar los derechos legales y los intereses de otras personas
2572806 los ataques se dan en regiones de georgia que est n lejos de la zona de conflicto en osetia del sur marcan una escalada peligrosa en la crisis
2572807 que la nica soluci n a la tr gica crisis provocada por el gobierno georgiano es el retiro de tiflis de sus formaciones armadas desde la zona de conflicto
2572808 iii encuesta nacional del consumo de drogas en poblaci n general
2572809 los padres ignoran el da o f sico y psicol gico que hacen a sus ni os en muchos casos ellos vuelven a beber a escondidas de sus padres y entre bromas vuelven a repetirlo con sus amigos
2572810 esta campa a es muy importante porque seg n nuestros estudios los adolescentes y j venes son la poblaci n m s vulnerable y quienes presentan los mayores ndices de consumo problem tico de alcohol tabaco y marihuana por ello devida en el marco del convenio suscrito viene trabajando coordinadamente con el minsa para hacer frente a esta problem tica
2572811 la esposa los hijos y los hermanos de alguna manera tambi n est n afectados por el alcohol pues nadie puede vivir en permanente preocupaci n con la inseguridad econ mica y con el miedo de que el esposo o el hermano vuelva ebrio a casa

2572814 to hope this will just go away would be a grave error it would be very irresponsible to let this uncertainty go on
2572815 once the suggestion was made that the treasury was considering it the government had to clarify what was going on and the time scale for the review it had to set an early date for making it clear what it had in mind one way or another
2572816 since the treasury has raised the issue it should really follow through it should make a statement theres still an element of dithering
2572817 obesity several large studies using nationally representative samples suggest that the problem the united states might have as one of its causes a corresponding decrease in the average number of hours that people are sleeping the findings suggest that this might be happening because sleep deprivation could be disrupting hormones that regulate glucose metabolism and appetite the association between sleep deprivation and obesity appears to be strongest in young and middle age adults other scientists hold that the physical discomfort of obesity and related problems such as sleep apnea reduce an individuals chances of getting a good nights sleep
2572818 the new york times has not deigned to touch the story although it recently ran thousands of words on a relationship between mccain and a female lobbyist which appeared to be based more on innuendo than fact
2572819 escrib deliberadamente y conscientemente con respeto sobre el islam y mahoma
2572820 consejo cautelar no s lo de que la publicaci n de este libro podr a ser ofensiva para algunos miembros de la comunidad musulmana sino que tambi n podr a incitar actos de violencia por parte de un segmento peque o pero radical
2572821 tras una larga deliberaci n decidimos posponer la publicaci n por la seguridad del autor de los empleados de random house de libreros y de cualquier otra persona que estuviera involucrada con la distribuci n y seguridad de la novela
2572822 esta decisi n ha creado una gran pol mica en c rculos acad micos y en internet y lo han comparado con otros hechos similares en los que todo lo relacionado con el islam se est convirtiendo en tab por temor a represalias por parte de los musulmanes radicales
2572823 a positive discussion on race and accusing me of racism
2572824 the sad thing is that my comments have been taken so out of context
2572825 if you point to something that deals with race youre immediately a racist
2572826 i am sorry that there are people who think i am a racist
2572827 people who have to deal with black employees find this not to be true
2572828 my dad is not a racist man if he was he would have no hair hed have swastikas on his body and he would go around talking about hitler thats what a racist is to me
2572829 they should apologize to me for calling me a racist
2572830 made him a racist in the wake of the don imus scandal daniel engber introduced us to the man responsible for censoring inappropriate radio comments
2572831 the individual price for these cleaners is 15 each but for you as a special offer today i am offering them at 6 000 dollars for two chuckle just kidding for you today i am offering two for 20
2572832 i dont know if theres an environmental explanation for why my father was the way he was
2572833 for some reason he just took being a father really seriously
2572834 whats important to black men in a society that has a fair amount of racism is a notion of manhood
2572835 manhood is all they have and what that usually means in our culture is the ability to provide for your family financially
2572836 theres a host of evidence noting that men who cannot fulfill the breadwinner role often experience distress and interruptions in positive engagement in family life
2572837 its too time consuming to me it just wastes my time worrying about getting on time i hope you understand and you will find me in comments on other blogs i might be making some pictures every now and then but maybe not
2572838 he was absolutely marvellous so prepared so professional so enthusiastic
2572839 i didnt know jean lemire but the fact that it was a canadian piece swung me over to it
2572840 i looked at it and i really loved their work
2572841 they went through trauma and personal anguish and terrible terrible disappointment with what is happening with the world
2572842 oh i hope they get a devastating understanding of what terrible things that we are doing
2572843 just look at the wretched broadcasting in the united states during this presidential campaign its disgusting look what theyre feeding people
2572844 if barack obama is elected president then al gore will be the energy czar in the united states and that i do believe would have a very positive effect
2572845 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2572846 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2572847 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2572848 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2572849 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2572850 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2572851 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2572852 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2572853 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2572854 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2572855 the coup is a serious setback for mauritanians because it has robbed the people of their basic right to freely elect leaders of their own choice
2572856 we will not release the deposed president at the time being for security reasons we are now trying to make calm prevail
2572857 the first time he kissed her he should have been thinking goodbye to my political career
2572858 feel invulnerable that they feel it has gone on all of the time that im not going to be scrutinized at this level and it will stay private
2572859 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2572860 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2572861 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2572862 i dont know what causes one to cross a bright line like this one but its probably going to haunt him for the rest of his life its colossal
2572863 fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make
2572864 i liked him before but i dont see any integrity
2572865 the image of him and his wife was very important the image of that union
2572866 i have great things to say about john edwards he opened that window up for our rural community
2572867 it gave something to our community and our students and their families
2572868 i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it
2572869 whoever wins will face a big wake up call as soon as the election is over
2572870 there is no question that the proposals of either candidate would dramatically worsen the fiscal situation
2572871 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2572872 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2572873 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2572874 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2572875 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2572876 just so you all know we did set a record
2572877 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2572878 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2572879 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2572880 everybody says they want to support it but its been a tough sell
2572881 a number of utilities have reported that only 20 percent to 30 percent of their customers are aware that a green power option is offered
2572882 thats confusing they think its the wind why isnt it free
2572883 what we see in georgia is whats the minimum that we can do well take your money and well green wash and do a lot of propaganda about the program
2572884 10 years behind the curve southern co is looking at offshore wind but theyre not really advancing the ball on renewable energy in a credible or serious way
2572885 as much as 1 billion on renewable generation over the next 10 years
2572886 if they had something in place where they were doing wind turbines on the coast or solar modules or solar plants or something like that i would be more inclined to pay more for that
2572887 but its just really hard for me to justify paying more for landfill methane gas
2572888 consequence of economic growth and development untendered by adequate concern and conservation
2572889 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2572890 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2572891 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products

2572900 we dont know what will happen but were talking about it now it will be the decision of the president of the country mikheil saakashvili
2572901 this deliberate strategy of aggression has grown into a full scale military intervention involving all regions of georgia
2572902 georgia calls upon the international community to make it clear to russia that intrusion into and bombing of the territory of a sovereign state is unacceptable in the 21st century and that such acts cannot and will not be tolerated
2572903 we can only bring the ideal of how sport can bring people together it is a very complex issue and it is not for the ioc to give a perspective on what has been happening
2572904 it is not what the world wants to see it is contrary to what the olympic ideal stands for the sad reality is that there are a number of countries at the olympics that are in conflict
2572905 fomos notificados de que a r ssia planeja enviar elementos de sua frota do mar negro para a abkh zia ou mais precisamente para a ochamchira aparentemente para proteger seus civis

2572910 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2572911 a study 1975 1989 showed that portfolios that finished the first five years in the top quintile were actually the least likely to finish in the top half over the next five years
2572912 of the 50 top performing funds in 2000 not a single one appeard on the list in either 1999 or 1998
2572913 using past performance numbers as a method for choosing mutual funds is such a lousy idea that mutual fund companies are required by law to tell you it is a lousy idea
2572914 the enemy of a good plan is the search for a perfect plan
2572915 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2572916 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
2572917 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
2572918 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
2572919 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2572920 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2572921 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2572922 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2572923 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2572924 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2572925 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2572926 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2572927 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2572928 if every american were to pitch in 2 000 we could pay off this years deficit or if we handed over each of us 500 gallons of gasoline or in terms we could all really understand if every american gave up 666 lattes for a year we could pay off this years deficit
2572929 the people who can affect the price of oil would prefer a republican presidential candidate watch the price of oil if it goes down which it may very well it could help john mccain quite a bit
2572930 its not only obamas youth eloquence and energy that have stolen hearts across the atlantic obama has raised expectations of a chance for the nation to redeem itself in the role that europe has loved respected and relied upon
2572931 the 200 000 plus crowd confirmed his rock star status and his more cooperative sounding rhetoric was what the crowd wanted to hear
2572932 mr obamas weeklong tour of war zones and foreign capitals is noteworthy because it is so unusual to see a presidential candidate act so presidential overseas
2572933 sen obama is not just tacking gently toward the center hes lurching right when it suits him hes zigging with the kind of reckless abandon thats guaranteed to cause disillusion if not whiplash
2572934 however you feel about her politics i feel that received some of the most unfair hostile coverage ive ever seen
2572935 if theres anything we need to rescue us from the last eight years its brains good judgment and experience obama has the first two gore has all three
2572936 i have fundamental differences with on the issues and always have i dont have any problem criticizing john mccain
2572937 obama is something special a man who makes difficult tasks look easy who seems to touch millions of diverse people with a message of hope that somehow doesnt sound pollyannaish
2572938 ive been covering presidential campaigns since 1960 i have always said i have never seen the media as much entranced by a candidate than when they were in my very first campaign in 1960 when they were for jfk but im telling you right now the enchantment with obama beats the jfk syndrome
2572939 i knew ronald reagan ronald reagan was a friend of mine barack obama is no ronald reagan
2572940 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2572941 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2572942 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2572943 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2572944 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2572945 cultura cient fica no es compatible con la labor period stica
2572946 teniendo en cuenta las malas experiencias que hemos o do contar a los cient ficos sobre su relaci n con alg n periodista y dada la diferente mentalidad de ambas profesiones nos ha sorprendido mucho que la encuesta la m s grande hasta la fecha refleje unas relaciones tan fluidas mucho mejores de lo que cre amos
2572947 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2572948 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2572949 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2572950 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2572951 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2572952 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2572953 real results by the end of my first term in office
2572954 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2572955 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2572956 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2572957 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2572958 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2572959 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2572960 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2572961 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2572962 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2572963 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2572964 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2572965 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2572966 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2572967 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2572968 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2572969 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2572970 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2572971 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2572972 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2572973 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2572974 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2572975 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2572976 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2572977 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2572978 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2572979 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2572980 it predates me being involved in politics or him being involved in politics im older than him so i serve an older brother role i hope he feels ive been there for him and hes certainly been a very loyal and terrifically helpful colleague
2572981 one of the roles ive always wound up playing is being a translator telling people yes he has a different approach hes serious about change this is what it means and my relationship with him gives credibility to that
2572982 my dad is one of the people who taught me how to laugh

2572985 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2572986 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2572987 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2572988 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2572989 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2572990 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2572991 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2572992 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2572993 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2572994 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2572995 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees

2573000 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2573001 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2573002 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2573003 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2573004 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2573005 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
2573006 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2573007 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2573008 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both

2573010 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2573011 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2573012 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2573013 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2573014 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2573015 many of those offshore leases are deepwater potentially lucrative but expensive the shallower the lease the less costly the exploration there is another factor at work as well part of an oil companys worth is the reserves of oil it owns or leases so amassing lots of leases boosts its stock value it is always good to lease more
2573016 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2573017 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2573018 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2573019 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2573020 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2573021 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2573022 remember that natural gas pipeline the oil companies magically never seem to build to the north slope
2573023 and production would not be expected to start before 2017
2573024 saying that production wouldnt begin for 10 years democrats oppose offshore drilling just like they did 10 years ago
2573025 why the democrats cant make the oil companies the bad guys on this issue is beyond me
2573026 its a delicate balance and that balance is being skewed by the 24 7 world of internet and cable news faster faster is the mantra but we need to try our damndest to fact check on demand
2573027 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2573028 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2573029 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2573030 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2573031 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2573032 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2573033 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2573034 after others learn about this new group kaya natin we can hardworking and ethical local government officials will come out hopefully
2573035 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2573036 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2573037 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2573038 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2573039 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2573040 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2573041 it is our job to clarify any confusion and misunderstanding
2573042 whatever decisions orders and policies handed down by the courts and the legal department we have to abide by them they should understand the countrys legal system
2573043 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2573044 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2573045 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2573046 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2573047 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2573048 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2573049 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2573050 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2573051 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2573052 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2573053 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2573054 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2573055 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2573056 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2573057 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2573058 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2573059 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2573060 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2573061 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2573062 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2573063 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2573064 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2573065 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2573066 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2573067 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
2573068 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
2573069 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2573070 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2573071 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
2573072 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
2573073 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
2573074 right kind rooted in the real lives of real people
2573075 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2573076 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2573077 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2573078 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2573079 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
2573080 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
2573081 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
2573082 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2573083 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2573084 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2573085 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2573086 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2573087 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2573088 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2573089 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2573090 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2573091 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2573092 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2573093 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2573094 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2573095 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2573096 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2573097 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2573098 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2573099 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2573100 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2573101 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2573102 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
2573103 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
2573104 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2573105 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2573106 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2573107 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2573108 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2573109 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2573110 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2573111 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2573112 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2573113 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2573114 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2573115 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2573116 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
2573117 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
2573118 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2573119 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2573120 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2573121 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2573122 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2573123 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2573124 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2573125 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2573126 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2573127 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2573128 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2573129 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2573130 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2573131 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2573132 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2573133 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2573134 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2573135 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2573136 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2573137 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2573138 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2573139 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2573140 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2573141 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2573142 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2573143 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2573144 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2573145 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2573146 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2573147 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2573148 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2573149 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2573150 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2573151 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2573152 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2573153 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2573154 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2573155 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2573156 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2573157 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2573158 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2573159 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2573160 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2573161 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2573162 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2573163 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2573164 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2573165 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2573166 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2573167 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2573168 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2573169 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2573170 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2573171 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2573172 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2573173 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2573174 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2573175 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2573176 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2573177 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2573178 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2573179 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2573180 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2573181 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2573182 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
2573183 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
2573184 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
2573185 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
2573186 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
2573187 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
2573188 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2573189 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
2573190 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2573191 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
2573192 im filing a 10 million libel action and i dont think you want ap to be part of that
2573193 its a story of courage of a very brave service dog taking care of me he passed away i was so depressed i had him cloned
2573194 that i would ski naked down mount everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2573195 i have been played up as a very wicked and perverted woman
2573196 she is a person of note in our little community
2573197 48 ft tall tipping bucket douses nearly 1 000 gallons of water onto guests below every few minutes
2573198 im filing a 10 million libel action and i dont think you want ap to be part of that
2573199 its a story of courage of a very brave service dog taking care of me he passed away i was so depressed i had him cloned
2573200 that i would ski naked down mount everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2573201 i have been played up as a very wicked and perverted woman
2573202 she is a person of note in our little community
2573203 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
2573204 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
2573205 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
2573206 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
2573207 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
2573208 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
2573209 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
2573210 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
2573211 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
2573212 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
2573213 with cloud computer looming on the horizon it is important for us all to think of the privacy threats there as well
2573214 the tool resides with someone else and the data is stored somewhere else generally that is a bad idea
2573215 when information is in the public domain it is game over
2573216 information on your computer may get protection under the law but on someone elses it gets less protection
2573217 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and its going to get worse before it gets better
2573218 giving them our data is a clear and present risk
2573219 how hard would it be to target someone as a political activist or a person with aids
2573220 this is heresy but one day google will die what happens to data when a company dies is a big question
2573221 this is an important milestone that has been registered in the inter party dialogue
2573222 he is going to meet the three principals basically to update them on the progress made so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2573223 we are not yet sure how the meetings will go
2573224 there are things which were referred to the principals and need to be sorted out before president mbeki comes
2573225 the dialogue demonstrates that we share a common heritage and it is in our best interests to preserve that heritage and build on it
2573226 it is with this in mind that the on going dialogue between zanu pf and the two opposition mdc parties must be appreciated by every single zimbabwean
2573227 during the middle of a campaign youre always worried about taking some time off
2573228 i think there are a lot of democrats who are nervous
2573229 i think they thought this election would fall into their laps
2573230 an artificial expectation that he needs to be way ahead at this time
2573231 history is replete with northern liberals who end up losing
2573232 anybody gone into whole foods lately and see what they charge for arugula rocket
2573233 not long ago a couple of hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
2573234 i predict that will be translate into a vote for obama
2573235 i will be for change and ill bring you change
2573236 save someones life and you have a burden for life
2573237 it is extremely improbable that we will have the structure and financial ability to take on all the people who require art antiretroviral therapy and then treat them for life
2573238 if you add the current 35 billion that is being spent in the developed world youre talking at that time about annually needing almost 90 billion dollars in a continuous fashion
2573239 and that doesnt even take into account complications with secondary resistance to drugs and other issues
2573240 a kind of curious passivity among the international aids establishment
2573241 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognised my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2573242 i dont talk about these tabloids they re tabloid trash and just full of lies
2573243 i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2573244 once the three men were in the water there was very little chance they could get back on the boat
2573245 it would be beyond their reach in seconds from that point the end would have been swift
2573246 none of them was a good swimmer the seas were choppy they would have quickly become exhausted and sunk beneath the waves although i cant exclude the possibility of a shark attacking them drowning is a far more likely cause of death
2573247 my biggest fear was being attacked by somebody who did not want me on the boat i was 160km out to sea with no back up
2573248 i didnt know if someone was going to burst through a cupboard and go at me with a knife
2573249 zemeckis is going to make a christmas carol with jim carrey he wants me to play mr fezziwig
2573250 you stand in a box with that funny suit on and it reads everything you do am i going to do it of course i am
2573251 i dont think there is any question that the impeachment process is failing im quite positive he will resign before that

2573256 tactical battalions have completely liberated tskhinvali from georgian military forces
2573257 we are actually in the stage of preparing our departure
2573258 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2573259 we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august 6th
2573260 russia needs to support these efforts so that peace can be restored as quickly as possible
2573261 to urgently convene a meeting of the european council at the level of heads of government
2573262 russian military forces have gone through all the red lines by crossing an internationally recognised border into the sovereign territory of georgia
2573263 this is a clear act with visible elements of aggression and an outrageous violation of international law with grave consequences to regional and euro atlantic stability and security as well as to euro atlantic relations with russia
2573264 iran is ready to offer any help under its principal policies of contributing to the establishment of peace and stability in the region
2573265 a worsening of the crisis could affect the whole region with its negative consequences
2573266 for the first time weve built a sequence from ancient dna that is essentially without error
2573267 i have the desire to make him happy to calm him

2573270 the 12 000 plus that are slated to attend the fight in lesnars present hometown will definitely be pro brock which cant hurt a thing as it relates to lesnars chances of not going 0 2 in the ufc lesnar can easily morph into a beast and a rah rah college like atmosphere may facilitate that transformation which some might consider to be costly for brock if he takes any unnecessary chances or tries to accomplish too much too fast being a lesnar fan i have plenty of concerns regarding this fight but i do think he will win and demonstrate how much his technique has improved since his debut its really hard to see this fight going to the judges
2573271 friday might not have been the best day for some wrestlers to answer their cell phones or home phones or blackberrys or emails or even answer their front doors
2573272 great to hear that jonathan coachman has started his new gig for espn with his first assignment being on espn news i expect to see coachs career advance nicely on espn after he gets his feet wet reading the sports on espn news coachman can do play by play and has done college football along with mens and womens hoops which will help him move up specifically having experience broadcasting womens basketball is a nice caveat for the coach to have in his pocket

2573274 we note that the macbook has had the same design since its launch over two years ago and the macbook pro has had essentially the same design since its launch over 2 5 years ago which was very similar in design to the powerbook g4 released over 5 5 years ago
2573275 and not only while his love continues is he mischievous and unpleasant but when his love ceases he becomes a perfidious enemy of him on whom he showered his oaths and prayers and promises and yet could hardly prevail upon him to tolerate the tedium of his company even from motives of interest the time of payment arrives and now he is the servant of another master instead of love and infatuation wisdom and temperance are his bosoms lords the man has changed but the beloved is not aware of this he asks for a return and recalls to his recollection former acts and words for he fancies that he is talking to the same person and the other being ashamed and not having the courage to tell him that he has changed and not knowing how to make good his promises has now grown virtuous and temperate he does not want to do as he did or to be as he was before therefore he runs away and can but end a defaulter quick as the spinning of an oyster shell he changes pursuit into flight and the other is compelled to follow him with passion and imprecation not knowing that he ought never from the first to have accepted a demented lover instead of a sensible non lover and that in making such a choice he was yielding to a faithless morose envious disagreeable thing hurtful to his estate hurtful to his bodily constitution and still more hurtful to the cultivation of his mind which is and ever will be the most honorable possession both of gods and men consider this fair youth and know that in the friendship of the lover there is no real kindness he has an appetite and wants to feed upon you as woves love lambs so lovers love their loves

2573315 always been understood as an individual right and was at the forefront of peoples minds in 1789
2573316 the decision is a laboratory story of the misuse of judicial power to get an ideological outcome
2573317 violated the ancient rule that all words are meaningful this is ideology talking not the constitution
2573318 t here is simply no avoiding the fact that the word that follows due is process

2573366 when he gets back hes only pitched one time in a month so weve got to get him some work
2573367 the secret here is to get him healthy entirely and getting him pitching and keeping him healthy
2573368 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2573369 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient

2573371 one minute youre in a quarterback battle and the next minute its completely different there are two ways to look at this you can get down about it or turn it into a positive i get to pick the brain of a future hall of famer that chance doesnt come along too often
2573372 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city

2573376 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2573377 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2573378 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2573379 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2573380 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2573381 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2573382 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2573383 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2573384 i decided to invest in creating the equivalent for my mothers side
2573385 you still need to write or go to the repository to get the original document
2573386 but eight years ago if you wrote nassau county for a record it would take six to eight weeks to get it now with the index which weve also given to the county it takes a week to get the document in the mail
2573387 milk that goes in the mouth comes out the nose
2573388 every time i do that i get up and see the squashed spot from my big butt tocks and i have to remind myself
2573389 hoera hoera dat kunnen we wel zien dat ben jij
2573390 well see how he feels as the afternoon progresses im not saying that well be able to use him im not saying were not
2573391 when hes ready hes ready i dont know i dont anticipate it being long term just hope its not as long as the finger
2573392 when he gets back hes only pitched one time in a month so weve got to get him some work
2573393 the secret here is to get him healthy entirely and getting him pitching and keeping him healthy
2573394 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2573395 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2573396 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2573397 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2573398 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2573399 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2573400 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2573401 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2573402 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2573403 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2573404 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2573405 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2573406 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2573407 ach w re ich doch magers chtig ich f nde das gut das ist doch komisch oder
2573408 she had found someone to take my place on a pre arranged holiday with friends and that she would give me the money next time she saw me

2573426 it represents almost five years of hard work which could not have been accomplished without the commitment of the negotiating committee and the support of the flight attendants at asa we would like to also acknowledge the assistance that the national mediation board provided during the negotiations
2573427 as well as one of the most successful debut single to be release in the country 13 the success of utadas singles eventually lead the album
2573428 addicted to you the first single from the album breaking the one million mark in its first week and reaching 1 on the oricon singles chart for two consecutive weeks a personal first and eventually netting sales of 1 784 000 copies remaining utadas most successful single of all time

2573430 i dont think its the music that im concerned about its obviously that i look really different and there really arent any completely asian people who are popular singers in the u s right now

2573434 granted the petition filed by the flight attendants and stewards association of the philippines fasap seeking a reversal of the court of appeals ca decision upholding pals retrenchment program
2573435 because it failed to take into account each cabin attendants respective service record thereby disregarding seniority and loyalty in the evaluation of overall employee performance
2573436 directed to pay the dismissed employees their full back wages inclusive of allowances and other benefits computed from the time of their separation up to the time of the actual reinstatement when reinstatement is no longer feasible the court ordered pal to pay the back wages in lieu of the reinstatement and separation pay equal to one months pay for every year of service
2573437 in the coming years many decisions that could reshape the face of aviation will be made while the chorus for unfettered global aviation ownership and service grows louder also it is crucial that policymakers in washington realize that the u s aviation system since deregulation has failed airline employees communities and consumers we are at a turning point and need a president who recognizes this struggle
2573438 while afa cwa strongly supports both democrats and republicans for offices that have an impact on the flight attendant profession the record of the two candidates for president on issues of importance to our industry and our profession the choice is clear
2573439 we must choose the future for our profession that continues to value our work as front line responders and safety professionals in a strong and vibrant u s aviation system
2573440 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said

2573448 flight cx708 encountered the turbulence when the fasten seatbelt sign had been illuminated about 12 minutes prior to landing
2573449 no one can do everything but everyone can do anything
2573450 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2573451 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2573452 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that

2573454 the legendary no 4 has now become jet favre and were delighted to welcome him to city hall
2573455 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2573456 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
2573457 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2573458 its just a good experience of meeting people and communicating with them
2573459 i think its the best choice ive ever made in my entire life i wish i would have done it sooner
2573460 hes not one to relax very easily hes always one to do something
2573461 when there is a reduction in force the flight attendant s with the least system seniority shall be laid off

2573463 i am extremely pleased to be able to recognise lynseys actions with this special commendation through her brave efforts along with other motorists she helped in saving a life
2573464 she is a credit not only to herself but to her family and the company she works for i know that the firefighters at the scene were impressed with her response and brought her actions to my attention for appropriate formal recognition the crew manager in charge of the incident stated he would happy for lynsey to join the fire amp rescue service should she ever consider changing careers our gain would be virgins loss
2573465 after seeing the car accident i realised quickly that it was serious and that because of my training i could maybe be of some help it didnt occur to me that being on the wrong side of the motorway would be a problem so i decided to stop and walk across to the other side i think because i was in my work uniform i was still in work mode so my reaction was to help as quickly as possible and use my first aid training i was just pleased i could help and feel honoured to receive this commendation

2573468 the emirates uniform has been the same since 1997 with a few tweaks here and there in this new design we have addressed style comfort the suitability for different climates for cabin crew and ground staff and managed to retain the iconic and instantly recognizable hallmark of our uniform worldwide
2573469 im immensely proud of the in house team from emirates who worked with uk based uniform supplier simon jersey plc using a catalogue approach with mix and match items they have produced a superb uniform that can be adapted to suit different environments and climates this is vital when the conditions on the ground for staff can vary from sao paulo in brazil to newcastle in england to hong kong in asia
2573470 a one time opportunity for eligible flight attendants to voluntarily separate from the company
2573471 to purchase cobra for continued medical coverage for 18 months at the full cost of the insurance and administration
2573472 this is a breakthrough for cabin crew employees at flyglobespan they have sought nothing more than the basic right to be heard in their workplace they are a dedicated and professional group of workers who have served passengers well in difficult circumstances
2573473 they are now entitled to be rewarded for their efforts with improved terms and conditions of employment we will now be entering into discussions with the company with the intention of establishing a positive relationship and one that acts on the concerns of flyglobespans cabin crew
2573474 we are shocked and we are in a state of disbelief our base has been in operation in halifax for 32 years so this is essentially the end of an era for us
2573475 more generous seats wider aisles gourmet chef prepared meals and the emirates personal touch mean passengers could be mistaken for thinking theyve settled in the wrong cabin class
2573476 theres a cleverly designed table that never gets in your way a seat that slickly becomes a fully flat bed and laptop stowage
2573477 is designed to make passengers feel like they are in their own executive club
2573478 this proposal is insulting irrational and fails to be fair and equitable
2573479 we have made repeated requests to review management and non contract employee concessions but have not received this information which is particularly critical in light of what happened during our last round of concessions in 2003 shortly after we took pay and work rule cuts management gave themselves a pay increase and restored the concessions from all other non union work groups
2573480 as we wait and see what the future holds for midwest airlines we will continue to do everything we can to protect the careers of midwest flight attendants
2573481 i dont know what to say i am just angry over what i got
2573482 its not fair that i get a cent after saving for so many years at the end of the day i ask myself why i banked the money its ridiculous to say the least
2573483 i was told the shares would give me an advantage to access loans but all that never happened instead i lost out because how can i get a cent after investing for so many years
2573484 the rosary is the most powerful weapon to touch the heart of jesus our redeemer who so loves his mother

2573486 no s si darle el s o el no a evo morales no queremos al presidente que tenemos pero no sabemos que va a pasar al no tenerlo qui n se va a quedar en su lugar
2573487 por supuesto voy a apoyar al prefecto porque queremos la autonom a
2573488 estamos seguros de que el presidente morales va a ganar el pueblo est con l porque ha hecho muchos cambios
2573489 nos s que va a pasar si contin an los prefectos porque no los queremos
2573490 si tanto evo morales como los prefectos de las regiones auton micas son ratificados el empate pol tico subsiste nadie habr vencido sobre el otro
2573491 en tales circunstancias ser m s dif cil la presencia del estado en las prefecturas que confirmen a sus gobernantes y no a morales las regiones tal vez empiecen a decir que no reconocen la autoridad del presidente
2573492 recordemos que las regiones celebraron referendos para aprobar sus estatutos auton micos sin que estuvieran garantizados por la constituci n ocurre lo mismo con la consulta de este domingo que no ha sido avalada por el tribunal constitucional
2573493 si nadie se rige seg n las normas no podemos tener certeza de que el resultado del revocatorio sea aceptado

2573495 the normal assumption would be that rich internet applications are kind of the same as web applications security wise
2573496 google gears for example just gives a tiny little dialog that says do you want something to use gears
2573497 theres things in firefox now where you can change the way the browser handles different types of content like what you use as your mail client just from a single request from a web page
2573498 i think people have been really casual about introducing a lot of these mechanisms without really understanding the implications
2573499 theres a need to educate developers that this kind of flaw now pertains to client side security and not just attacking servers theyre just waiting to get bitten by it
2573500 people think flash is safe and traditionally flash has been trapped in your browser but now with adobe air flash is let out
2573501 the attacks were talking about right now it is unlikely that youre going to see them in the wild

2573505 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2573506 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2573507 the first time up the major climb of the finish circuit has substantially damaged the peloton but we are still waiting on names and time gaps

2573512 include substantial evidence that delta flight attendants were denied a free and fair election due to managements aggressive tactics aimed at defeating union representation
2573513 delta flight attendants were denied the opportunity to freely participate in this election without being intimidated by management and heavy handed efforts to keep them from gaining a voice a majority of delta flight attendants wanted the opportunity to have an election and they deserve an election that is free and fair we now look for the nmb to stand up for that right and hold delta executives accountable for their actions
2573514 the entire balmain team was thrilled to embark on the mission of designing the singapore airlines male cabin crew uniform and bringing to it our own international touch
2573515 in designing this new look our main aim was to retain the legendary elegance of the singapore airlines male cabin crew but at the same time make it more consistent with the iconic creation of mr pierre balmains sarong kebaya our challenge was therefore to find a matching smartness and unique sophistication for the male crew uniform
2573516 the new uniform projects a smart and professional image and will instill a sense of pride in the crew this is even more so since many of our crew members were themselves actively involved in the selection and fine tuning of the design concept and colour scheme of the uniform
2573517 will cut benefits like parking and dry cleaning payments and subsidized uniforms
2573518 autofocus is fast and accurate zooming is linear and precise image stabilization relegates my tripod to permanent residence in my trunk
2573519 i consistently get excellent images with the 70 300mm is in all conditions
2573520 the image stabilization easily gives me 3 or 4 real stops improvement at 300mm where i need it allowing me to use it in daylight at 300mm hand held
2573521 so long as you stop down a stop or two your technique will be your biggest barrier to sharp photos
2573522 in actual use i see no difference between the 70 300mm is and my new 1000 canon 70 200mm f 4 l is

2573525 wrath attack ble dannet i slutten av 2007 av the judge og the bottlecrusher vi hadde lyst til spille musikk vi selv h rer p og liker og vi tok kontakt med de to andre for sjekke interessen vi kj rte et par vinger hvor vi spilte inn demoen v r p den andre kjapt og g li demoen ble s sendt ut til media og folk ser ut til like det de h rer bortsett fra det har vel ikke s mye skjedd
2573526 man vs caravan 1 0 need we say more mer b r vi kanskje ikke si pga konomiske rsaker bortsett fra at det var endel alkohol inni bildet
2573527 selvsagt kunne lyden v rt bedre men tatt i betrakning at den ble spilt inn p v r andre ving er vi forn yde med resultatet vi h per uansett p at vi f r vd endel i sommer og f r spilt inn i et skikkelig studio i neste omgang
2573528 a4 liv religion falske folk og vassendgutane rett og slett generelle ting som kan gj re hver og en fly forbanna ellers er vel band som kreator slayer legion of the damned og destruction viktige stikkord n r det gjelder inspirasjon
2573529 planen er mekke flere l ter i sommer og evt spille inn disse for en fremtidig utgivelse om det blir demo eller full skive er enn ikke bestemt n r det gjelder konserter s er dette selvsagt nskelig men det f r komme n r vi har flere l ter klare vi har uansett stor tro p at materialet vi har s langt vil fungere bra live
2573530 det mest korrekte er vel kalle det et seri st prosjekt wrath attack ble jo i utgangspunktet startet fordi vi hadde lyst til jamme og mekke et par l ter og se hvordan det gikk vi har i det siste f tt en god del positiv feedback p det vi har gjort og det gj r jo ikke akkurat at vi mister motivasjonen til fortsette spille
2573531 etter at vi annonserte at vi kom til legge ut demoen v r gratis p nett fikk vi endel oppmerksomhet bl a tok itavisen kontakt med oss og kj rte en liten sak p oss det at vi fikk trynet v rt klint opp p fremsiden av norges st rste it nettside gjorde jo ikke akkurat at interessen dabbet av plutselig hadde vi hatt et par tusen bes k b de p myspace og nettsiden v r n r det gjelder nedlastning mener vi at platebransjen er relativt seiglivet det er uten tvil platebransjen som er problemet her og ikke selve nedlastingen hvorfor skal en fan av et band reise 10 mil til cd butikken st i butikken og lytte p 30 sekunder for deretter punge ut 200 spenn for ei skive som sannsynligvis suger uansett mens han istedet kunne sittet hjemme med en iskald l og lasta skiten gratis mao burde platebransjen finne nye og innovative m ter tjene p musikken det g r jo mer og mer over til at band gj r jobben som labels o l har gjort f r og kj rer promotering o l p internett en annen ting er jo ogs at produktet du kj per i butikken som regel er d rligere enn det du f r gratis bl a inneholder skivene kopisperrer o l som gj r det umulig spille av skiva i bilstereo mp3 spiller osv de kan sperre s mye de vil men konsekvensen blir at de sperrer for seg selv

2573538 why then say the scribes that elijah must first come
2573539 elijah truly shall first come and restore all things but i say unto you that elijah is come already and they didnt know him but have done unto him whatever they wanted likewise shall the son of man suffer of them
2573540 lord have mercy on my son for he is a lunatic and sore vexed
2573541 o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you and jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of the child and he was cured that very hour
2573542 because of your unbelief for truly i say unto you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove although this kind goes not out but by prayer and fasting
2573543 i can do all things through christ who strengthens me
2573544 if you have faith and do not doubt you can tell this mountain to move on out
2573545 what are you thinking simon who do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute their own children or strangers
2573546 then are the children free notwithstanding lest we should offend them go to the sea cast a hook and take up the first fish that you catch when you open his mouth you will find a piece of money take that and give it to them for me and you
2573547 master we know you say and teach rightly neither do you play favorites but do you truly teach the way of god is it lawful for us to give tribute unto caesar or not
2573548 why do you tempt me whose image and superscription does it have
2573549 render unto caesar the things that are caesars and unto god the things that are gods

2573551 the means of transmission replaced the content of culture as the center of historical excitement and as the marker of social status
2573552 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2573553 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2573554 obviously it turns a defining element of his biography his reputation as a devoted family man upside down
2573555 but if he shows a continued commitment to his core issues and no additional facts emerge that contradict his story he could eventually join the disturbingly large club of public figures whove rebounded from similar events
2573556 i must perish in this deplorable folly thus thus and not otherwise shall i be lost i dread the events of the future not in themselves but in their results i shudder at the thought of any even the most trivial incident which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul i have indeed no abhorrence of danger except in its absolute effect in terror in this unnerved in this pitiable condition i feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when i must abandon life and reason together in some struggle with the grim phantasm fear
2573557 this is the type of night that creates those crazy homeless people you see walking around
2573558 you cant stop dancing if you stop it will all be over
2573559 its there for a short time its glamorous its big it produces something special its star quality
2573560 it smells like a mix of rotten fish and rotten meat its quite impressive
2573561 i appeal to you brethren to take note of those who create dissensions and difficulties
2573562 if you put these instructions before the brethren you will be a good minister of christ jesus nourished on the words of the faith and of the good doctrine which you have followed
2573563 any one who goes ahead and does not abide in the doctrine of christ does not have god he who abides in the doctrine has both the father and the son if any one comes to you and does not bring this doctrine do not receive him into the house or give him any greeting
2573564 and jesus answered him blessed are you simon bar jona for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father who is in heaven and i tell you you are peter and
2573565 if your brother sins against you go and tell him his fault between you and him alone if he listens to you you have gained your brother but if he does not listen take one or two others along with you that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses if he refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if he refuses to listen even to the church let him be to you as a gentile and a tax collector truly i say to you whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven again i say to you if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask it will be done for them by my father in heaven for where two or three are gathered in my name there am i in the midst of them
2573566 i dont go to church because of all the self righteous hypocrites
2573567 the church is a hospital for sinners not a museum for saints
2573568 they notified us of potential offenders in our jurisdiction and we launched an investigation
2573569 i have some ratted up pictures i need to frame
2573570 these are excellent appointments for aer arann because they offer both a smooth transition period and high levels of continuity as we continue with our development plans
2573571 we have known for some time that garry was due to retire
2573572 and it was important for us to retain his expertise on the board and to appoint a new ceo with the experience ability and drive that will allow aer arann to build on our success as europes fastest growing regional airline
2573573 leading aer aranns team of talented and committed airline professionals
2573574 there is no doubt that these are challenging times for the airline industry globally
2573575 but i believe we have both the right fleet and route network to allow us to face those challenges by building on our direct access business model
2573576 and as more join the fleet they will increase our ability to compete effectively while maintaining superior levels of customer service
2573577 it was a major coup for aer arann when garry agreed to join us as ceo almost three years ago
2573578 his experience as a senior airline executive over many years including those as chief executive of both aer lingus and liat in the caribbean was invaluable as we developed our route network and built an airline that could compete successfully in the european market
2573579 personally i am delighted that garry has accepted our invitation to join the board of aer arann
2573580 and the fact that his knowledge and experience will continue to be available to us augurs very well for the future
2573581 chief executive with talent and ambition coupled with an obvious commitment to aer arann and a strong desire to lead its development as a leading european regional carrier
2573582 we are a nation of consumers and theres nothing wrong with that

2573585 non violent drug offenses are being over prosecuted and corporate crime is being under prosecuted
2573586 the justice department must begin to reverse course crank up the crackdown on corporate crime and end the cruel and inhumane war on non violent drug possession
2573587 the criminal justice system is broken so badly that one hardly knows where to begin describing the breakdown
2573588 lets start with the war on drugs since commentators across the political spectrum recognize its lunacy we pour almost endless resources roughly 50 billion every year into catching trying and incarcerating people who primarily harm themselves this insane war on drugs damages communities and drains crucial resources from the police courts and prisons these resources could be better used to combat serious street and corporate crime that directly violates the publics liberty health safety trust and financial well being as with alcoholics and nicotine addicts the approach to drug addicts should be rehabilitation not incarceration
2573589 the current drug policy has consumed tens of billions of dollars and wrecked countless lives
2573590 the costs of this policy include the increasing breakdown of families and neighborhoods endangerment of children widespread violation of civil liberties escalating rates of incarceration political corruption and the imposition of united states policy abroad in practice the drug war disproportionately targets people of color and people who are poverty stricken coercive measures have not reduced drug use but they have clogged our criminal justice system with non violent offenders it is time to explore alternative approaches and to end this costly war
2573591 probably would not have gone on to have the career you have had
2573592 it is urgent that the u s reverse the incarceration binge the u s department of justice estimates that if incarceration rates remain unchanged an estimated one of every 20 americans and greater than one in four african americans can be expected to serve time in prison during their lifetime
2573593 it is time to make the failed war on drugs a central issue in the american political dialogue for too long we have let this injustice continue to grow unhindered taking action on clemency at the federal level will set an example for the states and begin the process of reversing this failed policy
2573594 the current cruel unjust policy perpetuated and enforced by the bush administration prevents americans who suffer from debilitating illnesses from experiencing the relief of medicinal cannabis
2573595 while substantial scientific and anecdotal evidence exists to validate marijuanas usefulness in treating disease a deluge of rhetoric from washington claims that marijuana has no medicinal value
2573596 in need of alternative crops and aware of the growing market for industrial hemp particularly for bio composite products such as automobile parts farmers in the united states are forced to watch from the sidelines while canadian french and chinese farmers grow the crop and american manufacturers import it from them
2573597 there now is a significant and growing backlog of criminal investigations and unresolved matters
2573598 were trying to come to grips with the end of a 20 year secular credit expansion that went parabolic in the last six years
2573599 the u s economy is at the outset of the first consumer recession since the early 1990s and its facing headwinds comparable to the six quarter recession that pushed the standard amp poors index down 40 percent in the 1970s
2573600 weve gone from housing to credit to employment and now i think were going to start to see some negative consumer spending numbers now that were past this fiscal stimulus program

2573603 he came with a new tenant but i declined to vacate
2573604 secondly the board failed to appreciate that the purported notice of eviction is defective in that the respondent did not specify legal grounds for the notice as he simply says its for urgent personal use
2573605 thirdly the board failed to reckon and appreciate marians protestations that rentals were being demanded in foreign currency

2573608 n o acreditamos que tenha sido um atentado premeditado contra cidad os norte americanos da mesma forma que pensamos que nada disto se relaciona com os jogos ol mpicos
2573609 a r ssia iniciou uma invas o militar da ge rgia em grande escala
2573610 durante toda a noite bombardeios russos tentaram atingir oleodutos que est o a centenas e centenas de quil metros da zona de conflito
2573611 n o se trata apenas de parar os combates na zona de conflito eles est o destruindo meu pa s minha democracia controlando as rotas de energia para a europa e fazendo tudo isto de maneira brutal porque basicamente 90 das pessoas que eles mataram s o civis que est o sendo deliberadamente atacados
2573612 historicamente sempre que a r ssia atacou um pa s vizinho afirmou que foi uma invas o provocada eles sempre disseram ter ido resgatar minorias na pol nia na finl ndia sempre tiveram um pretexto para invadir a hungria a tchecoslov quia o afeganist o isso a velha propaganda sovi tica

2573620 that wasnt bad but it was only a heat so hopefully i can get another good one in the final

2573622 it was one of my best prelim swims things were playing on my mind a little bit you cant come here and not feel the pressure
2573623 there were a few nerves again today but they werent too bad

2573625 i am looking forward to the challenge in the final
2573626 nobody expects too much of you out there but i am going to bring some fire from the outside

2573647 thats why john mccain will go hide at his ranch for a few days and be done with it poor obama he doesnt have a ranch
2573648 getting him in a swimming suit will be one of the big gets
2573649 one of the great mistakes campaigns make is that we just burn out the candidates
2573650 particularly after he won the nomination kerry needed to take some time that is when he made a couple of mistakes in public events that he would not have made if he had taken off a few weeks
2573651 we are going to correct that this week hopefully with your help
2573652 i want you to know that we arent here to politick
2573653 the main purpose of me being here right now before i head off and see my grandma is to say thank you to all of you because all of you worked so hard to put me in a position where i may have the honor of serving as your president of the united states
2573654 i remember any number of people at the time saying that should have gone to his wife teresas farm
2573655 there was a message that we thought would be conveyed by marthas vineyard that may not be positive
2573656 for somebody who has been called elitist going to hawaii is not exactly going against type
2573657 you shouldnt hold it against him because it is a nice place to have a vacation anybody who picks on him for going to hawaii is really looking for something to pick on

2573660 we knew we had to bat well in the second innings and we are even stevens now if we can string another or two partnerships together it could be quite a good test match
2573661 the thing about him is that he scores so quickly weve always rated him highly he had a problem when he started but he was one of the guys we identified to bat three for us we needed to run with him and give him the opportunity hes blossomed and repaid the faith we showed in him

2573781 i called this a small because its just a mirror image of the right handed torsion controller we already built really its easy especially if we use the jlefty third party module

2573804 we urge the georgian authorities to immediately stop their aggression against south ossetia to stop all violations of all standing agreements on a ceasefire and to respect the legal rights and interests of other people
2573805 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2573806 stressed that the only way out of the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone

2573917 nfs is getting pressure from clustered file systems like lustre and gpfs as well as custom file systems produced by web 2 0 service providers such as google gfs
2573918 even for files too small to stripe those files can be distributed across multiple nfs servers which provides statistical load balancing
2573919 with a capable cluster of nfs servers and a back end file system files or ranges within files can be relocated transparent to the applications accessing data over pnfs
2573920 pnfs moves the metadata server out of the data transfer path
2573921 instead of having to deal with a number of competing proprietary and open source parallel file systems pnfs will allow users to reap the benefits of parallel storage systems by choosing best of breed solutions without having concerns over vendor lock in
2573922 for environments that need improved performance for large sequential files where parallel access is needed pnfs has some legs moving forward
2573923 however not every environment or application needs parallel access to data
2573924 for mainstream markets pnfs will most likely remain a niche at least near term being used for specialized applications and environments
2573925 the big benefactors of pnfs will be the parallel file systems like those from ibm sun ibrix and others as well as proprietary storage systems like those from panasas
2573926 the architecture for the pnfs proposal was derived from the panasas directflow parallel protocol which is a core component utilized by the panasas panfs parallel file system
2573927 the directflow protocol used in our activestor parallel storage clusters currently provides essentially all of the functionality expected to be available in the nfs 4 1 later this year

2573969 o segundo ano que participo o evento est fant stico adorei a oficina de gastronomia foi um dos momentos mais prazerosos para mim
2573970 we are excited to bring our unique approach to cosmetology education to new markets
2573971 our campuses mirror upscale salons and provide an exceptional education that benefits our students the salon community and the public
2573972 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2573973 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2573974 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2573975 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2573976 the project would install a gigantic public water fountain at the intersection of l a s harbor and santa monica freeways and then use the fountains water supply as a way to graph traffic accidents and fatalities occurring on highways throughout the greater l a area when a fatality occurs the fountain attains its highest level and fades to blue
2573977 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2573978 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2573979 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2573980 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2573981 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2573982 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2573983 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2573984 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2573985 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2573986 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2573987 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2573988 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2573989 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2573990 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2573991 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2573992 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2573993 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2573994 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2573995 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2573996 when we initially left we got to the lights and i said to him have you still got the piece with you he said no
2573997 so we drove back got the piece delivered him to the hospital and they reattached it
2573998 he was losing a bit of blood as you do with the nerves that run into the tips of your fingers i made sure he was well and he was looked after
2573999 they were really helpful and pleasant and kept the guy calm
2574000 just done what anyone else would do which is pretty much help someone who needed a bit of help
2574001 its terrible weve been warning the police about this for some time now and nothing has been done
2574002 this is the only country in the world as far as we know where youre allowed to do this its bloody disgusting
2574003 we have a fantastic relationship with police arms officers they are aware of how stringent we are
2574004 weve got a system in place that is trusting people to do the right thing
2574005 theres nothing stopping them from saying i saw his licence its your word against theirs
2574006 i would expect the police to be looking at this and the minister national will be looking at this if we get in later this year
2574007 ahead of the toronto transit commissions efforts to secure ca 6b for its proposed
2574008 thirty per cent drop in traffic would save nearly 200 lives and 900 million in health costs citys medical officer of health says
2574009 children too feel the effects with an estimated 1 200 cases of acute bronchitis a year caused by traffic pollution children are also more likely to suffer from asthma and the report blames 68 000 asthma symptom days each year in torontos population on tailpipe emissions it also found 67 000 acute respiratory system days when people suffer from coughing wheezing and other symptoms
2574010 a struggle to the death commits all combatants to inflicting a maximum amount of destruction on the enemy within the shortest span of time
2574011 unreservedly glad that science put this new weapon at our disposal before the end of the war
2574012 bloated and scorched such an awesome sight their legs and bodies stripped of clothes and burned with a huge blister
2574013 trying to establish a propaganda point that the bombings should be stopped
2574014 no satisfaction in the thought that an american air crew had produced what must without doubt be the greatest simultaneous slaughter in the whole history of mankind
2574015 that was because we wished in the first attack to avoid in so far as possible the killing of civilians

2574020 his feet dangling and within reach the men and boys played with the corpse by swinging it back and forth against the building to hear the dull thud
2574021 it wasnt in mississippi it was in illinois that jarred people
2574022 add the fact that its where lincoln is buried you have a lot of symbolism lincoln was a live memory to a lot of people
2574023 i found it hypocritical that in this town its all about lincoln we want to embrace him then you find out whoah this is who we are this is springfield
2574024 all day and all night long he had a gun on each shoulder and he marched from where our store was to our home and that was back and forth all evening
2574025 its a history that has to be brought out into the open it really has to be
2574026 it is extremely important that we take time to recognize the significance of the race riots that we teach our children all about them
2574027 and that we rededicate ourselves to the notion that we must all work together to ensure that something like that never happens again
2574028 a child has to know where he comes from he needs to know what this country is about
2574029 theyre angry theyre wondering why they have gotten into their teen years without learning about it
2574030 theyre shocked at what humans beings do to each other
2574031 white americans in the north pretty much thought violence against blacks was a southern thing the springfield riot really came as a bolt of lightning to northern newspaper readers
2574032 the question was if it can happen in springfield maybe it can happen anywhere
2574033 this was the right thing to do theres no question in my mind
2574034 they turned it into tourism dollars this horror that occurred in their hometown
2574035 this would be like seeing a shirt that had the towers falling on 9 11 people making money off the tragedy that everyone had to endure
2574036 the negroes would come to the window and rush back they didnt dare come out for fear theyd get shot they went back in and anybody that i knew or talked to said there were negroes in there that were burned up
2574037 its a funny thing i can understand why few people want to talk you can see right away that youre accused of participation just by assumption
2574038 our only input was we told him we wanted it to sound like his 80s work that we loved so much and we wanted to have the plot in it and we wanted him to say the title as many times as he could
2574039 i cant talk religion to a man with bodily hunger in his eyes
2574040 in speaking to a group of black legislators obama said a good economic development plan for our community would be if we make sure folks weren t throwing their garbage out of their cars
2574041 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2574042 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2574043 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2574044 if you dont want ice in your drink this is the way to do it
2574045 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2574046 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2574047 c program files java jre1 6 0 05 bin jusched exe
2574048 c program files common files real update ob realsched exe
2574049 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2574050 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2574051 susanita tiene un rat n un rat n chiquit n
2574052 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2574055 i shouldnt eat all this until after i run today

2574057 both the creationists iders and the militant atheists are wrong that darwinian evolution is compatible with christianity and that we need to treat darwin as a supremely gifted scientist and not the mascot or demon for one anti religious cause or another
2574058 overall i ran a little harder today and i hit a little more today as well
2574059 i didnt have any problems and i felt pretty good afterwards too its another step forward
2574060 theres no doubt about it i feel confident now if i keep progressing
2574061 just look at how close it is its anyones at the moment and its just a case of doing everything right on the day
2574062 there wasnt much between us so its going to be an interesting final tomorrow morning i feel happy with that it was good comfortable with a fast qualifying time
2574063 park went pretty fast it was probably his best time or right on it
2574064 i knew id have to do the same thing to take it back in my heat
2574065 i hope for the best tomorrow morning im going to have a double shot espresso coffee and ill be ready
2574066 it was a relatively good performance but i will have to wait and see how it will go now
2574067 actually i thought about it before the competition im in the same heat with park tae hwan and in the next heat there will be so i just have to try my best otherwise i might not even make the final

2574074 the french cycling federation ffc is dealing with the case
2574075 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
2574076 as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations
2574077 however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games
2574078 sites that you need to have for your job its important that you raise them for bocogs awareness
2574079 the censorship situation for those web sites has not loosened at all
2574080 we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region thats very industrially active
2574081 by determining the effects of soot reductions during the olympics on atmospheric heating we can gain much needed insights into the magnitude of future global warming
2574082 these technologies will provide new estimates of solar irradiance aerosol cloud interactions climate forcing and important components of the biogeochemical cycles of the east asian and western pacific ocean region

2574109 obviously it turns a defining element of his biography his reputation as a devoted family man upside down
2574110 but if he shows a continued commitment to his core issues and no additional facts emerge that contradict his story he could eventually join the disturbingly large club of public figures whove rebounded from similar events
2574111 the normal assumption would be that rich internet applications are kind of the same as web applications security wise

2574113 theres things in firefox now where you can change the way the browser handles different types of content like what you use as your mail client just from a single request from a web page
2574114 i think people have been really casual about introducing a lot of these mechanisms without really understanding the implications
2574115 theres a need to educate developers that this kind of flaw now pertains to client side security and not just attacking servers theyre just waiting to get bitten by it

2574141 i have a 110 acre farm where i grow trees and i try to protect the environment
2574142 i dont want the turkey farm to come in and degrade our area ive invested quite a bit into where i live for future generations and i dont think someone should be able to come in and destroy it
2574143 if someone is opposed they can appeal to our board and the board can either decide to uphold or overturn our decision
2574144 if the board decides to uphold our decision the person who appealed if he or she still isnt happy they can take it to the state administrative law court
2574145 we are still waiting because the public has a chance to appeal the boards decision to the state
2574146 we are just waiting but its definitely been a hardship on my family you have to wait when all youre trying to do is make a better life for your children
2574147 i say its his haseldens property he can do what he wants with it
2574148 the turkeys should be let loose eating grass not put in those cages the way they will do so i know one thing i wont be eating haseldens or anyone elses caged turkey
2574149 i think one thing thats important to remember is that we dont regulate zoning of the area
2574150 one thing people always say is that they live in a residential area or they dont want the farm next door to them but if its zoned for agricultural or not zoned at all we take the appropriate steps from there when it comes to permitting

2574166 no no do you write from your head or the body
2574167 im very in their minds about whats going through their thoughts at a given moment in fact
2574168 you wrote about a fifteen year old girl in this manuscript but we didnt feel that it felt like you but if youd written it from the body of a teenaged girl starving high up on a girder as shes waiting for a charity boat to come down the river with her food youre going to notice different things

2574172 there are things that you can do individually though to save energy
2574173 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
2574174 the department of energys designated economist on this issue indicated that of the 130 billion gallons of fuel that the transportation research board trb 2 estimated were used in passenger cars and light trucks in 2005 about 1 2 billion gallons were wasted as a result of driving on underinflated tires
2574175 the other thing is they are making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by three to four percent
2574176 its like these guys take pride in being ignorant they think its funny that theyre making fun of something that is actually true

2574227 i am in favor of a free economy a free economy cannot exist without competition therefore men must be forced to compete therefore we must control men in order to force them to be free
2574228 quite so just as logic is a primitive vulgarity in philosophy
2574229 need is the only consideration if people are in need weve got to seize things first and talk about it afterwards
2574230 but surely you wouldnt want me to do anything about it my mines and your railroad were seized by the will of the people you wouldnt want me to oppose the will of the people would you
2574231 isnt it generally conceded that when you hire a man for a job it is his need that counts not his ability doesnt everyone believe that in order to get the goods all you have to do is need them i have carried out every moral precept of our age i expected gratitude and a citation of honor i do not understand why i am being damned
2574232 to me theres only one form of human depravity the man without a purpose
2574233 if ones actions are honest one does not need the predated confidence of others only their rational perception the person who craves a moral blank check of that the confidence kind has dishonest intentions
2574234 muscles thats all it takes to build anything in the world
2574235 i never believed that story i thought by the time the sun was exhausted men would find a substitute
2574236 you go through life looking for beauty for greatness for some sublime achievement and what do you find a lof of trick machinery for making upholstered cars or inner spring mattresses
2574237 judgement to determine right and wrong vision to see the truth courage to act upon it dedication to that which is good integrity to stand by the good at any price
2574238 what is happening to people how could they accept it didnt they read it didnt they see dont they think
2574239 men are not open to truth or reason they cannot be reached by a rational arguement the mind is powerless against them yet we have to deal with them if we want to accomplish anything we have to decieve them into letting us accomplish it or force them they understand nothing else
2574240 that contradictions do not exist whenever you believe youve found one check your premises
2574241 contradictions do not exist whenever you think that you are facing a contradiction check your premises you will find that one of them is wrong
2574242 what are your mills a holy temple of some kind
2574243 dont you ever think of people and of your moral duties
2574244 you dont know what youre saying im not able ever to despise you enough to believe that you mean it
2574245 thats why i cant talk to you because youre not human you have no pity no feeling for your brother no compassion for his feelings
2574246 if you loved your brother youd give him a job he didnt deserve precisely because he didnt deserve it that would be true love and kindness and brotherhood else whats love for if a man deserves a job theres no virtue in giving it to him virtue is the giving of the undeserved
2574247 i dont like people who talk too much about how everything they do is just for the sake of others its not true and i dont think it would be right if it were true
2574248 if you come jim ill have you thrown out of your own station this is one event youre not going to see
2574249 cant you people look doomed please i know thats what the editor wants
2574250 i know what id like to be i wish i could be a man who covers
2574251 i saw pictures of new york and i thought somebody built those buildings he didnt just sit and whine that the kitchen was filthy and the roof leaking and the plumbing clogged and its a goddamn world and we were stinking poor and not giving a damn about it thats what i couldnt take that they didnt give a damn
2574252 he didnt do it for any noble purpose he did it just for his own profit hes never done anything for any other reason
2574253 there are no absolutes as dr pritchett has proved irrefutably
2574254 unhappiness is the hallmark of virtue if a man is unhappy really truly unhappy it means that he is a superior sort of person
2574255 the worst thing about people is not the insults they hand out but the compliments
2574256 so it seems like everybody owns the place and nobody
2574257 he didnt want to make money only to get it
2574258 as if a fellow cheat displaying his shrewdness to his partners in guilt
2574259 you and the charming lady who is not your wife
2574260 in this world either youre virtuous or you enjoy yourself not both
2574261 dont ever get mad at a man for stating the truth
2574262 if one of my blast furnaces goes down will i be able to keep it going by feeding your intention into it
2574263 the same kind of brain cant do both either youre good at running the mills or youre good at running to washington
2574264 what a crude question no enlightened person would ever ask it
2574265 well what is it that enlightened people do with thier lives

2574267 my objective was social progress human brotherhood and love love ms taggart that is the key to everything if men learned to love one another it would solve all their problems
2574268 i can proudly say that in all of my life i have never made a profit
2574269 mr lawson i think i should let you know that of all the statements a man can make that is the one i consider most dispicable
2574270 the man who uses anothers pity for him as a weapon
2574271 i didnt have much money to spend on such things as laboratories i had to have a brighter color scheme in my office and a decent modern bathroom with a stall shower furthermore i spent a lot of money on a new cafeteria and a playroom and rest room for the workers we had to have morale didnt we
2574272 from each according to his ability to each according to his need
2574273 rewards were based on need and the penalties on ability those who had not produced as much as the vote said they could were fined it required men to be motivated not by personal gain but by a love for their brothers
2574274 initial investigations revealed that the occupant of the home may have been experimenting with a home made moonshine set up when it exploded
2574275 i believe in compulsory cannibalism if people were forced to eat what they killed there would be no more wars
2574276 the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience but where he stands in times of challenge and controversy
2574277 if you want to change the world you have to change yourself first
2574278 we must be the change we wish to see in the world
2574279 i t is a common experience that a problem difficult at night is resolved in the morning after the committee of sleep has worked on it
2574280 those who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night
2574281 this symbol was created by a british pacifist textile designer gerard holtom and made its debut in londons trafalgar square where many gathered to support
2574282 remember that the best relationship is the one where your love for each other is greater than your need for each other
2574283 hes a cad a playboy he might be a very loyal friend but he is very disloyal in other ways
2574284 the only thing i know is that i paint because i need to and i paint always whatever passes through my head without any further consideration
2574285 hiding places there are innumerable escape is only one but possibilities of escape again are as many as hiding places
2574286 should i not wear cleats so that when i cut i will just fall instead of impact my knee
2574287 sometimes in life the glass seems half empty sometimes it seems half full and sometimes the glass is twice as large as it needs to be
2574288 twirl me about and twirl me around let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground and when i look up at you looking down say it was only a dream
2574289 yesterday is but todays memory and tomorrow is todays dream
2574290 if someone is going down the wrong road he doesnt need motivation to speed him up what he needs is education to turn him around
2574291 experience is that marvelous thing that enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again

2574303 sunt foarte fericit c joc aceste dou personaje este o ocazie rar cu care se nt lne te un actor este un motiv de bucurie ns presupune i un efort dublu
2574304 nimeni nu e perfect cu excep ia lui billy wilder atunci c nd se afl n plin form
2574305 am avut i eu ocazia de mai multe ori s plec n state dar chiar i aici n austria m am acomodat destul de greu de i locuiesc ntr un ora care se afl la doar cinci ore de oradea ora ul meu natal
2574306 practic de aici am putut veni acas cam o dat la dou luni
2574307 nu primeam ansa necesar pentru a juca c t mai mult ceea ce se nt mpl de altfel cu to i juniorii de la noi
2574308 am ajuns destul de t rziu acolo din cauza campaniei al turi de lotul na ional de seniori dar sistemul de desf urare a campionatului m a avantajat am apucat s joc n 35 de meciuri p n la sf r itul sezonului adic mai multe dec t a fi putut juca n rom nia
2574309 odat ce ai ajuns acolo cred c po i s spui c ai realizat tot ce puteai realiza n baschet
2574310 mergeam cu tat l meu i cu fo tii lui colegi de la dinamo oradea vechea genera ie a baschetului de aici la meciuri de old boys acolo mai venea din c nd n c nd i toni alexe pe atunci era mvp n campionatul ungariei era ceva extraordinar
2574311 a fost un model pentru mine nu neap rat din punctul de vedere al jocului pentru c evoluam pe alte posturi dar din punctul de vedere al atitudinii pe teren al mentalit ii i al temperamentului
2574312 n tinere e prima mea slujb a fost la tribunal stenografiam edin ele n sala de judecat dar dumnezeu a hot r t c trebuie s fac altceva i m a trimis spre actorie dac el a vrut s fiu actor atunci trebuie s i mul umesc f c nd zi de zi cu toat inima meseria asta

2574315 eu nu am mai prezentat un reality show p n acum i chiar aveam o impresie gre it c ar fi totul aranjat aici am constatat c totul este real f r niciun artificiu
2574316 eu ns mi am o familie i cu toate c sunt independent m simt n acela i timp protejat de dragostea i sus inerea so ului meu cred c le pot oferi un sprijin de n dejde acelor femei care lupt s i refac vie ile c ut nd b rbatul potrivit parte ner spiritual pentru ele i un tat bun pentru copiii lor
2574317 b rba ii respectivi sunt selecta i dup modul n care se prezint dup felul n care se descriu i dup a tept rile mamelor
2574318 emisiunea nu i propune s oblige candida ii s r m n mpreun este un prilej de a se cunoa te i de a se descoperi este alegerea i decizia lor dac vor s r m n mpreun le am cunoscut bine pe aceste mame i am r mas uimit de naturale ea lor
2574319 dup p rerea mea spune dr dumitra cu cel mai aproape de adev r este tensiometrul clasic cu stetoscop i aparat de tensiune cu manometru n ceea ce prive te aparatele care au invadat pia a care pot lua electronic pulsul i tensiunea nu spun c nu sunt bune se pun pe bra pe articula ie i merg pe artera radial care este o arter mai mic nu au o acuitate a a de mare ca cele clasice care merg pe artera brahial pacien ii vin i ntreab s cump r un aparat din acesta de tip nou pentru ei este mai u or cu un aparat de tip electronic care s le arate tensiunea i pulsul dec t cu unul de tip clasic
2574320 spre exemplu tensiometrul meu este verificat periodic la o lun o lun i jum tate de speciali ti n domeniu a a c am ncredere n rezultatele pe care mi le arat de multe ori compar valorile ntre cele dou tipuri de tensiometre i am constatat c acestea difer la unele mai pu in la altele mai mult n func ie de precizia aparatului din acest motiv l prefer pe cel clasic
2574321 dac suferi i de hipertensiune ave i o tensiune oscilant i dori i s o men ine i sub control o pute i face orientativ cu aparatul pe care l ave i acas iar acest lucru este foarte bun
2574322 n mod normal tensiunea luat n picioare trebuie s fie pu in mai mare dec t n pozi ia culcat

2574591 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
2574592 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank

2574650 our goal was simple find a form of combative fighting that could complement weekly ranger combative training in the 2nd ranger battalion a style that could be systematically taught to a 600 man ranger battalion a style that would prepare them for actual hand to hand combat the bottom line find a style that clearly enhances the individual rangers ability to quickly destroy his opponent one on one in combat while maximizing his own chances for survival it was an hour into training at the gracie academy when we realized that we had found our source this was the real thing

2574656 i went and sat between hades and grem at the table
2574657 you two nonconformist upstart bitches are giving me a migraine
2574658 that i dont already know your every squirming maggot of a thought i
2574659 you silly always getting worked up and dropping your eye why dont you pick up ones that fit and wheres your patch
2574660 when they pop in your mouth its just like caviar sprays the roots of your teeth similar taste mm and when you finish the membranes you can suck on the lens afterward very nice lingering flavour
2574661 drink that for fucks sake how do you ever expect to survive where youre headed next
2574662 do you know what it means to sacrifice for something you want
2574663 you two shits are so wrapped up in yourselves lately you think youre the badasses of the world and now youre going to peck in the dirt like goddamn chickens in the backyard over who rules the henyard lets set one thing straight gentlemen
2574664 and its a conversation ive had to have with samael and azazel and molloch and all the rest of the princes even my own sons
2574665 there is only one king of darkness and the underworld and its neither of you
2574666 if you ever want to contest that im welcoming the challenge but if you think youll steal it by making my firstborns brains ooze out her ears i will make you wish that id killed you ill make you wish it would stop
2574667 he still hasnt asked for her hand if you plan on sticking around dont make that mistake
2574668 and technically if you are dense enough to think she is not and has not always been her own woman youd best swallow that shes still entirely mine
2574669 you invented polyamoury now youd give it up in your last life instead of tossing up a shining example
2574670 what precisely did you think you were working for all these years it was your magnum opus your souls work all you lacked was the right balance
2574671 for fucks sake hephaestion why didnt you see this coming
2574672 and at the moment the three of you converge there is the possibility of shattering history of cracking human possibility a shifting of consciousness
2574673 i thought you idiots had it figured this past spring i hand selected the souls that could handle it the souls that were ripe for unconventional adventures as far afield as possible and dropped you in each others paths now you two
2574674 then tell me why would you hurt the other why would you fight over this why would you let this rip each other apart destroying both of you in ways youre not even calculating forever
2574675 and why if you love her would you make her do some foolish thing to prove her love for you when it has nothing to do with that that is not love that is possession and you are no better than selfish children
2574676 and i dont understand you fear of the boy boy the what did you say
2574677 its totally normal for completely straight adult men to end up with each others tongues in their mouths
2574678 she was my first i spent more time designing and constructing her than you can calculate and like athena supposed sprang forth from my little brothers migraine so did this idea pour entirely from my thoughts such a part of me we felt one flesh as though i gave birth as a female would she was excellent in debate and the arts and never once lost an argument it was torture when i was forced to hide her far from her natural realm and she became my son and became my hand in the world and took control of her brothers do not think you can tame or leash a force like that
2574679 although occasionally you recognize the mind you two are so attached to the skin and hair concealing it
2574680 youre entirely missing the soul inhabiting it you two are so dizzy over her face you dont even know who she is
2574681 and you will be spending some quality time with me at your earliest convenience set a day aside
2574682 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2574683 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2574684 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2574685 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2574686 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2574687 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2574688 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2574689 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear

2574700 restrictions were placed on trawling with the enabling law in 2001 forcing the commercial fishing companies to only use the method in deeper waters thus benefiting local fisherman
2574701 we have approved the law prohibiting trawling because we decided that what we had done was not enough we will help commercial fishers convert over to traditional fishing methods
2574702 the production quadrupled a growth of 300 percent and thats going to continue to go up
2574703 some iranian leaders have called for israels destruction and israel is within the reach of some iranian missiles
2574704 we want to make sure were prepared for every option we dont want war we want peace but we will not let that second holocaust take place
2574705 says iran is renowned for using diplomacy as a stall tactic
2574706 i dont think that anybody really does believe that theres a diplomatic solution the iranians are well known for attrition and wearing down their opponents with never ending negotiations that can go on and on this is their strategy and has been their strategy forever
2574707 iran is a country which is openly committed to destroying israel is committed to performing another holocaust i think that whats happened in israel the third generation after the holocaust has sort of gone back to a holocaust mentality sense that yes this could happen again the statements coming from iran have exacerbated that feeling
2574708 much more likely than other people to desire a life in which they make a difference in the world 75 compared to the national average of 56

2574713 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2574714 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever

2574716 he may be your best mate but if shes finished with him then get right in there
2574717 you just ran out of excuses not to be successful
2574718 damien duff has been terrific for us you could be talking about seven goals pre season
2574719 hes been working very hard its the first time hes had a pre season and it shows it looked like he could run forever
2574720 the goal today is not the sort of goal you associate with damien duff but his fitness level is fantastic he has really trained hard and he is now getting his rewards
2574721 he is a combination of ability and a big heart and geordies love that
2574722 they were a good side and showed their quality they were good on the ball and comfortable from back to front
2574723 he looked sort of sweet but he doesnt hold any appeal to me
2574724 please dont feel bitter towards me i know you will but i hope that when the hurt has gone you will understand me
2574725 just because someone is so nice doesnt mean you have to be attracted to them
2574726 you dont have to answer you dont have to say anything as long as you are with me its more than enough i love you
2574727 you love a false image you dont see it now but one day you will

2574729 i will be back for you i hope when i come back i still have you i hope you will wait for me
2574730 i miss you so much i want you to know that i didnt call you because i want you to remember me to miss me
2574731 she knew it might not mean so much but it could have made a difference
2574732 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2574733 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2574734 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2574735 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2574736 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2574737 it became quite clear that things have deteriorated dramatically since around april or may
2574738 there is nobody to work the land there is nobody to produce the crops the healthy population is so absorbed in looking after the sick population that the whole productivity in many of the countries has taken a severe consequence
2574739 ive seen families that consist of maybe as many as 15 or 20 adults all sick and the house is being run by a seven year old child
2574740 theyre putting several bodies into one grave because no one has enough energy to dig another
2574741 the feeding tube isnt a regular regimen i have to do every single night
2574742 if she goes off the tube sometimes her weight goes back down again
2574743 when im at a friends house and they have a cookie ill have a banana i kind of wish i could have the cookie but i know i cant
2574744 i find it hard when shes suffering because theres nothing we can do to comfort her
2574745 when shes having cramps she doesnt want to be touched so i cant go and hug her or anything
2574746 i love helping people and figuring out why people do things
2574747 we pray for a cure every time we break a wishbone
2574748 i was moved of course like anybody else by the events of sept 11
2574749 i was wondering what would happen with all these people that died
2574750 people that are old or sick know theyre dying but this came so suddenly and suddenly they are faced with an end to this earthly life
2574751 the circle is a different dimension from where they were before and through the circle any emergency of 911 and through death people are changed
2574752 you have to go on this journey wherever it will lead you and you have to go through the light
2574753 modern society must face up to the problem that we produce too much waste
2574754 this just takes that standard to a higher level and in more parts of the world
2574755 participating in this initiative is one way of showing that nokia respects and is contributing to sustainable development
2574756 we will be aggressively encouraging people to bring in their phones
2574757 weve been proactively pursuing our own solution in anticipation of these resolutions
2574758 a public opinion poll earlier this week suggested 55 per cent of canadians would not want the law repealed
2574759 its what a journalist should ultimately strive to achieve in every story
2574760 every year i ask this every year i get the same answers from you it doesnt matter where you are from you want the answer let me tell you the ones you gave me were wrong wrong and wrong
2574761 objectivity in journalism is rubbish it is impossible to attain and add to the list the concept of balance
2574762 hey kid i dont know what youre talking about but ive been doing that for years
2574763 okay this is what i believe now i am aware of it let me look back at what information i have gathered
2574764 by the time i got him it was too late
2574765 i am seeing young people with lungs that look like theyve smoked 40 years there are big holes in them
2574766 smoking kills you as far as were concerned its not an acceptable delivery mechanism for a medicine and youre rolling it up with other substances such as tobacco and setting fire to it so youre destroying at lot of material in the process of burning it
2574767 what were trying to do is give physicians a set of eyes to augment their ears
2574768 were very early on in i think a major change in how we examine patients
2574769 we can repeat it if were not happy with the patients progress and its risk free
2574770 with this device you can get in there at the same time and scan for internal bleeding
2574771 if somebody has large amounts of internal bleeding you can detect it in seconds
2574772 if patients present shock because theyre bleeding to death then we need to find out very quickly where theyre bleeding
2574773 a patient was not suspected to have fluid around a sack of the heart and i did the ultrasound at the bedside and it was crushing it in a life threatening way
2574774 to order an echocardiogram and send the patient to the lab you were lucky if it would get done the same day usually a few hours later
2574775 the patient probably would have arrested on the floor if we had waited for the full tests
2574776 id order a different test or id cancel a test
2574777 so i think that theres the ability to really miss some major problems with the doppler so i dont trust the doppler in other words
2574778 this machine doesnt have good video capture it doesnt have strong batteries its not a perfect machine but its still incredibly useful
2574779 although its more handy its also quite heavy at the end of the day your shoulder hurts
2574780 its portable but its not as small as the stethoscope
2574781 it has the potential to augment in a tremendous way the stethoscope
2574782 the ultrasound is just another means of extending the physical senses
2574783 thats something weve all had a passion to achieve for the past few decades it could be a wearable device every physician will carry around
2574784 i think theres a definite future one of the reasons that it hasnt gained widespread acceptance is because it clearly does not replace the big machine
2574785 the reality is technology when it has very practical applications that is it helps a physician do his or her job better it improves patient outcome if it does some of those things then it becomes embraced
2574786 people were saying this new fangled cd would never happen it took a number of years to happen

donne naissance de solides pr jug s de masse un aveuglement qui notre poque est particuli rement dangereux il est universellement admis que louest montre la voie au monde entier vers le d veloppement

personne ici pr sent ne me suspectera de vouloir exprimer une critique du syst me occidental dans lid e de sugg rer le socialisme comme alternative non pour avoir connu un pays o le socialisme a t mis

ne cessent de devenir plus fermes et plus fortes bien s r une soci t ne peut rester dans des ab mes danarchie comme cest le cas dans mon pays mais il est tout aussi avilissant pour elle de rester dans

tout cela est sensible pour de nombreux observateurs partout sur la plan te le mode de vie occidental appara t de moins en moins comme le mod le directeur il est des sympt mes r v lateurs par lesquels lhistoire lance des avertissements une soci t menac e ou en p ril de tels avertissements sont en loccurrence le d clin des arts ou le manque de grands hommes detat et il arrive parfois que les signes

2574849 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2574850 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2574851 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2574852 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2574853 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2574854 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2574879 it is my particular pleasure to share this virtual podium with my distinguished colleagues the foreign secretary of the united kingdom mr david milliband and the foreign minister of malta mr michael frendo we may be thousands of miles apart in the real world but in the second life virtual world can share the same platform right here in front of the maldives virtual embassy on diplomacy island that such a thing is possible reflects the wonders of modern information technology which has the power to bring us all together no matter where we are 20 years ago the president of the maldives h e maumoon abdul gayoom warned assembled world leaders in the united nations that climate change if left unchecked would mean the death of the maldives nation and many more like it two decades later the only thing that has changed in the real world is that global warming is actually getting worse and that eco systems and people are suffering ever greater hardships to try to turn the page on these years of empty rhetoric and failed promises the maldives has organised a meeting of small island states which is intended to look at different options for turning rhetoric into action and promises into results in particular we have been discussing the human dimension of climate change this approach aims to emphasise the individual human impact of climate change we hope this initiative will provide an ethical and moral spur for world leaders meeting in december in bali to finally agree a workable and effective global agreement to halt and reverse climate change we have waited 20 years we cannot afford to wait another twenty years in the real world there is no second life
2574880 you are at the front line of the battle against climate change i think you can send not just a very clear alarm but also a very clear message to the international community
2574881 all countries in the world must live up to their responsibilities in this important area
2574882 climate change affects all of us yet our voices are not always heard on the global scale we are often faced as small countries with limited human and financial resources needed in order to articulate our position in the global diplomatic fora
2574883 senate finance committee baucus d mont and grassley r iowa are dumping all over the cayman islands they claim any american corporation with a subsidiary company offshore which is fully legal should be treated as suspect tax dodgers the baucus grassley show was based on a report the two senatorial pals ordered the government accountability office to write the senators asked this congressional watchdog agency to investigate a five story building ugland house in the caymans that is listed as the business address for corporate subsidiaries of more than 18 500 u s companies that number has nearly doubled in the past four years
2574884 about 5 percent of these 18 857 entities in the ugland house were wholly u s owned and 40 to 50 percent had a u s billing address the cayman islands reputation as a stable business friendly environment with a sound legal infrastructure also attracts business this activity is typically legal such as when pension funds and other u s tax exempt entities invest in cayman hedge funds to maximize their return
2574885 u s multi national corporations are permitted to defer u s taxes on profits from foreign business operations earned by foreign subsidiary corporations as a way to compensate for the fact that the u s is the only major country in the world that imposes tax on its corporations without regard to where the company in doing business

2574889 it may have delayed her eventual demise probably slow the cancer down but eventually she would have succumbed to this vicious cancer
2574890 the point here is that the primary tumor was treated
2574891 the bottom line is it probably does happen obviously it happens very rarely because it is the nature of cancer to grow not to regress
2574892 for the true believer or faithful this is a miracle for the true skeptic this is a random or very unusual coincidence for the doctor and scientist we call it complete spontaneous regression of cancer
2574893 im not the praying type but i just wanted to say thank you

2574901 the attacks are occurring in georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia and mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2574902 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6
2574903 whatever site is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this site is not safe and they should know this
2574904 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2574905 cynical mr saakashvili must do two things he must withdraw all forces from south ossetia and sign a legally binding document to never use force against south ossetia again

2574928 ashley was first expelled from school when he was about eight we got him into a local school who worked very very hard with him but eventually they felt that things were getting a little too disruptive
2574929 we were bandied about between lots of schools but they were not suitable for the problems he had got they were for children who were badly behaved
2574930 we finally got him into a school in chelmsley wood the headmaster there worked very very hard with him and he built up a good relationship with him but when the ofsted report came through the school was closed and when it eventually re opened the headmaster left
2574931 the new headmistress started taking in children bit by bit ashley was only there for a couple of weeks before they told us they couldnt teach him because of the problems he had
2574932 the fact hed passed his gcses for maths when he was 12 meant nothing to them
2574933 they could cater for his intelligence but not his level of disruption or they could cater for his disruptiveness but not for his intelligence they could never do both
2574934 my son was a lovely boy and im not just saying that because im his mother but he was very intelligent and the system let him down very very badly

2574941 if it came to troublemaking he was the first to join in
2574942 i played great golf fairways and greens the whole round and that was the most important thing now i have a chance for tomorrow and i cant believe it
2574943 after that i got bad and i played with not very good concentration the whole rest of the round
2574944 i couldnt come back after that 8 i made a double bogey at the 18th and then i was almost fighting after being near the lead suddenly i was trying to make the cut so i was mad the whole rest of the round
2574945 its not very enjoyable to play they have taken an okay golf course and turned it into a lot of crap thats my opinion and im sticking to it
2574946 i think there should be some tough holes but i dont think it should be i hit a perfect shot and made double bogey
2574947 youve got long rough on every hole thats the frustrating part when its completely unfair on some holes amp no a major shouldnt be like that
2574948 i think they do the most fair best setup of all the majors but i think the golf course is so hard i mean i see guys complaining and theres plenty of places you cant get close to the flag but youve got to know par is a good score on those holes i dont think its unfair i just think its really really hard
2574949 i like it very much fairways are perfect the greens are hard but they are good and the rough is a good rough you can hit some shots from there but i like the course and today i could make a very good round even with those conditions
2574950 weve looking to it for many many years and everybody is excited now and im really excited so i want to share this kind of feeling with all my american friends
2574951 chinese people are really friendly and china is really a wonderful country and we want people all the world to know more things about china and know more culture about china

2574969 all day and all night long he had a gun on each shoulder and he marched from where our store was to our home and that was back and forth all evening
2574970 its a history that has to be brought out into the open it really has to be
2574971 it is extremely important that we take time to recognize the significance of the race riots that we teach our children all about them
2574972 and that we rededicate ourselves to the notion that we must all work together to ensure that something like that never happens again

2574993 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist

2574995 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2574996 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2574997 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2574998 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2574999 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids

2575038 i lost my innocence to men i did not have any idea who they were and now all that the french government can give back is rubbish all the evidence against its soldiers
2575039 recently i heard that they want to arrest our people for whatever they accused them at least they did not rape children like their own soldiers
2575040 i was brought by interahamwes to the stadium as they beat me and white soldiers dressed in military uniform were there one pulled me by hand and took me into a tent as i resisted he slapped me hard he tore my skirt off force my legs wide and penetrated me
2575041 i felt as if a metal was penetrating me the pain was so much i screamed so hard but nobody was helping me i was bleeding i felt it would be better if i died he finished raping me and moved out
2575042 we believed we were safe after the war was ending and we had seen whites bazungu claiming to have come to protect us we knew everything was ok
2575043 i was wrong my suffering was just going to start
2575044 in the stadium kamarampaka the interahamwe took me there directly and there were many white soldiers all over i was put in a room of the tent just near by and the next thing a huge white soldier entered and closed the tent closure and undressed
2575045 i was very small he just lifted me like a baby ripped off my cloths and he started raping me
2575046 the pain was terrible i screamed till i lost my breath i was bleeding profusely then he changed and penetrated me through my mouth
2575047 around 14 being raped by one half naked french soldier as two others helped hold the victim

2575064 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2575065 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2575066 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2575067 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2575068 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2575069 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2575070 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2575071 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2575072 one through 12 we just have a really strong team
2575073 it doesnt matter who we sub in it just gets a little bit stronger and a little bit harder in different areas

2575076 it is a shame basketball is played for 40 minutes because 10 minutes wouldve been enough for us
2575077 i havent been recognized here and i dont expect to be
2575078 the men are recognized for a reason and the things they do on the basketball court are amazing im glad its not me because they get harassed although everything here has been first class
2575079 this is the door that was open to me im thankful for my opportunity to be here i knew it was somewhat of a controversial decision but i also know im doing it for the right reasons i cant live my life based on what other people think of me
2575080 the russians have been very good to me so im thankful
2575081 i still love my country this is basketball this is not world war iii or something
2575082 the history between the united states and russia is what adds a little bit of gasoline to the fire that was a long time ago were in a different generation right now im a basketball player and in the scheme of life what i do is not too incredibly important im proud of what america represents i love my country but russia has been good to me too theyve been very kind
2575083 i wouldve given my left arm to play for my country
2575084 but that was never supposed to be thats not how my story plays out

2575091 were glad its over and were hopeful the community can heal and move on
2575092 the board has made its decision and i accept it and look forward to repairing the breach
2575093 the district the board the administration has wasted far too much time and too much money on this hearing and i think we need to move forward and keep in mind our purpose to restore academic excellence to our district and our students
2575094 there was so much enthusiasm and energy in that room that day
2575095 we never realized then that we were creating an unique event one of its kind in north america
2575096 festivals like this soften the harsh image muslims are often saddled with
2575097 this is an excellent venue for people to come together and see the artistic and cultural side of islam
2575098 its nice to see people representing themselves through islamic graffiti and to promote it to be something beautiful and not something that is associated with vandalizing property
2575099 what to do if you find yourself stuck with no hope of rescue consider yourself lucky that life has been good to you so far alternatively if life hasnt been good to you so far which given your present circumstances seems more likely consider yourself lucky that it wont be troubling you much longer

2575103 because illinois is a top producing soybean state and the top state for consumption of biodiesel this promotion is a natural fit for the illinois soybean association
2575104 illinois soybean growers have a special respect for abraham lincoln and we are proud to have biodiesel displayed on the unit which displays such an important part of u s and illinois history

2575121 hes the fourth outfielder on this team but he will play trembley said
2575122 he deserves a shot he put up great humbers at bowie but this is the big leagues luke scott is playing with an achilles and a problem with his arch i will be reasonable with getting him out of there and reasonable with getting montanez in there but if people are waiting for him to play seven days in a row i dont think thats realistic
2575123 i think he montanez can swing the bat i really do but to put him in center field he played eight games in center field at bowie this is not the instructional league this is the big leagues well work with him hell get out there but to put him in center field in a bunch of unfamiliar ballparks would not be fair were going to be fair with him
2575124 it seems like hulk has smashed those questions to pieces

2575131 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2575132 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2575133 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2575134 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2575135 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2575136 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2575137 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2575138 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2575139 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2575140 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
2575141 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity

2575162 ya allah sekiranya engkau mengetahui bahawa anak perempuanku beriman denganmu dan rasulmu dan dia memelihara kehormatannya hanya untuk suaminya maka janganlah biarkan dia menjadi mangsa orang kafir dan orang zalim
2575163 ada sepuluh orang dari umat ini yang mereka telah tergolong kafir terhadap allah yang maha agung sedang mereka masih mengira bahawa mereka orang orang yang beriman
2575164 sebenarnya aku hendak masuk ke dalam masjid untuk mengganggu seorang yang sedang sembahyang tetapi aku takut kepada orang yang tidur dekat dengan orang yang sedang sembahyang ini
2575165 wahai iblis kenapa kamu tidak takut kepada orang sedang sembahyang sedang dia beribadah dan berbisik kepada allah swt dan engkau takut kepada orang yang sedang tidur sedang dia dalam keadaan lalai
2575166 apabila telah mati anak adam itu maka terhentilah amalnya melainkan tiga macam

2575180 we train them by taking them out and engaging the taliban
2575181 it was pretty frustrating because we d spent all this time mentoring them and then they were gone
2575182 until we can give the people security the ones who can effect change on the population are the taliban
2575183 we need the police to do that because we can t be everywhere at once
2575184 we re trying to get them doing the right thing so that when the ministry of the interior catches up they can hit the ground running
2575185 it s been hard at times to focus on mentoring when it s such a kinetic situation
2575186 driving around kandahar you can see a big difference between units that have been through the training and those that haven t
2575187 most of these guys come in without any training and lack basic skills
2575188 a report released by two canadian business professors days ago concluded that most recalls of toys made in china were because of design errors not manufacturing problems or the lead paint issue the report which analyzed chinese made toy recalls by going through recalls issued by the us consumer product safety commission from 1988 to august 2007 found of the 550 toy recalls 76 4 percent were due to problems that could be attributed to design flaws of the 20 million toys recalled by mattel in the past month 80 percent were because they contained small magnets which is a design flaw said the report

2575215 personally i found the book engaging hugely informative and fascinating the way a 40 car pile up or train derailment is fascinating frank makes a valiant attempt to end the book on an upbeat note but on the whole the picture he presents is like a case study in political despair
2575216 the really depressing part is that he seems to have correctly diagnosed the cancer
2575217 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down

2575303 this explains that the gang members here would first confirm the serial number of the currency notes in the chest and then inform those printing the currency to put the same serial number on the ficn
2575304 but calls to these two places were much more frequent than others
2575305 if the gang had actually pumped in the amount which is being estimated at rs 40 crore then the profits incurred thereon must be traced on the ground to establish that they were major players in the racket

2575339 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2575340 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2575341 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2575342 i am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination imagination is more important than knowledge knowledge is limited imagination encircles the world
2575343 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2575344 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2575345 but the morocco of poverty backward countryside and urban slums is increasingly averse to tourism and the internationalized elite
2575346 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2575347 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2575348 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2575349 preity will have to do her portions in toronto after her world tour with the bachchans and also attend the toronto festival screening
2575350 its the venue of all serious minded films at the toronto film festival last year the coen brothers no country for old men premiered there this year im proud to have my film there in the special representation section
2575351 it would be difficult i would imagine certainly in this country but well see how we go
2575352 ive got faith that well narrow it down and hopefully well come up with some suspects
2575353 given the environment we remain cautious in the near term looking ahead we expect revenue from it services business to be about 1 09 billion by the end of second quarter of this fiscal
2575354 rate realisation and utilisation improved sequentially by 300 basis points and 50 basis points respectively we have also won seven multi year multi million dollar deals
2575355 we want removal of n n vohra from the post of governor of the state as this will help in building a congenial atmosphere in jammu
2575356 these demands are very easy to be fulfilled without any legal or legislative implications nothing less than this will be acceptable to the people of jammu
2575357 we have chosen to address your good self in a situation where an all out repression and intimidation has been unleashed by the state government on the people of jammu to suppress their views
2575358 the central panel had come to assess the situation only and we put our demands before them patil gave an assurance that our demands would be looked into

2575390 are we truely ready to accept life from other worlds or apply our lives beliefs or understandings upon other worlds
2575391 what is our current state like through their eyes you be the judge
2575392 fascad stone this is truth man im speaking truth through and through brother there doin it again to me and this time the whole world is in deep shit man
2575393 im tellin you man they put it in there last wednesday they want to enslave me because im gonna tell the truth they are all over man every fuckin where they are in our lives theys gonna do the whole world in man your gonna see in 2013 is what their leader told me
2575394 we are going to solve this object mystery but i want you to explain this clark dont fuckin yank my chain explain the 13 murders here in virginia if your behind this your gonna earn a federal cell with the worst alien ever and his name will be bubba
2575395 listen clark i cant explain all the help you have given us over the years i know one thing dealing with your hick ass has been one wild ride for the past nine what ever is going on here is going to get solved i still dont understand or want to understand why you insist on dealing with me and this department of the fbi the only thing saving you is my director because i would have left you in that nut house rotting i know this it is now time for you to start giving the real meat here i know their mission and goals from you now it is time to start giving proof the time is now clark the time is now
2575396 man i deal with you because of a dream man your clean and all i can trust your not one of them just help me man they are wanting to make us all slaves we are talking monkies to them man they want this planet for their own they want its resources they want its inner powers i gave you those terrorist cell locations hopein you would find some clues to my claims man what about the space coordinates any word on that just know man this is real and there is no time left ok i will talk just dont put me back in that instituition man the food and nurses are terrible
2575397 well you should be pleased my son within your account is the finances you require to pay the federation of free worlds for your exiting the stellar region also i have given you funding for food and fuel to sustain you on your journey
2575398 i know you didnt have to do this but with the order of cathol failing me plus i only got 45 funding from the goverment of orion i guess the ffw and foc spent to much during the war arceology and exploration are no longer the top of the list
2575399 i believe in you son i know it pains you that i utilized some of your fathers and uncles death fund yet i believe in your journey besides the ffw does too you have discovered 25 new races 85 new species of life and three uncharted inhabitable worlds with your team since you graduated the shools of knowledge on cathol that is accomplishment i know your father would be proud even though he would have wanted you to become a warrior of orion
2575400 although i really dont understand your fascination with the life on earth in sol 3 or humans in general
2575401 our people and the races here dont understand they are the pure ones we have humans here and races of humans within the federation of free worlds amp cathol but this species is the purest even though the draconians lie and claim to have cloned them granted the race of humans we know here are of pleaden decent but they are nowhere near the capabilities of humans on the planet earth
2575402 i honestly believe their souls are the purest it is something alot of races here do not have nor understand mother i want to explore them further and find out their abilities perhaps there is much to be learned from their ways of living yes they war too but it has been recorded their wars do not last for thousands of years why because they know what forgiveness is
2575403 well according to todays findings from other explorers they are a waiste and full of hatred
2575404 you know oki if this fails you could always focus on your paintings this one is strange and nice what do you call it
2575405 i call it clark and stone i had a dream and painted it on board my teams ship last month
2575406 either way koki it looks like the universe is painting two amazing paths for you
2575407 il mio bene cos forte che ogni volta che tallontani verso la terra io ti tiro indietro per riprenderti tra le mie braccia senza te la mia vita sarebbe insignificante sarei un mare piatto senza emozione tu sei lessenza del mio esistere
2575408 legislate failure in iraq suggested today that there is little difference between the two on one question they both want to bring american troops home
2575409 the great difference is i intend to win the war first mccain told an assembly of veterans today
2575410 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure mccain said at a meeting of the disabled american veterans in las vegas
2575411 this was back when supporting americas efforts in iraq entailed serious political risk
2575412 better than most the men and women in this room know the hardships and costs of war you were there when your country needed you you shouldered heavy burdens and accepted great risks
2575413 im sure many of you will also recall from your experiences in war as i do from mine that when youre somewhere on the other side of the world in the service of america you pay attention to the news from back home
2575414 the good judment of the next president mccain told the veterans see his speech here
2575415 though victory in iraq is finally in sight a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president mccain said
2575416 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
2575417 with just three months to go before the election a lot of folks are still trying to square senator obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq
2575418 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure mccain said
2575419 this was back when supporting americas efforts in iraq entailed serious political risk
2575420 thanks to the courage and sacrifice of our soldiers sailors airmen and marines and to brave iraqi fighters the surge has succeeded
2575421 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2575422 it will also fall to the next commander in chief to make good on the obligation our government accepts every time any man or woman enters the proud ranks of the united states military and again when they receive their dd 214
2575423 the dav has defined some of these obligations in your stand up for veterans pledge
2575424 in practice veterans must be treated fairly and expeditiously as they seek compensation for disability or illness
2575425 as president i will do all that is in my power to ensure that those who serve today and those who have served in the past have access to the highest quality health mental health and rehabilitative care in the world
2575426 im not here to tell you that there is a cost that is too high to be paid in the care of our nations veterans
2575427 exactly because funding va programs command bipartisan support some in the congress like to attach unrelated appropriations and earmarks to va bills
2575428 when we make it clear to congress that no earmark bill will be signed into law that will save many billions of dollars that can be applied to essential priorities and above all the care of our veterans
2575429 my administration will create a veterans care access card to be used by veterans with illness or injury incurred during their military service and by those with lower incomes
2575430 this card is not intended to either replace the va or privatize veterans health care as some have wrongly charged
2575431 even so there are veterans eligible for care who are not currently able to receive it on account of distance wait times or the absence of certain specialties and for this group the new card i propose will offer better alternatives to provide the benefits they have earned
2575432 reform must also recognize that greater care is needed for certain types of injuries
2575433 the va must also broaden its care for the women who are entering the armed forces in greater numbers than ever
2575434 all reforms bring change and even the best changes can be a little unsettling what you should know about this reform is that it is an extension of the current system not a replacement as a matter of duty and of honor whatever our commitments to veterans cost those commitments will be kept
2575435 the next president will have many responsibilities to the american people and i take them all seriously
2575436 it is every veterans hope that should their children be called upon to answer a call to arms the battle will be necessary and the field well chosen
2575437 many of them have served multiple tours in iraq and afghanistan
2575438 amor ya he salido destinado a cibeles 28 d as m ximos para vernos nos veremos en unos 25 d as te amo ya s es oficial

2575444 recuerdo que siempre ten a hambre al final me internaron en un hospital en el sur de verona donde luch contra la fiebre tifoidea que me provoc la malnutrici n desnudo en una cama durante un a o
2575445 le cost dos a os encontrarme en aquella pandilla de delincuentes hab amos salido del tirol y acabamos en calabria
2575446 y mam decidi que nos fu ramos a am rica porque ella ten a all un hermano
2575447 la ciencia de la calle siempre he pensado que lo que aprend entonces con aquellos ladronzuelos me sirvi despu s como investigador una cierta intuici n del porvenir

2575453 calculamos que 69 millones de aves est n en riesgo las dificultades se observan especialmente en las plantas av colas del valle del cauca eje cafetero y santander donde comenz a escasear la materia prima para fabricar alimentos balanceados
2575454 gran parte de las compa as que representamos importan ma z y soya para transformarlos en alimento para animales pero no han podido movilizar la carga desde buenaventura porque los transportadores que deciden hacerlo son atacados en el camino el temor es tal que los conductores prefieren guardar los veh culos incluso cargados lo que empeora la situaci n
2575455 el riesgo mayor est en el sector av cola y la porcicultura y con menor incidencia en la ganader a de leche y la piscicultura
2575456 esperamos que la protecci n que ofrece el gobierno a los transportadores que decidan movilizar los productos nos permita normalizar las operaciones en los pr ximos d as
2575457 incluso veh culos peque os han sido atacados con piedras esto hace que adem s del riesgo para los animales vivos tambi n se ponga en juego la salubridad de los consumidores ante la demora en el despacho del producto
2575458 entendemos la voluntad y disposici n de las autoridades hemos trabajado con ellos y nos han ayudado pero nosotros movemos demasiada carga por lo que a n no hemos podido normalizar el suministro de pollo en los grandes centros de consumo
2575459 hacemos un llamado a quienes convocaron el paro para que no pongan en juego la alimentaci n de los colombianos ni las condiciones de seres vivos como los pollos y gallinas que tambi n merecen respeto
2575460 estamos con buena parte de los veh culos parados hemos intentado viajar pero hay conductores atacando a sus propios compa eros esta situaci n puede volverse insostenible en los pr ximos d as por eso es necesaria una concertaci n entre los camioneros y el gobierno que permita poner fin al paro

2575493 the market is simple reflecting the fundamentals of supply and demand markets participants are considering the world slowdown the deterioration in expectations for the growth worldwide
2575494 psychologists norbert hagemann bernd strauss and jan leibing from the university of munster specifically found that referees tended to assign more points to tae kwon do competitors dressed in red than those dressed in blue
2575495 a rational electorate is reluctant to support someone who does not exhibit commitment to some ideology
2575496 voters rightly perceive that someone without ideological commitment cannot have developed a valuable political program
2575497 the central objective of the governments program is to tackle poverty and inequality by improving access to health and education programs for poor and underserved groups this is a very wise investment and the world bank is pleased to support it
2575498 any long or awkward step which the cleaver has plenty of by now would cause me to cramp so i descended cautiously to muir by which time i had lost all but 1 minute of the lead i had gained on justin merles pace i descended the unfortunately still firm muir snowfield reaching pebble neck and neck with justins time then battling the rocky stepped trail i commenced below glacier vista i kicked breaking away from the pace opted for the more direct east side of alta vista complete with skin shredding steep asphalt descent and reached the trailhead in 4 46 29
2575499 if nothing else with four children i should probably play the lottery
2575500 its kind of like saying theres a bunch of money on the street if you can get over there soon enough you can get it
2575501 its something the industry is taking seriously youd be in a bad place if you werent doing something about it
2575502 you can bet that the internet providers are going to stay tightlipped about any attacks on their networks
2575503 i could force you to download child porn or send subversive material to china
2575504 the exploitation is almost limitless google has to fix it
2575505 it turns out a lot of people who develop these things arent good at security
2575506 weve been telling google about these vulnerabilities for years and they have not made corrective actions
2575507 they chose to open the doors and insomuch put a lot of consumers at risk
2575508 if nothing else with four children i should probably play the lottery
2575509 its like saying once you get into willy wonkas chocolate factory and youre in the garden where everythings edible you have it all

2575524 the song was a hit and the words lynch and racism has never come up until this moron wrote this blog
2575525 colberts studio audience clapped to the beat blithely unaware that they were swaying to a racially tinged explicitly pro lynching anthem that calls for the vigilante style hanging of car thieves and other assorted evildoers
2575526 grandpappy told my pappy back in my day son a man had to answer for the wicked that hed done take all the rope in texas find a tall oak tree round up all of them bad boys hang them high in the street
2575527 there is bunch of weird stuff going on out there right now
2575528 i could force you to download child porn or send subversive material to china
2575529 the exploitation is almost limitless google has to fix it
2575530 it turns out a lot of people who develop these things arent good at security
2575531 at fragapalooza your opponent could be sitting right next to you across the row or across the room as opposed to across the country
2575532 a lan party usually consists of three or four of your friends in your basement playing computer games against each other
2575533 we wanted to increase the size and get more people involved
2575534 there is bunch of weird stuff going on out there right now
2575535 how do you force a server to 1 badguy com
2575536 oh let me count the ways god its good to be finally able to talk about this stuff
2575537 i cant necessarily attack facebook or myspace but i can attack their users all day long
2575538 dont put anything on a facebook account that you dont consider public
2575539 every time they do that they are showing an implicit trust in whoever wrote the application and most people dont know who that is
2575540 social networks really dont care if you get pawned or not
2575541 people know if they go on a computer and download a program they could get a virus they dont have the same view of how dangerous that can be on a social networking site
2575542 once the content is moved from their site they have no control over that
2575543 los que sobreviven a los desastres no son las mas fuertes sino los mejor preparados
2575544 and as such we rallied around each other for support
2575545 we really were surprised at the level of trust we found
2575546 against barbarity poetry can resist only by confirming its attachment to human fragility like a blade of grass growing on a wall while armies march by
2575547 i thought poetry could change everything could change history and could humanize and i think that the illusion is very necessary to push poets to be involved and to believe
2575548 but now i think that poetry changes only the poet
2575549 i am still not a poet and sometimes i regret i chose this way
2575550 i was very strongly influenced by al mutanabbi and the mahjar poets emigrant poets such a kahlil gibran and modern arab poets such as qabbani al sayyab
2575551 garcia lorca pablo neruda yeats and today derek walcott is probably my favorite poet i also like the polish poets especially symborska
2575552 i do not like the label it is a burden
2575553 although i might realize that the harshest exile is in my homeland
2575554 we should not justify suicide bombers we are against the suicide bombers but we must understand what drives these young people to such actions they want to liberate themselves from such a dark life it is not ideological it is despair
2575555 give us back our house but live in our garden in our living room
2575556 the palestinian people feel that they are living the hours before dawn their national will is stronger in reaction to the challenge they do not have another option but to continue to carry the hope that they are going to have a normal life
2575557 right but if i gave you anchovies then you could throw a fit
2575558 tony scholes is over in spain speaking to the player at the moment but that doesnt mean he will be signing for us
2575559 he is a player with great pedigree and has an outstanding goalscoring record but he isnt the only player we are looking at
2575560 amdy is with us because he is a player who has plenty of top flight experience after playing for portsmouth and newcastle
2575561 he is with us for five days and any business we do with the lad will be conducted between stoke city football club and charlton athletic
2575562 we are looking at some options at the moment three or four different options about the strike department which we hope will come to a happy conclusion
2575563 hopefully we will have someone in for the start of the season
2575564 they everton only play with one up front away and at home really so you had four strikers playing for one place which was quite difficult
2575565 yak aiyegbeni yakubu was the main guy up front and i was playing off him sometimes a little bit deeper on the wings and that hindered me
2575566 i didnt really settle and had quite a lot of injuries the one up front formation limited the amount of games i played i was out on the right and didnt really get going
2575567 crowd violence racism a kidnapping stadium bans and financial problems marred bulgarian soccer last season
2575568 we would split the 150 000 between at least 37 people possibly more that means that each team member would receive about 4 054 before taxes after taxes theyd each receive about 2 878 or 575 per game there are mens amateur teams in chicago that will pay you as well as that
2575569 a coffin outside the park waited for the corpse of the timbers opponents and bitter rivals the seattle sounders
2575570 you have to be very organized in the back and know where brandon swartzendruber gustavo oliveira and jeremy gold are at all times
2575571 you cannot give those guys any room you also need to match them emotionally they are a team that plays with a lot of heart and emotion they try to send messages with crushing tackles but they border on that line of being aggressive and being sent off
2575572 if one of the member states undergoes an aggression from any state or a group of states it would be viewed as an aggression against all states of this treaty
2575573 we know about zeltsers state of health from the press reports and we have brought up this issue in the foreign ministry of belarus
2575574 e zeltser constantly complains about his health he says that its difficult for him to walk upstairs to the court building and police guards carry him in arms to the third floor
2575575 i am sure that he will never surrender if he wanted he would have done that long ago even if they come close he would not be caught alive that i can guarantee i know his current of thoughts and i am sure he would rather put a pistol to his head then arrested
2575576 i am not sure he rented apartments in new belgrade i am not sure he is in serbia at all the family does not know were he is hiding i suppose he left the country long ago and is far away in a safe place i do not exclude he is somewhere in russia or belarus
2575577 information about person who testify in the court is not provided
2575578 the official insists that the real purposes of the movement are political whereas the charter defines it as a human rights organization and the real purposes do not meet the requirements of regulations
2575579 that is that the court found the ministry wrong in all other respects
2575580 well continue our attempts to obtain legal status with a view to showing our intention to act within the bounds of law
2575581 this time we are not just told to read laws
2575582 this was the case before and we just didnt know what we should correct now we have been given specific proposals about what must be changed and a deadline for this i guess we are on track to obtain legal status and registration for the movement for freedom
2575583 its the dawn of the 21st century wheres my air car wheres my moon base
2575584 russia may have provoked this crisis and one may be properly critical of indeed deplore many aspects of recent russian policy in the caucasus or the ukraine but the immediate responsibility for this crisis must be borne by tbilisi
2575585 in short it looks more and more as though georgia has fallen in to its enemies trap the script went like this first mount unbearable provocations then wait for a response and finally reply with overwhelming military force and diplomatic humiliation
2575586 in recent years the kremlin had escalated its interference in georgias territories of abkhazia and south ossetia bombing georgian territory twice last year illegally extending russian citizenship to residents there and appointing russian security officers to their self declared governments south ossetias government in particular is practically under moscows direct control with little if any ability to act independently but this flare up is a direct consequence of russias deliberate and recent efforts to engage its small neighbor in military conflict in april russias president vladimir putin signed a decree effectively beginning to treat abkhazia and south ossetia as parts of the russian federation this land grab was a particularly galling move because russia is in charge of both the peacekeeping operations in the conflict zones and the negotiations over their political resolution the mediator had now clearly become a direct party to the conflict moscow then sent paratroopers heavy weapons and other troops into abkhazia although these measures constituted military occupation of georgian territory georgia failed to respond militarily instead with european aspirations in mind georgian leaders listened to western calls for restraint and put their faith in half hearted western diplomatic initiatives
2575587 as i say theres plenty to dislike about recent russian policy but one thing might also be worth remembering the osettians and the abkhazians want to be russian not georgian this may seem daft or incomprehensible to many people but there it is anyway and one might think it something worth mentioning from time to time even if clearly its also an inconvenient truth
2575588 or the wisdom of mccains emphasis on drilling and nuking the nation out of its energy mess
2575589 to my mind such events are useful as they give a possibility to inform representatives of certain international structures foundations governmental and non governmental organisations about the events in this or that problematic country
2575590 we are helping belarus a lot for instance we have held three seminars
2575591 zeltser cannot take part in the process in this condition
2575592 e zeltser constantly complains about his health he says that its difficult for him to walk upstairs to the court building and police guards carry him in arms to the third floor
2575593 the body of the person who had been taking medicines all his life and who is not given pills now is simply dying slowly
2575594 considering cautious positions of the eu in issues of cooperation with belarus
2575595 if we can put forward a solution to the regions problems in which the eu is interested then the ban on meetings with belarusian officials interferes with the settlement of the european unions internal problems
2575596 zeltser cannot take part in the process in this condition
2575597 it is very difficult to give an opinion when the trial is held in a secret regime lawyers cannot tell much and observers are not admitted to the court there are great doubts that everything is done in compliance with the law the fact that zeltser cannot walk to the court himself because of his state of health shows that he cannot take part in the trial the man is seriously ill and his health is more important for him now that the events in the court as a result of physical suffering he cannot take part in his own defense adequately under such conditions there are more and more doubts that zeltsers rights would be defended and due process of law would be guaranteed
2575598 e zeltser constantly complains about his health he says that its difficult for him to walk upstairs to the court building and police guards carry him in arms to the third floor
2575599 inviting persons who are subordinate or in any other kind of dependency on them activities for ones nomination carried out during ones during working hours
2575600 you do not have any bigger friends than belarus in europe
2575601 we will continue conducting our policy the way we have in the last 10 to 15 years we will be your strong support im saying this publicly today
2575602 do everything for the chinese people so that you can represent your interests on the continent worthily
2575603 we have already passed through repressions intimidations prisons so they wont stop us by these methods boycott 2008 campaign is gathering pace every day and we will tie up the loose ends in any case
2575604 congress didnt have a moral right to vote out leader of the party
2575605 the bsdp h congress was n accurately well planned performance most of the delegates of the congress were supporters of anatol lyaukovich it is still interesting to me why i hadnt been recognized a delegate of the congress i didnt have a right to vote though i am a direct representative of kazulin there was a very interesting completely incomprehensible system of participants selection besides lyaukovichs speech at the congress contained many against alyaksandr kazulin and me personally he was speaking using clich s of the state run belarusian tv though i have always said im not a politician but just a daughter of a political prisoner who is seeking her fathers release when speaking i warned social democrats about the following thing the congress does not have a moral right to voted kazulin out at least because he is imprisoned he is imprisoned for all of us he couldnt give battle to those pseudo politicians who staged that farce i told them that kazulin should be released and then election should take place nevertheless kazulin has been voted out and now he is a common member of the party i have said to everyone that by that decision lyaukovich had let down not only himself but the whole party and the party that has let down its imprisoned chairman will be a pariah all over the world its a pity lyaukovich has crossed up people with good reputation including myachyslau hryb there is an impression that as long as kazulins rating is growing constantly they have staged intended lowering of his status it is possible that lyaukovich had a secret understanding with the regime as it is the regime for which the situation is beneficial
2575606 there are already many people who could be belarus presidents
2575607 will you stand in the election for the 4th term
2575608 there is almost no way we can imagine a return to the status quo
2575609 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2575610 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for the end of the russian bombings
2575611 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2575612 they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives are being lost and others are in danger
2575613 the campaign is carried out peacefully in a quiet manner without any incidents which makes one sad after all even our usual complainants are silent
2575614 there are no setbacks or emergency situations in the electoral process have been documented
2575615 the only thing is there are complaints about problems of collection of signatures in support of nomination of candidates for deputy in cities
2575616 we recommended the executive committees to work on that day they worked and received documents
2575617 maybe it is quiet in the offices of lazovik and yarmoshyna but the situation is different with us
2575618 almost every day we receive information about detentions of our representatives by law enforcing agencies and that our activists are summoned to appear in the kgb
2575619 one could agree that the campaign is carried out silently in a sense that this topic is almost absent in the state run mass media
2575620 in the first half of the year belarus adverse balance is more than 6 bn dollars it could nudge to talks on common currency in order to zero out this balance
2575621 no reasons connected to the constitution not to introduce the single currency
2575622 the eu lives with a common currency without a constitution
2575623 the contract has been signed to abrogate this agreement would be very dangerous there is no other gas supplier
2575624 next year the price of gas for belarus will be set at 80 percent of the price for poland minus custom duties and transit costs the price will clearly hover above 200
2575625 this year the gas costs 320 ths cu meters to poland the price of the next year will exceed 400
2575626 belarus is on the right way the list of enterprises reincorporate as joint stock companies has been published already the best counterbalance to growing gas and oil prices is attraction of foreign and in particular russian investment
2575627 ploughboy noticed by belarusian bloggers a 600 dollar hermes belt easily recognised by a belt buckle hit the eye
2575628 perfect calf leather legendary h letter on the buckle as a sign of style good taste power and flourishing there are analogous variants for women classic colours sandy black claret price about 18 700 russian rubles
2575629 initially the bsdp h congress was prepared as a technical one
2575630 its immoral to beat a political prisoner in a cage who cannot respond i know kazulin as a courageous and proud person i think he wont stay in such a party i have stated today that i am against considering this question at the congress i am not going to leave the party right now i joined it in 1991 and not because i joined persons like lyaukovich it is obvious that under the current leadership in the party it would be impossible to be an opponent and use some levers the congress was held with numerous violations tricks and manipulations nomination of candidates was non transparent sometimes we here in minsk didnt know that sessions for nomination of candidates had taken place in the regions already to leave kazulin without a party is advantageous only for the regime volha kazulina reasonably asked members of the party at the congress are you the opposition that asked lukashenka not to release kazulin
2575631 my belarusian counterpart and i will hold a meeting soon
2575632 we will touch upon energy and financial issues a possibility of providing belarus with an additional credit is also being considered
2575633 to study the issue in a comprehensive manner and prepare a report
2575634 on the one hand the recording by mekh in the office of mr halashka has undoubtedly shown the politically motivated character of the dismissal the case has become widely discussed by independent media and in peoples rumours
2575635 having learnt about alexander solzhenitsyns death i went to my bookshelves and looked at the three volume the gulag archipelago i had bought in 1998 because both my grandfathers paternal and maternal were victims of stalins terror undoubtedly solzhenitsyn will remain in the history as an author of the gulag archipelago as a writer i would even say as a historian who revealed the world the truths about events in the soviet empire under stalins rule to be fair i must say that the first person to say the world about the crimes of bolshevism at those times was belarusian frantishak alyakhnovich a famous playwright gulag prisoner sentenced to o10 years in solovki but it was changed for politician and enlightener branislau tarashkevich prisoner of polish jails in 1933 frantishak alyakhnovich wrote a book in clutches of the state political directorate the soviet secret police published in 7 languages in europe and the united states with due respect to solzhenitsyn i can say that he was a man of imperial views we remember his work rebuilding russia in which he denied independence of belarus and ukraine
2575636 of course death of alexander solzhenitsyn is a great grief whatever attitude towards him exists we should remember that he was one of the people who revealed us the truth everyone was afraid to know when i was about 14 i read one day in the life of ivan denisovich for the first time it seems i understood little but it was the first signal in my life saying something was wrong in the life we lived solzhenitsyn was a test for the society we see now how people say solzhenitsyn was a great person but lets remind how solzhenitsyn was hunted in 1960 70ies who meetings of condemnation were held how the country branded him why then did no one except for rostropovich who sheltered him defend him why is happening so it means that something goes wrong in the society that raises people on the shield and overthrows them from the shield and then raises them again it means that our society is immature i have a critical attitude to the last stage of alexander solzhenitsyns oeuvre i didnt understand and dont understand now his views of the russian empire his viewing belarus as russias appendix he regarded ukraine in the same way as a matter of fact he has become a basis for a new wave of the russian chauvinism however i admit he is a great man who did much for us in his time he opened our eyes
2575637 in my view we lost a man who influenced greatly formation of not only all classes of the population but also careers of many people i read the life of ivan denisovich in 1984 for the first time the book shocked me i think this novel is one of the strongest works written in those times solzhenitsyn could easily switch between artistic and historic his historical prose contains high artistic sense and his artistic searches always posses civil sense influencing readers one may have different attitudes towards political views of alexander solzhenitsyn but he was a man with very tough and clear position if speaking about the scale of a personality people of such level are lack in russia and in the world if speaking about solzhenitsyn as a writer we may say one of the last authors of great style has left us
2575638 arce for his creativity and a special status in arab and poetic scene world
2575639 i am an arab and scored no 50 thousand cards
2575640 in the fifties of the twentieth century safer we arabs could be a weapon of poetry and the poem to be clear and direct
2575641 a land without a people for a people without land
2575642 and the white red white flag is one of the most important ideas of the belarusian popular front party
2575643 the reason for that is today he is a victim and tomorrow any of us it looks like people have accepted all possible concessions to the authorities they agreed to transfer 50 000 br each in july and the same sum in august 4 2008 for the festival dazhinki multiply that by 5 000 businessmen
2575644 congress didnt have a moral right to vote out leader of the party
2575645 one of the leading opposition political forces in the country
2575646 struggle of personal ambitions for mythical power in close circle of as it would seem associates
2575647 when a party leader is in prison his deputies shouldnt settle personal issues
2575648 i dont want to call it a treachery but it looks like it
2575649 in due course ambitions for leadership came over anatol lyaukovich methods of intrigues and backstage struggle have won
2575650 i havent made such proposals to hold such a meeting a year ago the democratic forces named their conditions for holding possible negotiations with the authorities of belarus in particular release of political prisoners end of political repressions and crackdown on the independent press the new wave of political prisoners a harsh crackdown on peaceful mass rallies and so on was a refusal of the authorities
2575651 irresponsible statements about unconditional readiness of european organisations and countries to start a dialogue with lukashenka convince him of his impunity and become one of the reasons of repressions rise
2575652 i call on the belarusian authorities to suspend any further examination of this draft and its entry into force
2575653 once this legislation comes into force it will restrict freedom of information in the country even further especially when it comes to electronic media and will extend the power of the authorities to interfere with media activities in a way which is contrary to european standards
2575654 what is more even before its entry into force the new draft law is bound to have a chilling effect of self censorship on the media given the forthcoming parliamentary elections this gives particular and acute cause for concern
2575655 dissemination of unreliable information which can damage state or public interests
2575656 in fact my director hanna tarkan told me to leave work earlier for several days she was doing that on purpose and later she told that i was absent from work without good reason it was a trick against me earlier she complained herself that the administration was pressurizing her demanding to dismiss me and now before the elections she has to fulfil this demand
2575657 to get more factual message about belarus across as opposed to the image created by world media
2575658 we were to meet with belarusian colleagues as soon as possible without losing any time
2575659 belarus and russia are squeeze by the agreement of 1994 on pullout of nuclear weapons from the territory of belarus which guarantor was the us nobody can violate anti nuclear agreement but issues connected to the anti missile actions could be considered
2575660 possible deploying of missile complexes iskander in belarus about possible deploying of strategic bombers in belarus kaliningrad and so on
2575661 im happy to get the first race jitters sort of out
2575662 the first race is probably one of the most important ones getting it out of your system im pretty satisfied with that time i didnt think i was going to be that fast
2575663 sandeep never mentioned about work pressure the option of transfer to some other project available to any executive in the company was open to him
2575664 our work culture which revolves around good work life balance is our unique selling point usp
2575665 this helps the organisation to know about the negative aspects of its working apart from sorting out the aggrieved employees problem
2575666 my friends son was working for big co a and moved to big co b in big co a he got 3 promotions in 2 years and then when he went to big co b he got another promotion with a 30 salary hike he was making 2 5lakhs when he joined big co a and now he is making 8 lakhs

2575970 these criminals are never brought to justice because police and government authorities are either involved or they cant handle the crimes
2575971 with criminals and warlords in the political scene we cannot expect justice to be served
2575972 in many cases of violence against children there is a sense of impunity people continue to violate childrens rights without any sense of feeling that they will be held accountable

2575974 in all our meetings with children it takes a lot of time to make them smile that to me shows that there is not happiness in their hearts

2575976 we have found that perspective can influence your interpretation of past events in a situation in which change is likely we find that observing yourself as a third person looking at yourself from an outside observers perspective can help accentuate the changes youve made more than using a first person perspective
2575977 when participants recalled past awkwardness from a third person perspective they felt they had changed and were now more socially skilled
2575978 that led them to behave more sociably and appear more socially skilled to the research assistant
2575979 it takes a great deal of ability and skill to stay focused on the task at hand
2575980 the difference is that these types of goals are much more under the control of the athlete

2576013 no one will ever know if these tragic events could have been prevented if morris iemma had implemented the recommendations handed to him in 2003
2576014 morris iemma claims mental health is a priority but this report exposes his lack of action over 4 years
2576015 morris iemma was handed recommendations in 2003 as health minister to fix the mental health system and he failed to act
2576016 this report has painted a very worrying picture of an overburdened mental health system with immense under resourcing pressures which have contributed to fatalities
2576017 amongst its most worrying findings the committee concluded that pressure on beds may have led to the premature release of three patients who later committed homicide
2576018 the committee also found there remain significant resource issues inhibiting provision of effective mental health care within nsw p 14
2576019 this report again highlights the incompetence of minister for health reba meagher who sat on this report for months withholding information from the public
2576020 the iemma government has abandoned some of the most vulnerable people in our society and in doing so has placed lives at risk
2576021 inadequate resourcing of nsws mental health system is preventing health professionals from providing the highest standard of care
2576022 the resource pressures mean that the focus is on medicating the mentally ill and sending them back out into the community with insufficient time to provide psychological treatment and ongoing care
2576023 an horrific case reported by the committee was of a woman suffering from severe post natal depression who had been under the care of the mental health services who killed her six month old baby after receiving limited postnatal follow up following her initial treatment
2576024 it is no surprise that under these inadequate conditions there is also an issue with retention of staff the committee found
2576025 with nearly one in five australians affected by some form of mental illness every year the iemma government cannot continue to neglect this vital area of health
2576026 it is time the iemma government stopped paying lip service to mental health and started putting patients first by providing the resources necessary for mental health workers to do their job
2576027 more than 3 million australians to benefit from increased support prime minister the hon john howard mp i am pleased to announce today that a re elected coalition government will ensure older australians people with disabilities and carers share in the benefits of australias strongly growing economy the package i announce today recognises that while our economy is strong there are some australians not enjoying all the opportunities delivered by our current growth and prosperity it is the responsibility of government to ensure they are not left behind a re elected coalition government will allocate 4 billion to increase the utilities allowance paid to older australians in receipt of income support to meet basic household bills like power and gas from march 2008 the utilities allowance will increase from 107 20 to 500 a year for a single and 500 a year for a couple this will benefit more than 2 million australians extend the utilities allowance for the first time to more than 120 000 carer payment recipients regardless of age in recognition of the vital role that carers play in our society and the financial and emotional burden they carry extend the utilities allowance to more than 700 000 disability support pensioners more than double the seniors concession allowance to 500 which will particularly benefit self funded retirees people who have worked hard made sacrifices and saved diligently for their retirement the allowance recognises that most self funded retirees do not receive the concessions on energy rates and motor vehicle registration that pensioners receive around a quarter of a million self funded retirees will benefit from the increase from june 2008 these increases are in addition to the bonuses provided in previous budgets they do not preclude consideration of further bonuses as economic conditions allow a re elected coalition government will provide pensioners with greater peace of mind that their incomes will keep pace with increases of the items that make up their household budget the coalition will guarantee that if living costs for pensioners increase faster than general inflation or wages pensions will be topped up to ensure that pensioners are fully compensated for increases in the cost of living the coalition is committed to investing in initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address the effects of climate change earlier this year the government announced it would implement a national emissions trading scheme one of the inevitable impacts of a low carbon economy is we will have to pay higher electricity and other charges a re elected coalition government will use some of the proceeds of the climate change fund to lessen the impact on pensioners and other low income households of the move to a carbon constrained world the increased assistance to more people is possible only because of the strong economy the coalition has delivered to australians funding is included in the mid year economic fiscal outlook
2576028 should be marked down as one of the great feats of economic ignorance it shows he does not understand economic policy it also reveals that deep down labor has never accepted the decision to have an independent central bank with an inflation target
2576029 interest rates will always be lower under a coalition government than under a labor party
2576030 it also reveals that deep down labor has never accepted the decision to have an independent central bank with an inflation target
2576031 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2576032 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2576033 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2576034 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2576035 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2576036 oh yes i think id like to do try that
2576037 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2576038 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2576039 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2576066 from the unions perspective all should keep in mind the principal purpose of drug testing is deterrence

2576087 and to have an understanding of what the communitys needs are and how what they do can affect and better the community they live in
2576088 this is great that they decided to do this for us

2576115 when you say soa no longer matters its everything that soa enables that matters i totally think thats right because soa is a way to achieve certain things from an architecture and an alignment and agility point of view

2576220 we have made the running game a point of emphasis and i am pleased with the progress we have shown theres too many missed opportunities on both sides of the ball but just with the first scrimmage i was pleased i think we managed the clock fairly well well get better at that every time we practice

2576226 per me limportante era vedere il miglioramento di determinati movimenti di gioco tutti hanno fatto una buona prestazione ed il fatto che i ragazzi hanno preso sul serio la partita molto confortante abbiamo mantenuto i programmi della vigilia con alcuni giocatori in campo per circa unora questa sera ho fatto alcune variazioni nellassetto tattico della squadra per esempio continua colantuono ho schierato migliaccio in un ruolo diverso dal solito adatto a ragionare e non a correre troppo e questo per non farlo stancare budan sono contento per il gol che ha realizzato e ancora lontano dalla forma migliore e per questo deve continuare a lavorare tanto lui un patrimonio della societ ma non dobbiamo commettere lerrore di accelerare i tempi di recupero sono tuttavia contento per tutti bene nel primo tempo mentre nel secondo comera naturale che fosse il ritmo della gara leggermente diminuito

2576229 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
2576230 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
2576231 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
2576232 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

2576248 the science of fear elegantly weaves academic research and everyday experience exposing the secrets of emotion and reason and the essential roles they play on our lives an excellent book
2576249 where writers such as richard dawkins christopher hitchens and francis wheen have been content largely to enumerate the errors of less rational men and women dan gardner has collated part of what we need to diagnose the problem if skeptics spent less time moaning about the propensity of their fellows to believe what they want to believe and more time asking why they do so there might not be such a crisis of reason in the west today
2576250 excellent analyses everything from the medias predilection for irrational scare stories to the cynical use of fear by politicians pushing a particular agenda gardner never falls into the trap of becoming frustrated and embittered by the waste and needless worry that he is documenting a personal anecdote about an unwise foray into a nigerian slum in search of a stolen wallet disposes of the idea that the author is immune to the foibles he describes what could easily have been a catalogue of misgovernance and stupidity instead becomes a cheery corrective to modern paranoia
2576251 those of us who spend our careers in research hope that someone like daniel gardner will come along and bring our findings to the world in an engaging and scientifically accurate way thank you dan some books can change the world this one might
2576252 fear needs a science and daniel gardner offers a fast paced tour of what the most interesting researchers have revealed the number of things that you dont need to be afraid of is encouraging but finding out why we still do fear them anyway is fascinating essential reading for anyone interested in the social mistakes we make everyday and how to fix them
2576253 an invaluable resource for anyone who aspires to think clearly
2576254 elegantly summarises the results of psychological research gardner is forensic in his dissection of bogus claims in advertising and politics just as he is lucid about the science explaining why they work

2576270 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2576271 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2576272 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2576273 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2576274 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2576275 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2576276 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack

2576289 the territorial integrity of georgia is currently being violated on an enormous scale
2576290 there are bombardments civilians are dying foreign military forces are on georgian territory
2576291 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central europe

2576316 i had to camp behind my neighbors house in her yard for over a month i had a brand new baby girl and i was really scared i didnt know what to do health care for the homeless came to my neighbors yard and checked on us
2576317 my children needed shelter from the elements they needed hot meals and showers
2576318 when i was trying to rent rooms i was always told i had too many people in my family and they wouldnt rent to me
2576319 not only was there not a problem but we were welcomed my kids eat three meals a day and with the way the bathrooms are i can get them all showered at once they also have a cool place during the day my newborn is well and growing soon she is going to be three months old
2576320 there is a safe place for them to play and soon they will be going to school the school bus will be picking them up in front of the shelter and joy junction provided school supplies for all of the kids here

2576325 joy junction is the only place that helped shelter me and my kids my children jose luis jonathan kevin joselyn jaclyn edgar oscar and dianara along with my spouse raul are very grateful for joy junction because our family can stay together
2576326 despite all the recent trials this family has endured they remain close and happy mom takes diligent care of the children while her husband works all day doing paint and body work on wrecked cars the children ranging from 16 years old on down all help by watching the younger ones getting all the trays at each meal and playing with each other the older children also volunteer to do chores for the shelter

2576329 the way i paint is different than the way most people paint

2576339 the right people who could appreciate and enjoy this type of work
2576340 they kind of mingle among themselves and they dont bother anybody
2576341 some of them have left because they dont like slaughterhouses but a lot of them have decided to stay for now

2576360 we probably had 80 percent of those that were angry

2576362 while something is legal does not necessarily make it right and also does not make it something that i want to participate in
2576363 this country was founded on religious beliefs and the freedom to have those beliefs
2576364 for someone to interfere with that or make me feel like what my doctor is saying is not right is wrong
2576365 and that was my biggest issue that her morals were better than mine or her world trumped my world that was really uncomfortable

2576374 theres just no way he could do it they just grabbed a convenient person

2576425 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough
2576426 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public
2576427 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2576428 i have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so will have nothing more to say
2576429 increasingly theyre starting to recognize themselves more as iraqis instead of sectarian designations that theyve had in the past

2576431 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2576432 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees
2576433 our partnership with brussels airlines is particularly good for the clients of both airline companies as our route networks essentially are complementary as opposed to overlapping airbaltic has an excellent range of products in terms of flights to cis countries baltic countries and regional centres in scandinavia while brussels airlines offers attractive destinations in africa

2576444 shipments in the business jet and turboprop segments continue to rise steadily
2576445 expanding worldwide markets are having a very positive affect on the turbine segments of our industry
2576446 although total shipments in the piston segment are down for the first half of 2008 we believe recent success of the worlds premier general aviation show in oshkosh wisconsin is a good indicator of sustained enthusiasm for the light end of the market
2576447 the experimental aircraft association reported that attendance at last weeks airventure held steady despite uncertainty with fuel prices and strength of the north american economy the energy surrounding the entire spectrum of general aviation remains robust our piston manufacturers continue to generate excitement through new product introductions that incorporate innovative technologies and are paying increased attention to growth opportunities in the international market

2576466 i understand that its a fraternity that theres stuff involved but nobody expects to give their life for something like that
2576467 it was confusing to me how anybody can say you can be charged in connection with your own hazing
2576468 my understanding is that if probable cause is found theyll have to investigate and we wont have to speculate any further what motivates the police department or the district attorneys office to not pursue the matter

2576490 were not party to this correspondence at all we dont comment on leaked letters but its obvious that the congregation has been misinformed
2576491 the holy see would be deeply grateful to the authorities at the university of oxford were they to assist in these latter stages of the investigation by postponing the arrangement whereby the licence for greyfriars is to be returned to oxford university imminently
2576492 championing the request of the fellows and lecturers that other alternatives be examined prior to implementing fr james bonors decision to close greyfriars the fellows and lecturers hope that these discussions in rome will prove fruitful for the future of greyfriars oxford
2576493 the order is not in a position to cede to the request of the fellows the university made it perfectly clear that the licence was not transferable there was nothing else that we could do the fellows couldnt preserve greyfriars hall but they are perfectly at liberty to set up a new college
2576494 for all intents and purposes the licence has been surrendered
2576495 claro que extra o el gol y primero dios tenga la oportunidad de anotar ma ana contra toluca pues uno como delantero siempre quiere anotar sin embargo estoy tranquilo porque esta situaci n la he pasado en varias ocasiones y s que lo nico que debo hacer en estos momentos es no desesperarme y si en caso de que no haya gol ayudar a mis compa eros que es tambi n mi funci n lo importante es que el equipo salga bien conectado para cumplir con el prop sito de quedarnos nuevamente con el triunfo en casa
2576496 durante este par de jornadas que se han disputado estoy en buenas condiciones y me he sentido muy bien fisicamente aunque futbol sticamente me estoy adaptando mucho m s y conforme pasen los partidos tratar de recuperar un gran nivel y de esa manera dar lo mejor de m
2576497 llegu el pasado 22 de abril he estado viendo entrenamientos viendo partidos y bueno yendo a cursos que han habido en liverpool el mes pasado fui a un curso en florencia voy a ir uno a septiembre en alemania y ahorita estoy en el curso para obtener el t tulo uefa en la fundaci n marcet en barcelona muy contento de haber tomado esta decisi n
2576498 mira en m xico ya se empezaron a cortar las edades de los jugadores y no me era complicado encontrar equipo sino ya tener una regularidad
2576499 estuve una temporada en jaguares y casi me la pas jugando en la filial de primera a entrenaba con el primer equipo aunque jugaba en jaguares de tapachula ya me cans de que luego no se me diera una oportunidad por lo que decid empezar la carrera de t cnico
2576500 s a veces igual ten a cosas buenas como por contra si tuve varias experiencias desagradables con entrenadores o gente que no me quer a o no quer a a mi pap no s de todas formas a m me gusta mucho el futbol y quiero seguir ligado a el
2576501 por mi pap que cuando tiene vacaciones o no est entrenando siempre viaja a inglaterra donde hay un gusto esquisito por el futbol adem s all tiene conocidos y me recomend ir a liverpool a ver entrenamientos a ver buen futbol
2576502 si tuve la oportunidad de viajar para escocia y vivir toda una semana de entrenamientos y de partidos del barcelona gracias eso s a rafa m rquez
2576503 estuvo muy amable conmigo el conoc a a mi pap de la selecci n nacional y se port de manera m s que excelente es un gran jugador y un ejemplo para todos los que nos dedicamos en m xico a este deporte adem s de ser nuestro capit n en la selecci n fue bonito poder estar unos d as con el
2576504 la verdad es que muy muy bien al principio del curso me cost trabajo adaptarme pues es algo diferente a lo que estoy acostumbrado es decir prepararme a dar indicaciones y no a recibirlas me est gustando bastante y creo que voy a sacar mucho provecho de este curso son 10 d as en lo que se ven tanto aspectos de t ctica como pr ctica en cancha as el martes pasado fu mos al entrenamiento del espanyol y fue muy interesante pues pude platicar mucho con un porterazo como fue tommy nkono
2576505 el curso lo est n dando en ingl s unos profesores de irlanda me parece bien ya que esa forma aprendes mejor el idioma y te sirve much simo hay una bonita convivencia e intercambio de ideas con gente de todo el mundo pues est n sac ndose el curso africanos espa oles portugueses coreanos brasile os e incluso est una chica de costa rica y esa siempre es una experiencia muy enriquecedora
2576506 ahorita de lo que se trata es aprender lo m s que pueda y bueno a esperar que llegue el momento de que algui n me d una oportunidad
2576507 claro para m quiz s m s que a nadie podr a aprenderle mucho a l me agradar a empezar trabajando a su lado es algo que me encantar a y cuando llegu el momento ya apartarme para hacer carrera propia
2576508 el ambiente que se respira es muy diferente al ambiente futbolero de m xico lo que me gusta es que la gente es muy apasionada al futbol todos quieren y aman al futbol en inglaterra est s rodeado de futbol todo el d a y es lo que yo buscaba en mi pa s no a toda la gente es tan apasionada en la cancha como son los ingleses
2576509 seguramente sea muy prematuro hablar que van a andar mal pues apenas van dos jornadas y aparte estuvieron jugando hace poco la superliga que se jugaba a mitad de semana entonces conf o que van a levantar en los pr ximos partidos conf o adem s que se va hacer esta vez un buen mundial de clubs
2576510 el quisiera tener una oportunidad en europa o quiz s dirigir a alguna selecci n dirigi la selecci n de m xico pero desafortunadamente no le fue bien y siempre se qued con esa espina de ir a una copa del mundo
2576511 se otorga a televisa los derechos de transmitir por televisi n gratuita o de paga televisi n v a sat lite televisi n de cable tambi n la distribuci n inal mbrica y televisi n por internet
2576512 la cantidad no la vamos a manejar porque tiene una cl usula dentro del contrato de confidencialidad en donde no estamos manejando ni el monto del contrato ni la duraci n del mismo nosotros no vamos a divulgar la cifra con la cual negociamos con televisa como les comento hay una cl usula donde estos temas no los vamos a tratar en la uni n p blica
2576513 guadalajara estar como en el contrato anterior donde no pasaba por la televisi n abierta es por ppv y televisa tiene un plazo de 24 horas para transmitirlo en televisi n abierta una vez que se termine el partido pero es importante mencionar que el 70 por ciento se transmitir n por televisi n abierta y el otro 30 por ciento televisa definir si va abierto o por paga lo que es un hecho es que en todos los partidos de repechaje si fuera el caso o si fueran cuartos de final semifinal y la final as como los partidos en contra del am rica todos esos partidos ser n transmitidos por la televisi n abierta a nivel nacional
2576514 estamos muy contentos por la negociaci n que se lleg a cabo para chivas con televisa y definitivamente se transmitir n los partidos como se ven an haciendo es un gusto y nos da gusto tener la firma con el contrato de televisa es muy importante y los partidos ser n transmitidos a las siete de la tarde los s bados a menos que por un arreglo de ambas partes se llegue a un cambio

2576516 si se gana comenzaremos un nuevo camino sobre todo en el estadio jalisco va empezando esto fueron dos partidos desafortunados en la liga en uno nos empataron en el ltimo minuto y ante tecos perdimos por un errorcito que tuvimos por ah pero yo veo al grupo con mucha confianza se entren bien y espero lo mejor para este partido
2576517 todos sabemos lo que es chivas y tenemos que mejorar en muchos aspectos para poder sacar un triunfo no hay pretexto tenemos la responsabilidad nosotros y tenemos que salir adelante
2576518 no lo veo como presi n sino como ilusi n de poder ganar el primer partido

2576524 en todos los partidos hay que sacar los triunfos luego empieza a rodar el bal n y te tienes que ir adaptando a lo que se vaya viendo pero ese ser nuestro pensamiento inicial para el partido

2576540 what is so surprising is that rapid almost sudden changes take place in the earths magnetic field
2576541 may suggest the possibility of an upcoming reversal of the geomagnetic field
2576542 it is in this region that the shielding effect of the magnetic field is severely reduced thus allowing high energy particles of the hard radiation belt to penetrate deep into the upper atmosphere to altitudes below a hundred kilometers 62 miles
2576543 they provide a good rationale to continue this monitoring longer

2576545 georgien russland und die ganze welt sehen jetzt ganz klar ein dass sich die georgische f hrung mit ihren nato bestrebungen kaum von dem wunsch leiten l sst ein teil der globalen sicherheitssystems zu werden und zum internationalen frieden beizutragen
2576546 ihre nato bestrebungen sind auf etwas anderes zur ckzuf hren und zwar auf den versuch andere l nder und v lker in ihre blutigen unterfangen hineinzuziehen
2576547 gem den geltenden internationalen abkommen darunter aus dem jahr 1999 bernimmt russland friedensmissionen falls eine konfliktpartei gegen die vereinbarung ber den gewaltverzicht verst t ist russland verpflichtet die andere partei in schutz zu nehmen das haben wir in bezug auf s dossetien auch getan
2576548 wir fordern die georgische f hrung auf die aggression gegen s dossetien sowie verst e gegen die bisherigen friedensvereinbarungen sofort zu stoppen und legitime rechte und interessen anderer v lker zu beachten
2576549 in russland verhielt man sich immer mit gro em respekt zum georgischen volk man h lt es f r ein brudervolk so bleibt es auch k nftig trotz der verbrecherischen politik der heutigen georgischen staatsf hrung diese wird das georgische volk nach einiger zeit selbst objektiv bewerten

2576609 i get told times a great healer i wish time could rewind itself i wish this time would rewind so this person would see me graduate from university i wish time would rewind so that he could walk me down the aisle
2576610 this person was taken away from me right in front of my eyes accepting that hes not coming back is the hardest thing ever
2576611 my dad never saw my 16th birthday he never got to see me in my prom dress thats something every daughter wishes their dad to see
2576612 i cant believe he is gone he will never walk me down the aisle or see his grandchildren the night of his attack is a night i will never ever forget i will make sure that garry newlove my dad is never forgotten for the loving person he was
2576613 it hurts me to think what pain my dad went through on that night but i think he feels more pain to not be with his family right now
2576614 youre romantic in your outlook and love the simplicity of nature you can be a little nostalgic and you like landscapes that make you feel calm when it comes to art you are passionate about history and full of respect for the skills that have been around for centuries truly great art stands the test of time as for music youre a focused listener with one ear in the past you love the buzz you feel from watching a live performance its great to watch skillful musicians work their magic right up close
2576615 you love physical activity youve got serious wanderlust keeping a clear head and healthy body makes you ready for whatever life throws at you for kicks nothing beats an adrenalin rush you like to take risks and push limits youre confident and brave life is for the living when it comes to holidays youll take experience over comfort every time whether under canvas or under the stars you love the chance to be in the wilderness and relish the freedom of being in charge of where youre heading and what turns you off vanity in a world gone mad you favor a natural look fantastic not plastic
2576616 you appreciate the simplicity of nature and the beauty of the world around you its important to slow down and retreat from frenzy of life when it comes to drinking nothing beats a night out with your mates after all you work hard and deserve to unwind sometimes you just need a drink to relax at the end of the day as for the home you have very cool and contemporary taste you like your surroundings to be simple and functional cozy and approachable

2576629 legislate failure in iraq suggested today that there is little difference between the two on one question they both want to bring american troops home
2576630 the great difference is i intend to win the war first mccain told an assembly of veterans today
2576631 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure mccain said at a meeting of the disabled american veterans in las vegas
2576632 this was back when supporting americas efforts in iraq entailed serious political risk
2576633 better than most the men and women in this room know the hardships and costs of war you were there when your country needed you you shouldered heavy burdens and accepted great risks
2576634 im sure many of you will also recall from your experiences in war as i do from mine that when youre somewhere on the other side of the world in the service of america you pay attention to the news from back home
2576635 the good judment of the next president mccain told the veterans see his speech here
2576636 though victory in iraq is finally in sight a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president mccain said
2576637 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
2576638 with just three months to go before the election a lot of folks are still trying to square senator obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq
2576639 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure mccain said
2576640 this was back when supporting americas efforts in iraq entailed serious political risk
2576641 thanks to the courage and sacrifice of our soldiers sailors airmen and marines and to brave iraqi fighters the surge has succeeded
2576642 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2576643 it will also fall to the next commander in chief to make good on the obligation our government accepts every time any man or woman enters the proud ranks of the united states military and again when they receive their dd 214
2576644 the dav has defined some of these obligations in your stand up for veterans pledge
2576645 in practice veterans must be treated fairly and expeditiously as they seek compensation for disability or illness
2576646 as president i will do all that is in my power to ensure that those who serve today and those who have served in the past have access to the highest quality health mental health and rehabilitative care in the world
2576647 im not here to tell you that there is a cost that is too high to be paid in the care of our nations veterans
2576648 exactly because funding va programs command bipartisan support some in the congress like to attach unrelated appropriations and earmarks to va bills
2576649 when we make it clear to congress that no earmark bill will be signed into law that will save many billions of dollars that can be applied to essential priorities and above all the care of our veterans
2576650 my administration will create a veterans care access card to be used by veterans with illness or injury incurred during their military service and by those with lower incomes
2576651 this card is not intended to either replace the va or privatize veterans health care as some have wrongly charged
2576652 even so there are veterans eligible for care who are not currently able to receive it on account of distance wait times or the absence of certain specialties and for this group the new card i propose will offer better alternatives to provide the benefits they have earned
2576653 reform must also recognize that greater care is needed for certain types of injuries
2576654 the va must also broaden its care for the women who are entering the armed forces in greater numbers than ever
2576655 all reforms bring change and even the best changes can be a little unsettling what you should know about this reform is that it is an extension of the current system not a replacement as a matter of duty and of honor whatever our commitments to veterans cost those commitments will be kept
2576656 the next president will have many responsibilities to the american people and i take them all seriously
2576657 it is every veterans hope that should their children be called upon to answer a call to arms the battle will be necessary and the field well chosen
2576658 many of them have served multiple tours in iraq and afghanistan

2576764 sudah menjadi pengetahuan umum semejak menjadi penasihat de facto pkr anwar menolak ketuanan melayu dan dasar ekonomi baru deb dasar menolak ketuanan bangsa dan menjaga hak keistimewaan kaum ini selaras dengan salah satu rukun neocon yang menolak dasar affirmative action hak keistimewaan bagi yahudi neocon yang berideologi zionis tidak dibenarkan wujud bangsa bangsa lain di dunia ini yang lebih mulia daripada yahudi hanya yahudi sahaja bangsa paling mulia dan bangsa pilihan tuhan hanya bangsa yahudi sahaja boleh mengamalkan affirmative action bangsa bangsa lain tidak dibenarkan kerana mereka yang bukan yahudi itu bangsa kelas kedua jadi sekiranya bangsa bangsa lain cuba mengamalkan dasar affirmative action maka usaha perlu dilakukan untuk menghapuskan dasar itu sikap anwar mengikut telunjuk yahudi terbukti apabila mengatasi keadaan gawat ekonomi malaysia 1997 pada anwar yang ketika itu menteri kewangan hanya meminjam dana imf sahaja boleh membantu memulihkan ekonomi betapa akrabnya anwar dengan pengerusi imf michael camdessus hingga berpeluk peluk maksudnya sekiranya malaysia pinjam dana imf semua dasar dasar affirmative action yang diamalkan oleh kerajaan akan dihapuskan kerana imf mewujudkan persaingan global tidak ada subsidi diberikan kerajaan kepada rakyat kerana imf menuntut pulangan modal yang lebih lumayan ketika itu ekonomi malaysia dikawal seluruhnya oleh amerika kalau amerika bersungguh sungguh serang iraq kerana telaga minyak malaysia pun ada telaga minyak dan petronas
2576765 yang penting ketiga tiga alasan ini ada kaitan dengan yahudi dan amerika kalau anwar bagaikan bulan purnama maka isu isu ini adalah awan hitam yang boleh menggerhanakan beliau sebagai pemenang bintang perdana menteri pm ada lagi isu isu lain seperti perbedaan dari segi gerak kerja dan kekuatan antara pas pkr amp dap peribadi anwar berbanding ustaz hadi dikatakan juga tindak tanduk anwar membelakangkan pakatan rakyat gendang kosong contohnya nak dapatkan pelabur di selangor atau 30 kerusi parlimen masih belum menampakkan bunga bunga kenyataan tuduhan tuduhan skandal dan lain lain pada saya pas kena dapatkan jalan pintas untuk realisasikan dasar perjuangannya termasuk turunkan harga minyak pas cuma menunggu dan memilih kumpulan mana yang dapat membantu cita cita perjuangannya kunci pembukanya adalah muzakarah

2576772 im training with jamie fletcher and for the last month or so ive been working with josh barnett as well i think this extra mma training has been good for my conditioning and stamina and it will help in k 1 i only know my opponent justice a little i wont say its going to be an easy fight but maybe after its done if i knock him out in the first round then ill say it was an easy fight i didnt specifically train for him just the regular two sessions a day cardio and hard sparring in the gym there aint too many people who can take my power so im hoping for a knockout replied the 206cm 69
2576773 ive been trying for five years to get into k 1 and now i want to show everyone that i belong here i dont want to brag but ive trained religiously and my shins are like steel i know mo is powerful but im powerful as well im going to work my hard jab for a while and pick my strikes with precision i know if i catch him he will go down
2576774 well aerts is well rounded in a different way than i am ive been working on my technique and i have some surprises ready
2576775 take the double low kick for example a lot of people throw the low kick but they dont double it up that gets peoples attention i want to win the tournament on saturday its nice to win a superfight but when you win a tournament thats what people remember you for
2576776 but ive worked on my technique as well so there will be more than just taking blows i like k 1 and i feel comfortable with all styles of fighting i just spent four months of hard training in bangkok to sharpen up my muay thai to work on different angles my style is like a big pot of hobo stew where you throw in a bunch of stuff and mix it up
2576777 i know butterbean really well and he knows me really well from the sound of the bell im just going to go after him and it will be a slugfest both of us throwing blows until someone gets knocked out
2576778 i know when i am in the reserve that someone may go out because two years ago that happened to me in amsterdam and i fought in the final losing to bjorn bregy i always train for the entire tournament and im a well balanced fighter so ill be ready
2576779 i had a game plan for chalid because i knew he likes to step forward which i like but im hoping saki will also want to step in and fight
2576780 i started as a boxer most of what we did was tournament style with several fights in the day so i dont have to worry about fighting three times ive been doing muay thai as well so k 1 fits my style also k 1 is the biggest in the world so i want to show the world that samoans are not only strong with the punches but can kick as well i will be smart and fight for the points but if a knockout comes it comes my goal is to win the world gp championship in japan
2576781 ive been training hard here where there are fewer distractions and i can concentrate on preparing for the tournament which i can see myself winning of course everyone faces the same challenges to keep moving forward while avoiding damage in full contact karate we fight in many fights in a day that spirit has made me what i am today i have the calm that allows me to focus on finding the solution when the storm is raging i stopped karate for three years to work on kickboxing training using my hands to create opportunities for other things and i think thats made me a better fighter with intensity and a varied arsenal i will do whatever is right depending on the situation
2576782 the blue eyed samurai thats a real pretty name for him
2576783 i dont really come up with cute names im the savage and i come in to be the most aggressive i can be win the fight and get out as fast as i can i dont know if nick should be going around calling himself a samurai but if he is then more power to him ill be the samurai with brown eyes if you like
2576784 ive been preparing using multiple sparring partners with a new partner every round so they are always fresh also i have a new trainer just for conditioning stamina and core strength and balance and so on i dont think nick is going to try to box me i think hes going to come out looking to chop my legs out so ill be ready for that and counter him with my strongest weapon punches
2576785 i feel very good i trained very hard and im ready as always you must not forget im 23 years old im just a kid with a dream i want three belts the world gp heavyweight and super heavyweight im 100 confident i can do that if i werent i would just stay at home as for saturday i dont know much about domagoj except that i fought him a couple of years ago and knocked him out i advise him to keep his hands high because thats what i want to do tomorrow just knock him out to finish the fight
2576786 that was three years ago and i underestimated him he was 10kg lighter then and i thought what a skinny kid this time ill try to keep to the middle of the ring and answer his punches i think mine are stronger i learned a lesson when i underestimated hari maybe hell learn the same lesson tomorrow
2576787 ive been working with ernesto on getting the distance right getting in and out and boxing and topping it off with kicks i want to put aside the muay thai style and fight more in the explosive k 1 style im ready to fight i know azizs strong points his right hand ive seen his fights and hes technical and good but i dont think hes fought many heavyweights or taken kicks from heavyweights so well see
2576788 all i know about slowinski is he is a k 1 fighter and this is just a routine fight for me yes ive watched some videos of slowinski but tomorrow when i see him in the ring i think i can win easily

2576801 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2576802 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2576803 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2576804 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2576805 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2576806 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2576807 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2576808 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2576817 the early signs are very encouraging but i would expect a lot more two way trade and investment over the coming years as the private sector impetus grows on the back of increased understanding of the opportunities on offer

2576970 the governors who are recalled with less than 50 percent of the vote will make it known theyre not happy very very quickly and i think if morales is not ratified by a big margin we could see a deepening of the political crisis

2576999 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2577000 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2577001 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2577002 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2577003 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2577004 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2577005 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2577006 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2577007 i kept him at arms length as best i could

2577013 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2577014 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2577015 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2577016 war is never a good thing no one wants it

2577020 we noticed how to add more and more music and still keep the story moving forward it felt like you got to a certain part of the script and you just went music when i started watching every musical i could trying to understand why i liked them so much i realized music didnt stop the story and added depth to the characters

2577024 theres been a lot more of it over the past few years which is really fabulous
2577025 when i was in college moulin rouge came out and my friends and i obsessed over it it was the first musical that had come out in a long long time
2577026 i love playing villains theyre just delicious i try to make every person i play her own character as opposed to oh its just the ingenue i think maggie gyllenhaal does that she makes every part special and not just the girlfriend i admire that
2577027 never offend people with style when you can offend them with substance
2577028 como nos afectaron como nos agredieron y para tratar de cubrir esa culpa para tratar de justificar lo injustificable dijeron que los ecuatorianos eran amigos de los guerrilleros y por qu no dijeron en ese momento tambi n las otras relaciones que tuvieron si ten an toda la informaci n a la mano
2577029 lo que quer an las autoridades colombianas era tratar de tapar esta agresi n injustificada
2577030 ser vecinos de un pa s que vive un conflicto armado interno y que es uno de los principales productores de coca na es un problema de seguridad para nuestro pa s
2577031 ha bajado los ataques a ecuador y eso me parece positivo que esa conducta se mantenga que las medidas de confianza se fortalezcan esas medidas ser n pasos importantes para restablecer primero la confianza mutua y despu s las relaciones

2577045 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2577046 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2577047 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2577048 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2577049 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2577050 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2577051 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2577052 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this

2577056 gentlemans agreement that none of the parties in the case would talk about it
2577057 i am somewhat surprised that this level of candor has been expressed by a judge involved in the case
2577058 however i find myself in full agreement with judge fuller this is something ive said in the past
2577059 it was good there were some good things and some bad things like you always see in a scrimmage situation
2577060 well watch the film and watch the individual efforts and those kinds of things but for the most part i think it went very very well
2577061 im more of a running back so i have to get in the mindset of running the ball more instead of just pounding it in there and blocking linebackers i think ive made the transition well it started last spring thats when i knew i had to change my style
2577062 thats whats nice about having four options thats something weve worked hard on and will continue to work hard on if the defense doesnt make all their reads then you can get somebody alone and pop for a long run or get a receiver behind the defense it makes the defense play very disciplined
2577063 they understand what were trying to do from an offensive standpoint we work at it every day during practice its going well
2577064 but just the electronic version are hign to rmb 7600 i never considering the intellectual artical are so valuable
2577065 i got 4 1 for my horse when most of the bookies were offering 9 2 get in
2577066 was there anyone who hated your husband mrs williams was there anyone who wanted to see him dead
2577067 oh no everyone loved him we even had richard dawkins singing at sunday lunch one week well actually we did get some trouble from a local nutrition therapist
2577068 well one sunday roger preached a sermon on splendor of creation and the creator having provided us with more than we could ever hope or desire
2577069 well the dean of woking coveted his job horrible man
2577070 thank you for joing us mr whole food you have certainly been the subject of a lot of controversy recently can you comment on the allegations that basingstoke fe college appointed you as its acting honorary deputy lecturer in nutrition in exchange for cash
2577071 well not exactly the school of social sciences is doing some trials with fish oil supplements in local basingstoke primary schools the nettlay corporation are kindly funding the venture
2577072 dont they produce fish oil supplements is there any control group arent you the head of research of nettlay neutraceutical
2577073 well we dont really need a control group as we already know fish oil supplementation works beside it would be too expensive
2577074 hmmm the nettlay corporation did have pre tax profits of 200million last year so you would have thought they could have found a small amount of cash to do a proper controlled experiement there have been some strange goings on in basingsoke recently what was your reaction to the death of the rt rev roger williams
2577075 well of course it was a tragedy although supporters of orthomolecular medicine had their differences with the bishop we recognise that all those in favour of optimum nutrition have to work together thats why myself and anne nick dote are working with the dean of woking to help out with his memorial service which takes place on friday
2577076 what are your plans for the next few months mr whole food
2577077 i beg your pardon mr whole food this the bbc you know swearing before the watershed is one thing but you are also guilty of product placement
2577078 get out of my studio at least radovan never swore when i met him
2577079 now my friends is the hour of decision are you for or against optimum nutrition the choice is yours
2577080 part of the reason i want to move is because my ex wife will continue to deny me acess to my kids
2577081 like dude that is not mine i totally didnt do that
2577082 en la vida hay dos caminos uno el que buscas y otro el que te encuentras
2577083 hay dos formas de ver la vida una es creer que no existen milagros la otra es creer que todo es un milagro
2577084 ascoltami decidi puoi scegliere di vivere una vita sapendo quello che avresti potuto provare per lei senza che lei lo sappia oppure scegliere la via pi dura quella che ti fa arrivare in alto alla cima dalla quale potresti anche cadere facendoti molto male con questa via che la tua persona amata sapr che quello che fai che tutti i respiri tutti i pensieri tutto dedicato a lei se la ami a questora nn saresti a parlarne con me
2577085 quel che pi riconosco com ora pi che mai quello che ho nascosto
2577086 illustrate that our universe is not only deeply strange but also almost impossibly beautiful
2577087 tu puoi stare solo cn la principessine quelle cm me non sono fatte per te
2577088 che me ne faccio io del principessine s gi visto cm andata a finire che ci faccio le tengo in perizoma sul letto per svuotarmi le palle
2577089 tanto quello di cui hai bisogno tu noo lhai fatto finora
2577090 the kids that come and get to shop there their eyes are all big and they love it
2577091 they get to pick the things that they want and thats pretty cool
2577092 back to school is always a hard time it costs a couple hundred dollars to get your kid kitted out for back to school
2577093 but being 99 percent honest is no longer enough you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2577094 and yes by these people i mean the blacks hiyooooooooooooooooooo

2577098 unanimously recommended that the plinth should continue to be used for an ongoing series of temporary works of art commissioned from leading national and international artists
2577099 there will be something extraordinarily sensual about the play of light through the coloured glass its going to feel like a sculpture of brilliance and light
2577100 there are many worthy suggestions for statues on the fourth plinth and some people feel passionately about each of them all proposals will be judged on their merits including its current use as one of the most high profile sites for contemporary public art in london the cost of erecting the current work on the plinth is 270 000 the cost of a permanent monument is likely to be considerably more

2577104 as president alan evans must accept responsibility for the groups failure to publicly disclose on time how much money the organisation donated to the labor and coalition parties mr evans should explain if the group made a mistake or if there was an attempt to cover up the 225 000 in donations either way the law has been broken and alan evans needs to accept responsibility
2577105 we have an obligation to be involved in the political process in order to advance the interests of our members
2577106 it is important to note that we do not donate money to political parties instead we purchase tables at political functions and events that are attended by members of parliament at both a state and federal level
2577107 internally we have a set of rules that govern this process namely that what we give to one side of politics we give to another in order to ensure fairness and that we only attend those events at which there are representatives from the areas of relevance to our members
2577108 unfortunately this is a reality of being involved in the political process today
2577109 money given at fundraisers flows into the coffers of the major parties and buys influence just like direct donations what mr evans is admitting to is the potential money brings to bend the ears of mps at swanky fund raising events who knows whether nrma members are happy with their money being handed over by alan evans to political parties
2577110 the nrma has no reason to not disclose its political contributions and took steps to ensure its obligation was met

2577120 in recent decades governments were advised to stabilize privatize and liberalize there is merit in what lies behind this injunction governments should not try to do too much replacing markets or closing the economy off from the rest of the world but we believe this prescription defines ther role of government too narrowly

2577130 now there are those who believe that the purpose of business rules is replacing developers with business people development without developers i am not one of these people as i believe the value in business rules is in allowing collaboration between two groups with different but valid perspectives yet this difference of perspective often results in serious problems when developing complex systems business users are at the mercy of regulations court rulings and business policies that must be enforced they must also respond to an ever changing business and competitive environment this often means they cant stabilize their requirements or explain them easily to developers legal or business jargon does not always map well to java code
2577131 many organizations have a similar problem with their data as they accumulate more of it at a compound annual growth rate of about 60 percent reckons idc it gets harder and harder to find the information they need the problem is compounded when bad data isnt purged from systems

2577142 tony is over in spain speaking to the player at the moment but that doesnt mean he will be signing for us
2577143 he is a player with great pedigree and has an outstanding goalscoring record but he isnt the only player we are looking at
2577144 there is a lot going on behind the scenes and i am desperately hoping we can get at least a couple in before the bolton game next week
2577145 we are working tirelessly trying to get players in and there are quite a few irons in the fire at the moment but we will not sign someone for the sake of it
2577146 we have to make sure we get the right players in who have the right quality and the right attitude
2577147 amdy is with us because he is a player who has plenty of top flight experience after playing for portsmouth and newcastle
2577148 we knew alonso was a very good player and as a result he had a good price on his head we had offers but they were not enough so we decided he needed to stay with us
2577149 for me it is not a problem if he stays or not he can stay we always have felt he is a good player
2577150 we are only talking about a very very good price he is a good player if he is not going to bring a good price then it is very simple easy to understand
2577151 i heard the crowd obviously we know now as we knew before that he could stay with us
2577152 it is not positive that we may not have the players we want here before the champions league game
2577153 but the transfer window closes at the end of august we will try to do our best to bring in the players to improve us by then
2577154 i try to do the best for my club with the possibilities that you have i have done this every year since i have been here

2577158 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
2577159 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
2577160 its not my job i didnt say it in an ugly tone of voice
2577161 i was already freaked out because she was accusing me of stuff i didnt do
2577162 you dont go to jail because you like different restaurants do you
2577163 we cannot think of a better day to celebrate the beginning of a happy new family and the happiest moment for our country these two things should go hand in hand
2577164 it is cold calculation a normal episode in which i was insulted a little i did write a book about him everybody knew that we were friends so it would be unnatural for us to stop talking so if he wanted to cut communication he would have to do something cruel
2577165 you must analyse and weigh up how great a contribution academician sakharov made to the cause of peace and how great to kindling the flames of war
2577166 i was in a difficult situation i said he is a good candidate but i am not in a position to judge the others
2577167 i knew sooner or later it would happen i was cut from his circle like others before it is sad he died unfortunately without a single friend he was absolutely isolated he didnt have anyone who came to discuss politics with him
2577168 the mystery is why we thought it would be otherwise
2577169 while the chinese government still hears the same 1990s language coursing around western politicians speeches it knows that human rights at home or abroad dont make the a list of the agenda any more in its dealings with the major powers

2577171 abyei is a very important town because of where is sits
2577172 now there is a great deal of conflict in the region we are warning of the possibility of more
2577173 after the peace we saw schools built and changes happening it transformed south sudan
2577174 now always on the horizon there could be a war again and our progress could all be taken away
2577175 it is a sign of the level of tensions when what should have been a minor incident turned into a full scale battle that is displacing citizens
2577176 what we need now is coordinated international action especially from the members of the security council
2577177 if we dont stay on it no one will be talking about the crisis in darfur

2577185 i recorded the stories because we feared that my grandmother would die soon but she didnt she even saw the play when it opened in los angeles
2577186 its really thrilling for me to be here with the golden child because i do have roots here in the philippines my mothers family is based here my mother grew up here and this play has filipino roots
2577187 ive been really looking forward to this trip and feeling at various times during the last 40 years that its ridiculous that i havent been back here since i was 10
2577188 this is a wonderful opportunity to dovetail my personal desire to have a homecoming with this show which is based on stories that my grandmother told me when i was a kid in the philippines
2577189 i discovered a whole side of my family history and culture that was so different from what i knew as a chinese american kid born and raised in la it helped me have a larger vision of myself and what i could be to meet all these relatives and understand the history of our family in this country
2577190 i didnt think of myself as a writer i didnt know anything about the theater and i didnt write again in any major sense until after i got to college when i decided to try my hand at being a playwright
2577191 skip forward another 20 years in the 1990s when i was in my 40s
2577192 my mother really wants me to tell everybody that a lot of things in the play are fictional
2577193 thats true but at the same time its based on the stories of my family and the stories my grandmother told me which are very much the seed of the work thats presented here
2577194 im thrilled that hes the person at the helm of this production
2577195 i couldnt be happier that my homecoming coincides with the presentation of a play that began here in the philippines 40 years ago

2577208 we wanted to share our academic work with the security community and had planned to withhold a key detail of our results so that a malicious attacker could not use our research for fraudulent purposes
2577209 were disappointed that the court is preventing us from presenting our findings even with this safeguard
2577210 the courts order is an illegal prior restraint on legitimate academic research in violation of the first amendment
2577211 the court has adopted an interpretation of the statute that is blatantly unconstitutional equating discussion in a public forum with computer intrusion security and the public interest benefit immensely from the free flow of ideas and information on vulnerabilities more importantly squelching research and scientific discussion wont stop the attackers it will just stop the public from knowing that these systems are vulnerable and from pressuring the companies that develop and implement them to fix security holes

2577239 wives submit to your husbands as to the lord for the husband is the head of the wife as christ is the head of the church his body of which he is the savior
2577240 25husbands love your wives just as christ loved the church and gave himself up for her 26to make her holy cleansing a her by the washing with water through the word 27and to present her to himself as a radiant church without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish but holy and blameless
2577241 without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish but holy and blameless
2577242 in this same way husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies he who loves his wife loves himself after all no one ever hated his own body but he feeds and cares for it just as christ does the church for we are members of his body
2577243 for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh this is a profound mystery but i am talking about christ and the church however each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself and the wife must respect her husband
2577244 do you not know that your bodies are members of christ himself shall i then take the members of christ and unite them with a prostitute never
2577245 this is a profound mystery but i am talking about christ and the church

2577252 mrs toguchi prayers are nice and its probably very helpful but you still need chemotherapy
2577253 dear lord youre the one who created my body so i know you can fix it
2577254 i put my whole faith in you father damien please pray for me too because i need your help
2577255 it may have delayed her eventual demise probably slow the cancer down but eventually she would have succumbed to this vicious cancer
2577256 the point here is that the primary tumor was treated
2577257 the bottom line is it probably does happen obviously it happens very rarely because it is the nature of cancer to grow not to regress
2577258 for the true believer or faithful this is a miracle for the true skeptic this is a random or very unusual coincidence for the doctor and scientist we call it complete spontaneous regression of cancer
2577259 im not the praying type but i just wanted to say thank you
2577260 1 5 cest beaucoup trop pour celui l de plus il nest pas tr s frais

2577263 they have to concentrate on competition but its very tough
2577264 we know it is the olympic games and all of us sportsmen want everything to be normal
2577265 when the war is in your country at such a time it is very difficult for them for all of us
2577266 we are tying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the olympic games so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing
2577267 i see all the nations get together i am very upset about it i wish everybody would be at peace especially during the olympics
2577268 focus sigue sorprendiendo y encantando a los clientes en todo el pa s pero la bomba es en texas donde las ventas de focus casi se han duplicado

2577270 if he is out of the picture weapons of mass destruction capability has been set back which would make this one of the more effective strikes in recent years
2577271 i believe that al qaida has no shortage of people adept with explosives and i know that al masri promulgated training manuals for poisons
2577272 but im not sure how skilled any of proteges may be at synthesizing chemical weapons or toxins
2577273 you need both education and hands on experience to produce decent quality chemical weapons or toxins
2577274 from the u s government perspective he was seen as a major threat his potential to develop primitive weapons of mass destruction was not taken lightly by u s law enforcement and intelligence agencies
2577275 the death of abu khabab al masri has a short term impact on operations by eliminating a competent senior leader
2577276 over the long run however al qaida has demonstrated an ability to replace most of its leaders that have been captured or killed
2577277 the 12 000 plus that are slated to attend the fight in lesnars present hometown will definitely be pro brock which cant hurt a thing as it relates to lesnars chances of not going 0 2 in the ufc lesnar can easily morph into a beast and a rah rah college like atmosphere may facilitate that transformation which some might consider to be costly for brock if he takes any unnecessary chances or tries to accomplish too much too fast being a lesnar fan i have plenty of concerns regarding this fight but i do think he will win and demonstrate how much his technique has improved since his debut its really hard to see this fight going to the judges
2577278 friday might not have been the best day for some wrestlers to answer their cell phones or home phones or blackberrys or emails or even answer their front doors
2577279 great to hear that jonathan coachman has started his new gig for espn with his first assignment being on espn news i expect to see coachs career advance nicely on espn after he gets his feet wet reading the sports on espn news coachman can do play by play and has done college football along with mens and womens hoops which will help him move up specifically having experience broadcasting womens basketball is a nice caveat for the coach to have in his pocket
2577280 they want a place where we can eat somali food and just to be
2577281 after a couple of weeks we get together to eat and talk
2577282 they are nice and they teach me how to do my work
2577283 theres nothing specific or different about the somali workers that i note
2577284 this is a town thats home to 26 nationalities we never bothered to do the statistics or research ourselves but generally speaking weve always had many different people from many different backgrounds
2577285 the right people who could appreciate and enjoy this type of work
2577286 they kind of mingle among themselves and they dont bother anybody
2577287 some of them have left because they dont like slaughterhouses but a lot of them have decided to stay for now
2577288 its a moment of truth for this city people are participating new yorkers are united with their city
2577289 will become as much a part of the new york experience as strolling the coney island boardwalk participating in the five borough bike tour or listening to the philharmonic in the park
2577290 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
2577291 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2577292 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2577293 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2577294 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2577295 they talk of democracy but they just want their hands on the power
2577296 but we couldnt let dictatorship return under the guise of democracy
2577297 we didnt really like abdallahi but he was democratically elected
2577298 whats the point of having a constitution if he can be forced out like that
2577299 my experience of him during that time is that he was a very loving giving man and this doesnt make sense at all
2577300 theres just no way he could do it they just grabbed a convenient person
2577301 the first time he kissed her he should have been thinking goodbye to my political career
2577302 feel invulnerable that they feel it has gone on all of the time that im not going to be scrutinized at this level and it will stay private
2577303 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2577304 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2577305 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2577306 i dont know what causes one to cross a bright line like this one but its probably going to haunt him for the rest of his life its colossal
2577307 fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make
2577308 i liked him before but i dont see any integrity
2577309 the image of him and his wife was very important the image of that union
2577310 apparently barack obama is also taking a vacation from the facts ignoring his own votes in support of the yucca mountain project either barack obama is too inexperienced to understand that his votes on the floor of the united states senate are recorded for americans to review or hes simply showing incredible hypocrisy
2577311 because of these safety issues and the unwavering opposition from the people of nevada and their elected officials there is strong reason to believe that many more billions of dollars could be expended on yucca mountain without any significant progress in moving towards a permanent solution to the problem of where to store spent nuclear fuel
2577312 a child has to know where he comes from he needs to know what this country is about
2577313 theyre angry theyre wondering why they have gotten into their teen years without learning about it
2577314 theyre shocked at what humans beings do to each other
2577315 white americans in the north pretty much thought violence against blacks was a southern thing the springfield riot really came as a bolt of lightning to northern newspaper readers
2577316 the question was if it can happen in springfield maybe it can happen anywhere
2577317 this was the right thing to do theres no question in my mind
2577318 they turned it into tourism dollars this horror that occurred in their hometown
2577319 this would be like seeing a shirt that had the towers falling on 9 11 people making money off the tragedy that everyone had to endure
2577320 the negroes would come to the window and rush back they didnt dare come out for fear theyd get shot they went back in and anybody that i knew or talked to said there were negroes in there that were burned up
2577321 im filing a 10 million libel action and i dont think you want ap to be part of that
2577322 its a story of courage of a very brave service dog taking care of me he passed away i was so depressed i had him cloned
2577323 that i would ski naked down mount everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2577324 i have been played up as a very wicked and perverted woman
2577325 she is a person of note in our little community
2577326 his feet dangling and within reach the men and boys played with the corpse by swinging it back and forth against the building to hear the dull thud
2577327 it wasnt in mississippi it was in illinois that jarred people
2577328 add the fact that its where lincoln is buried you have a lot of symbolism lincoln was a live memory to a lot of people
2577329 i found it hypocritical that in this town its all about lincoln we want to embrace him then you find out whoah this is who we are this is springfield
2577330 all day and all night long he had a gun on each shoulder and he marched from where our store was to our home and that was back and forth all evening
2577331 its a history that has to be brought out into the open it really has to be
2577332 it is extremely important that we take time to recognize the significance of the race riots that we teach our children all about them
2577333 and that we rededicate ourselves to the notion that we must all work together to ensure that something like that never happens again
2577334 to rapidly and responsibly meet the needs of the iraqi people
2577335 sustain to plan to budget execute and provide those services for the people
2577336 the challenge has been to come up with a distribution plan
2577337 there is an agreement to use five trucks that will work for eight hours to deliver water to the residents
2577338 every day she gets up and sweeps the gutter from her house which is on the corner down to the ditch
2577339 it depends on where you want to draw the line in the sand
2577340 can you say we want green lawns but only if youre in your 20s and 30s and 40s and after that we dont want green lawns
2577341 nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution
2577342 its difficult to quantify but my strong sense is that creationism is spreading across europe
2577343 ten years ago the movement was negligible today it is clearly more substantial
2577344 intelligent design covers a wide spectrum of beliefs just as creationists include anything from believers in a god that did no more than light the blue touch paper of life the universe and everything through to a strongly interventionist deity who counts dead sparrows answers prayers and directs the occasional thunderbolt
2577345 w e cannot say creation or evolution inasmuch as these two things respond to two different realities the story of the dust of the earth and the breath of god which we just heard does not in fact explain how human persons come to be but rather what they are it explains their inmost origin and casts light on the project that they are and vice versa the theory of evolution seeks to understand and describe biological developments but in so doing it cannot explain where the project of human persons comes from nor their inner origin nor their particular nature to that extent we are faced here with two complementary rather than mutually exclusive realities
2577346 many creationists are genuinely astonished by the diversity of living organisms
2577347 a s biologists we tend to use mechanistic metaphors which implicitly encourage the idea of a maker so one can see why the idea of an intelligent designer appeals to someone not versed in evolutionary theory intelligent design is not science and i think its bad theology but i can see why people hold the view
2577348 intelligent design is attracting some serious attention its not just a few quacks who think that the earth is flat
2577349 we should worry when the fundamentalists start to run public budgets and gain or attempt to gain political influence
2577350 the nations leading think tank challenging various aspects of evolutionary theory
2577351 we think the materialistic world view that has dominated western intellectual life since the late 19th century is false and we want to refute it materialism is a dehumanising philosophy
2577352 c reationism is an attack on the materialistic basis of science this carries forward into the creationist view of other evidence many creationists believe that global warming is a hoax for example they simply dont accept scientific evidence
2577353 the whole history of the debate shows us that such debates of rhetorical fencing are futile
2577354 some of the more extreme secularists who effectively say that anyone who believes in intelligent design is stupid dont help to move the debate forward
2577355 its insulting and its not surprising that the debates become acrimonious
2577356 its hard for anyone to claim that evolution hasnt taken place when theyre presented with the evidence
2577357 and its worth pointing out that many people who believe in god also regard evolution as fact the two arent incompatible
2577358 life often seems as if it walks on a knife edge
2577359 but in cases such as this there wont be an intermediate in the fossil record
2577360 y ou can track the evolution of the eye on several different occasions despite very different origins the pathways converge
2577361 they both produced the ideal parabola as described by physicists
2577362 but then again both had to adapt to overcome the same limitation so is it that surprising that they solved it in the same way
2577363 through examples such as this we can see the footprints of history even without the fossil record
2577364 theres almost a sense that these examples have to work in this way because of the environmental circumstance rather than being random common phenotypes developed to adapt to common pressures
2577365 in instances of convergence evolutionary evidence is found in the detail
2577366 molluscan and vertebrate lens composition might be remarkably similar but vertebrate retinal structure remains back to front a designer would orient the tips of photoreceptors so that they point scientists face a dilemma a failure to engage in debate could allow creationists to argue that biologists cannot rather than will not counter their arguments during a debate held in may three out of the ten republican candidates for the us presidency said that they did not believe in evolution towards the light source and the parts of the retina that carry signal towards the brain should be farther removed this seems fair enough and this is how the squid retina is built but vertebrate examples are assembled the other way around perversely light has to plunge the full depth of the retina to reach the point of reception
2577367 the evolution of paired fins into limbs with digits is a classic example of morphological transformation
2577368 evidence for homology between paired fins and limbs is compelling from an evolutionary perspective vertebrate limbs are best viewed as a specialized subset or kind of paired fins
2577369 this sets an agenda for developmental biology concerning questions about differences between fin buds and limb buds cell populations tissues signals and patterns
2577370 as these questions are answered the evolutionary transition from fins to limbs is likely to become an exemplar of changing pattern and process underpinning large scale morphological change
2577371 part of the answer is to introduce more evolutionary biology into early school curricula
2577372 children need to grow up with the fact of evolution and the awareness that it underpins biology teachers should be encouraged to be bold enough to talk about this early and often from infants onwards whatever the parents faiths or the school governors and or trustees faiths there seems to be a widespread fear of treading on toes
2577373 t oo often school science regards evolution as a given and focuses on the mechanisms mimicry and so on it rarely presents the evidence from for example the fossil record
2577374 before the cambrian life evolved fantastically slowly then there was this sudden seachange
2577375 an increase in oxygen levels is one possibility but we dont really know

2577380 diez razones para que investigadores espa oles en el extranjero no vuelvan
2577381 en uno de los trabajos se ped a a voluntarios un grupo de creyentes y otro de no creyentes que recitaran textos mientras se les somet a a un esc ner cerebral
2577382 predictibidad el batir de las alas de una mariposa en brasil provoca un tornado en texas

2577387 i believe a lot of incredible things the most incredible thing i believe is the christmas story that little baby born in the manger was the god that created the universe
2577388 its too late for monika to come to beijing now and take part in the olympic games because we have closed the entry process
2577389 monika just cannot take part the organisers have not accepted her entry and i dont see her competing here her name has been withdrawn and she will not be allowed to enter the olympic village
2577390 i am pretty surprised i didnt think that id be first to get it not until the finals
2577391 doamne nu mi vine s cred o via ntreag am a teptat acest moment
2577392 by sunday evening we will decide on the date and venue of the final and the third fourth place playoff after a final inspection is done
2577393 the ground condition is awful and we dont want the final of such an important tournament to be decided by the stroke of luck rather than footballing abilities a deferment of one month or two months will disrupt indias domestic schedule so i think this is comparatively better
2577394 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
2577395 if you have a green party i want to join
2577396 entonces no se me ofreci garant a de una plaza al final de mi contrato adem s la universidad en la que actualmente trabajo me proporciona otras cosas impensables en instituciones y centros espa oles como posibilidades de ascenso y una infraestructura de investigaci n puntera se me remuneran debidamente mis logros con subidas extras de sueldo
2577397 porque se les reconocen mucho m s sus m ritos en investigaci n y se les acepta por estos y no por sus contactos
2577398 volver a tu pa s es siempre un aliciente pero significar a perder un tercio de mi sueldo adem s de la libertad y autonom a de la que gozo en manchester donde cuento con mi propio equipo de investigaci n pasar a a depender de un catedr tico o de un jefe de departamento que en ocasiones incluso tiene un curr culo inferior al m o
2577399 tambi n me preocupa que no haya un reglamento claro sobre c mo escalar puestos ni tampoco incentivos econ micos un ejemplo es que nosotros no tenemos derecho a los complementos salariales que puede tener un ayudante doctor y que no nos promocionan antes de que transcurran los cinco a os porque entonces pierden las ayudas econ micas que supone el programa
2577400 si un cient fico tiene un curr culo brillante en el extranjero y se le quiere convencer para que regrese a espa a se le debe dar una oferta atractiva y razonable lo m nimo es aparte de una plaza fija una infraestructura decente nadie con una carrera establecida estar a dispuesto a aceptar estas condiciones por mi parte mantengo que espa a est a a os luz de reino unido
2577401 en el csic hay un investigador al que le queda un a o de contrato y acaba de recibir bastante dinero de europa por un proyecto que acaba de presentar pero el csic le ha rechazado la investigaci n porque s lo le queda un a o de contrato
2577402 la financiaci n de las universidades deber a ligarse a objetivos de investigaci n y no s lo a alumnos egresados as se lograr a un mayor compromiso por parte de las instituciones
2577403 es una pena ver que se entrena a gente muy buena en nuestro pa s y que luego otros pa ses se aprovechan de sus cerebros como espa ol que adora su gente y su cultura esto me duele mucho
2577404 es cierto que desde el gobierno se est haciendo todo lo posible por estabilizar laboralmente a los investigadores
2577405 aparte de iniciativas como i3 programa que incentiva los contratos estables a investigadores pagando los tres primeros a os de sueldo se est pensando en trabajar con alguno de los cajales mediante l neas independientes de financiaci n
2577406 we are fighting a machine that has 500 million dollars even with that money both parties have come together to keep us off the ballot to white us out of the media
2577407 i really believe that if people knew what we stand for that that five percent that we need that five percent that the green party needs to be a major party and pull down federal matching funds and financing would happen
2577408 and as i tell a lot of people if five percent is the difference between obama and mccain mccain and obama then what the fuck are they doing they got 500 million dollars and the green party can fuck up their shit thats serious right there
2577409 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
2577410 if you have a green party i want to join
2577411 pido a todos que vayan a votar porque en democracia no tenemos derecho a quejarnos si no participamos la votaci n de todos es fundamental
2577412 la votaci n de ma ana es vital para determinar si el mas logra o no imponer una constituci n que nos hunde por los pr ximos 25 a os es de vida o muerte ir a votar y yo pido que lo hagan
2577413 nu am primit niciun ultimatum din partea conducerii i nici nu mi voi da demisia

2577416 extrapolar los datos experimentales con virus a evoluci n en general es mucho extrapolar
2577417 for nietzsche the idea that the struggle of life can be explained as a competition a war of all against all ignores the immense amount of co operation in the struggle simultaneous co operation and competition because this struggle is not to preserve ones life but rather in the main to achieve power my idea is that every specific body strives to become master over all space and to extend its force its will to power and to thrust back all that resists its extension
2577418 to date science has not produced a mechanistic description of how power relationships operate that would allow us to investigate nietzsches criticisms of darwin experimentally
2577419 mutants distinguished by a lower replication component may outnumber those distinguished by the highest component but the main point is that this happens within the structure of internal interaction relationships and in particular within the structure of nietzschean power relationships and not as a result of a comparison selection process
2577420 eat natural foods the only supplement i take is an all natural dehydrated fruit and vegetable formula called juice plus im a seafood vegetarian meaning that the only meat i eat is seafood and i eat lots of fruits and vegetables soy products and whole grains you probably dont eat enough fruits and vegetables if you are struggling with your flexibility your total overall diet is the key thing to focus on if youre eating junk food all day long supplements wont do you much good at all most of us are eating more junk than we really need to cause its cheaper and available on every street corner every meal you eat should be healthy and loaded with some combination of fruits vegetables and whole grains for protein go with soy products beans nuts and fish red meat poultry and eggs will slow you down anyways this is basically how i eat i had all kinds of joint problems in my 20s and now in my early 30s my joint problems are gone i do pretty much all the same type of moves including plenty of power if you eat a more natural diet over time your body will definitely thank you it might take a few months a year or a few years for the changes to take effect all depending on how poorly you have been feeding yourself have patience and give your body time to flush out the garbage and absorb the new good stuff your cells knows exactly how to fix themselves and stay super strong if you just feed them good healthy food dont forget to drink plenty of fresh water every day and stay away from anything that has high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated oils lots of food has it even a simple loaf of bread read your labels like i said you gotta put yourself into a natural state of mind americas food industry doesnt really care about your health you have to look out for yourself if you want to be the best b boy you can be you might as well eat a good diet
2577421 your body derives the dominant portion of its energy from carbohydrates followed by fat
2577422 you are invited to attend a public hearing regarding a 14 bed residential treatment facility location to be 1270 cr 2293 cleveland tx 77327 liberty county tarkington isd
2577423 we feel this facility is being slipped by the community
2577424 they havent canvassed any of the neighbors to see if they wanted to be friendly neighbors
2577425 we know the need for a juvenile treatment facility is there
2577426 but its not going to benefit our community these kids are going to come from all over
2577427 our school district is going to be liable for their education
2577428 would put an unfair burden on our small school district as our district would be required to educate these children
2577429 if they come with 14 regular ed students it wouldnt be a problem if they have 14 special ed students well have to hire staff
2577430 one of the school board members called the superintendent of schools called mr wheeler called and a lady called to ask if i had a website but thats it
2577431 everybodys got the option to call me if they call me we could defuse the situation
2577432 im trying to name an emotional disorder maybe depression or anxiety would qualify
2577433 its a matter of public record what im licensed for i understand that people would see my name as a therapy provider for sex offenders and think im going to bring sex offenders to their community but thats not what im doing
2577434 you dont really know what type of child youre getting in advance
2577435 my objective was to look for a wholesome rural environment and remove them the children to be placed with the facility from a chaotic environment
2577436 the quiet underhanded way in which this facility has been planned is very disturbing
2577437 was bought as a weekender and it was used as a weekender then i thought why not do something meaningful with my practice and do something more fulfilling
2577438 having known the former owners we know for a fact there have been problems with the well and septic system

2577667 be bold enough to find the one thing that you are passionate about it might not be what you were trained to do but be bold enough to do the one thing nobody needs to dig it but you
2577668 without passion you have no energy and without energy you have nothing
2577669 all they needed to know is that i would light it up day after day passion is not something you have to talk about people feel it they see it just as clearly as the color of your eyes baby

2577671 4 out of 5 churches grow by taking people from other churches
2577672 working as a team to turn irreligious people into fully devoted followers of christ
2577673 we are not looking to borrow believers from other churches we are looking to attract those that slept in and missed church

2577675 the best senses are integrated that is they appeal to more than one sense at a time
2577676 my woman and my dawg left me and all i have left is my gun and this truck

2577679 spiritual growth is seeing the characteristics of god when you look in the mirror what you wrote about god you see in your own life
2577680 pastor rick it would be helpful if i could sit down with some others and discuss the implications of your message today you said so much i need to digest it
2577681 they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and to the fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer all the believers were together and had everything in common every day they continued to meet together they broke bread in their homes and ate together and the lord added to their number daily those who were being saved
2577682 day after day in the temple courts and from house to house they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that jesus is the christ

2577714 the whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves but wiser people so full of doubts
2577715 so far as i can remember there is not one word in the gospels in praise of intelligence
2577716 the infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists that is why they invented hell
2577717 it is possible that mankind is on the threshold of a golden age but if so it will be necessary first to slay the dragon that guards the door and this dragon is religion
2577718 many a man will have the courage to die gallantly but will not have the courage to say or even to think that the cause for which he is asked to die is an unworthy one
2577719 religions which condemn the pleasures of sense drive men to seek the pleasures of power throughout history power has been the vice of the ascetic

2577722 my first two years here i didnt feel like i could talk to him
2577723 it always seemed like he wanted everything done his way he always got you to believe that what he wanted was right i just felt like sometimes he wanted to clone people and try to make people the same way i think were all different and we need different things to get problems solved
2577724 all these guys have to have a voice and i dont think they did have a voice there was only one voice
2577725 they do a lot more speaking than i do thats the first thing i told them i dont want a bunch of clones i want five different looking starters i want you guys to be who you are and well adjust to that ill adjust to you you dont adjust to me
2577726 i had a great relationship with rick before but you can see this is different
2577727 the guys are much looser they feel more comfortable with rick there was always a lot of numbers and other stuff this is more about being yourself

2577734 as more and more computing tasks migrate to supercomputer style clusters there is a need for software that can effectively utilize and manage the large number of processors found in these systems
2577735 all the actuaries all the objective scorekeepers of the federal government are predicting this
2577736 they say we are 53 trillion short of fulfilling the promises the government is making to the american people in todays dollars
2577737 meaning that if we want to keep the promises of medicare medicaid and social security which are basically the three major entitlement programs today we would have to set aside 53 trillion dollars and invest them at treasury rates in order to do it
2577738 for the last 40 years the federal government has had to tax every dollar made in america at 18 3 cents on that dollar to pay the bills of the federal government
2577739 by the time my three children who are three five and six years old are my age the federal government will have to tax 40 cents out of every dollar made in america just to pay the bills for the federal government at that time
2577740 they said that the current low rate the 10 percent bracket for low income americans would have to go up to 25 percent the middle income tax rate for middle income americans would have to go up to 66 percent and the top rate which is what small businesses pay would have to go to 88 percent
2577741 those would be the tax rates you would have to have if you wanted to tax your way out of this problem
2577742 and if you did that all experts conclude you would literally crash the american economy
2577743 the legacy of this country has always been that each generation confronts the challenges before it so that the next generation is better off
2577744 in the past we brought down the iron curtain and won the cold war we got through world war i we got through world war ii we won the war on the great depression
2577745 the problem that we have right now putting foreign policy aside and our fight with islamic radicalism is that we have an economic crisis we have a fiscal crisis and that is we will bankrupt this country and the best century in america will be the last century
2577746 unless we turn our fiscal situation around and pay off this debt and change the way these programs work to a more sustainable path the next generation will have inferior living standards

2577776 asest un duro golpe a la integridad territorial de georgia

2577796 hey look a dq orange julius place how does that sound
2577797 my take is kind of an extrapolation it actually deals with a nephew of the first character its got some of the characters from the h g wells book but its kind of a continuation
2577798 im in the process of doing invisible man right now and im working with some conceptual artists in tandem with writing the script
2577799 rama is a great conceptual artist who worked on batman begins and the dark knight hes one of the primary conceptual artists who worked on the bat suits
2577800 and if you dont exactly know what steam punk is and why its cool well let
2577801 i dont want to give too much away but i took what being invisible could mean to the next logical extreme we do a lot of crazy things in it that are sort of far beyond what anyones done with it yet
2577802 i agree with you about the fake cops but otoh its not clear what good aring griefers does they have nothing invested in the sl accounts they use to grief i dont equate griefing with terrorism but like terrorists griefers dont care if their account gets banned they simply create another and carry on

2577868 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2577869 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

2577871 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2577872 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2577873 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2577874 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2577875 prayer is never an acceptable substitute for obedience the sovereign lord accepts no offering from his creatures that is not accompanied by obedience to pray for revival while ignoring or actually flouting the plain precept laid down in the scriptures is to waste a lot of words and get nothing for our trouble

2577878 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2577879 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2577880 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2577881 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2577882 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2577883 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2577884 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2577885 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2577886 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2577887 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2577888 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2577889 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2577890 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2577891 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2577892 who are open to doing something on the production side
2577893 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2577894 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2577895 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2577896 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2577897 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2577898 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2577899 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2577900 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2577901 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2577902 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2577903 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2577904 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2577905 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2577906 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2577907 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2577908 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2577909 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2577910 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2577911 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2577912 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2577913 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2577914 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2577915 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2577916 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2577917 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2577918 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2577919 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2577920 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2577921 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2577922 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2577923 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2577924 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2577925 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2577926 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2577927 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2577928 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2577929 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2577930 obviously it turns a defining element of his biography his reputation as a devoted family man upside down
2577931 but if he shows a continued commitment to his core issues and no additional facts emerge that contradict his story he could eventually join the disturbingly large club of public figures whove rebounded from similar events
2577932 i dont think anythings ended my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2577933 the response has been far disproportionate from whatever threat russia was citing
2577934 we are calling for an immediate cease fire and a stand down of all troops
2577935 i cannot for the life of me imagine how that could be a proportional response
2577936 the only winning option for russia is to cease the attacks
2577937 it is simply not acceptable to reject an offer of a cease fire and international mediation
2577938 the georgian president has not sent any proposals to the russian president though any channels
2577939 one is the withdrawal of all georgian forces from the conflict zone
2577940 and the second is an immediate signing of a binding agreement on the non use of force after that we could discuss all further issues
2577941 we are not talking about anything beyond diplomacy at this point
2577942 many people speculate one of the reasons russia has used this disproportionate force against georgia is precisely because it does not want to see georgia move towards nato
2577943 yesterday i finished very mad with my round and now after these 18 holes i cant believe it i have a chance tomorrow
2577944 the greens were a bit softer and i played great golf hitting fairways and greens the whole round
2577945 the fairways are perfect the greens are hard but they are a good speed and the rough you can hit some shots from there
2577946 i like the course and today i could make a very good round even in those conditions
2577947 i knew i could really compete with all these guys and i was up to their level
2577948 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2577949 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2577950 yesterday i finished very nice with my round and now after this 18 holes i cant believe it i have a chance for tomorrow and well i have to wait but its great to be here
2577951 i played a great first shot then a perfect 9 iron from 140 yards
2577952 it bounced in the front of the green but like the wind blows just in the moment and it went down to the water
2577953 then again i had tried to make a good shot but again a lot of back spin again to the water and after that i got mad and i played very dis concentrated not very concentrated the whole rest of the round
2577954 i couldnt come back after that eight i made a double bogey at the 18th because i was mad and then i was almost fighting for the lead in the tournament and suddenly i was trying to make the cut so i was going mad the rest of the round
2577955 i won in germany at the next weeks deutsche bank players championship of europe and the following week i finished sixth in the bridgestone and that helped me a lot not to i dont know not to go down after that loss
2577956 and i know that you love me because you didnt want me to get hurt
2577957 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement for our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed

2577974 we are very excited to bring lisa on board here at arkansas state
2577975 she brings a ton of energy and enthusiasm she also brings a great amount of experience to asu after being involved with a top program at minnesota i think that having that big school mentality will help our players realize what it takes to continue to raise our program to the next level
2577976 she is already looking for ways to get our kids out in the community and help raise the awareness of soccer in the jonesboro area
2577977 my experience with helping to rebuild the program at minnesota and seeing the processes involved with that will really fit well with arkansas state
2577978 there is so much potential here with the facilities staff and community support the players have bought into wanting to build a really solid program as well coach pittman and i work well together have similar ideas and will complement each other as a staff

2578100 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2578101 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2578102 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2578103 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2578104 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2578113 we are dealing with absolutely criminal and crazy acts of irresponsible and reckless decision makers which is on the ground producing dramatic and tragic consequences
2578114 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia

2578139 at first the melody would come and walk with me through the mists in north cornwall england i would take this melody back to the hammond organ the b3 i would sit and play with this for hours soon i began to have to deal with my mothers heart condition and she survived a cardiac arrest in september because of this i began thinking about the life cycle and that dying is part of the life cycle even though i realized this logically i couldnt accept the idea of losing my mother emotionally the song started to become clearer as the days went by and i began to realize that the beekeeper that had taken my character in the song to death to plead for my mothers life the queen bee in the song little did i know that although my mother would survive and that death did pass her by it would be the last time i saw my brother when i went back to stand by my mothers bedside so life death has its own rhythm and its own rhyme the beekeeper really acts as a shaman similar to the medicine man in the native american tradition we have the beekeeper in the celtic tradition
2578140 i met a girl who sang the blues and i asked her for some happy news but she just smiled and turned away i went down to the sacred store where id heard the music years before but the man there said the music wouldnt play

2578182 all we can do is move forward without engaging in further discrimination toward any race
2578183 well his record gives me pause but at least hes not black
2578184 move forward without engaging in further discrimination toward any race
2578185 as long as everyone says theyre not discriminating surely its ok
2578186 i agree with argument but believe strongly that affirmative action should be class based because that is fair and right and most likely to be effective
2578187 american blacks live better than blacks in almost any part of the world
2578188 the costs to a particular white individual from aa may exceed the benefit he gets from past current discrimination against blacks

2578191 here is fellowship on the cheap scarfing down hot dogs and cheering for fireworks on the fourth of july despite the fact that said commenters forbears did absolutely nothing to liberate the country while slinking away when the subject of slavery or jim crow arises

2578194 jim crow wasnt simply a crime against black people it was a crime against the american future
2578195 guess who wasnt being hired in those days by the gas company
2578196 sorry i gve the job to nancy over there because of the higher melanin content of her skin
2578197 you know i really didnt deserve to get that job bob over there was much more qualified
2578198 you want it to be one way but its the other way
2578199 sorry i gve the job to nancy over there because of the higher melanin content of her skin
2578200 jim crow wasnt simply a crime against black people it was a crime against the american future
2578201 we all share a vital stake in the education of citizens and leaders for a diverse society i am pleased the court has affirmed policies like ours that promote compelling educational interests in inclusiveness we will continue to pursue those interests with energy and care so we can provide our students with the best possible education and prepare them to contribute to society
2578202 favoring people on the basis of their race has been a terrible social and political problem in u s history
2578203 did not contemplate that any single characteristic automatically ensured a specific and identifiable contribution to a universitys diversity
2578204 is flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant and to place them on the same footing for consideration although not necessarily according them the same weight
2578205 you mentioned this earlier and i didnt say anything because i thought you were referring to resentment about the fact that this has happened but now youre using the present tense and i have to step in the points system in racial preferences is illegal and has been since gratz v bollinger in 2003 what you are describing simply doesnt happen anymore
2578206 favoring people on the basis of their race has been a terrible social and political problem in u s history
2578207 the only reason that asians are more disadvantaged by racial preferences than whites is that they are much less likely to benefit from preferential policies that for some reason we dont call
2578208 id rather reject students on the academic borderline to achieve a diverse student body than to make sure the next generation of bushes will get to be in skull and bones thats the only defense ive got
2578209 but the forest is made up of aspens conifers and firs not pines
2578210 the large benefit accrued to black applicants in my example is a function of their rarity
2578211 but as so many others have said the racial preference is not there in order to help that black kid get a harvard degree because hell be so much worse off with one from say uva its there for harvard which wants a student body that reflects the top students from across the spectrum of american society harvards not in business to satisfy every white kid who thinks his test scores should have gotten him in its in business to achieve what it defines as the goals of a premier educational institution one of which is to equip its students to live in a diverse society
2578212 yes jim crow was a crime against the american future but is it a crime that justifies discriminating against asian people based solely on the color of their skin
2578213 you came to this country so deal with it the problem with that response is that they not only didnt do it they might not believe that racial discrimination now is a great way to deal with it posted by sebastian august 7 2008 5 24 pm
2578214 a few asian immigrant groups do suffer from poverty and lack of educational opportunity hmong and cambodians maybe some filipino families as well although my understanding was in general filipino immgrants are quite well educated
2578215 i dont have much of a problem with positive discrimination in favor of disadvantaged groups but then again i dont share the liberal rights based idea that we can all freely choose our identity and that group identity is secondary so it isnt such an intellectual problem for me posted by hector august 7 2008 10 38 pm

2578217 a few asian immigrant groups do suffer from poverty and lack of educational opportunity
2578218 black students who are standouts in almost any crowd but who are not quite as qualified as some of the white and asian students they beat out
2578219 the reality is that society was built by anchoring black folks at the bottom
2578220 characteristic of the left side of the modern american political spectrum
2578221 bill clinton used to say things similar to this he would say and i paraphrase if you cant think of young black and latino men as your brothers think of them as folks whose labor and taxes we need to keep social security functioning
2578222 either youre an american or you are not if you are welcome to the family the entire family
2578223 um i know quite a few black people who emigrated here from various caribbean countries and have suggested to me that they were better off back home perhaps poorer money wise but better off in terms of safety an educational system that was not totally dysfunctional more of a sense of community and less social and moral alienation

2578225 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know

2578227 of the 50 top performing funds in 2000 not a single one appeard on the list in either 1999 or 1998
2578228 using past performance numbers as a method for choosing mutual funds is such a lousy idea that mutual fund companies are required by law to tell you it is a lousy idea

2578452 mr pickens challenged the public to come to a meeting and voice their opinions on how stupid this discussion is and im just curious when we can do that
2578453 at the next meeting or today if they are here
2578454 i dont think i should comment in the event its politically motivated
2578455 the circuit court has patiently awaited the renovations of the courthouse and consented to the temporary move to accommodate the county the docket has suffered from lack of space i just hope the actions by the supervisors do not permanently affect the courts ability to do business unless alternate space is made available
2578456 maybe we can work it out where everyone can live with it
2578457 i may not agree with everything the previous board did but i will uphold their integrity
2578458 they signed those applications for those grants and thats what the building should be used for
2578459 is a waste of taxpayer dollars and jeopardizes the safety of the public
2578460 millions of taxpayer dollars have been spent to renovate the courthouse specifically for the circuit court
2578461 its the most ridiculous thing ive heard come down the pike in the 52 years ive practiced law here
2578462 this is the courthouse its where court has always been held for it not to be a courthouse is sacrilegious and i dont understand their motivation
2578463 they spent a lot of money designing the historic courthouse to be used for that purpose with special facilities for keeping criminals and accused criminals separate from the general population
2578464 it worked for a short period of time because it had to
2578465 for a long period of time it is not functional
2578466 but above all the courthouse the center the focus the hub musing brooding symbolic and ponderable protector of the weak

2578472 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2578473 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2578474 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2578475 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2578476 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2578477 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2578478 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2578479 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2578497 if its easy to park at autolib stations i would use that
2578498 and i would definitely prefer to drive a car that doesnt pollute
2578499 its true that not everyone can afford to buy their own car so it could be very useful
2578500 today we have consumer habits whether its going to ikea or elsewhere which necessitate that once in a while even those who cant afford cars need to use one and in this sense i think this will complement public transportation
2578501 we should be open to this type of initiative knowing that there is not one solution to the problems of transportation and climate change
2578502 from the moment i knew that my arm was to be amputated i accepted the fact i have always relied on myself its what has helped me continue to lead a normal life
2578503 it will happen in the normal course of life it doesnt worry me
2578504 if the government heard the jurys message it will not use a flawed war court to prosecute conduct that does not violate the laws of war
2578505 the lesson i hope the government learns from this case among other things is dont bring skimpy or weak charges of conspiracy
2578506 creative capitalism isnt some big new economic theory it is a way to answer a vital question how can we most effectively spread the benefits of capitalism and the huge improvements in quality of life it can provide to people who have been left out

2578510 for children in general the level of anxiety of the mother is a very good predictor of the level of timidity and anxiety in the offspring
2578511 you dont need to start talking about people in war zones or suffering serious mental health problems before you start seeing these effects
2578512 for some kids good parents are substantially more important than for others
2578513 when you look at children who are more difficult for those children parental skills are critical
2578514 if you have an easygoing happy baby these kids are essentially just add water
2578515 the problem is that the population of kids who are temperamentally difficult are born to parents least able to deal with them
2578516 we pray for the intercession of our mother mary that she may grant the families peace in knowing that their loved ones are now with her son jesus

2578557 the americans bombs are not the answer the two sides will have to sit down and talk some day so the only question is how many of us have to get killed before that happens
2578558 yes this would be a big price to pay but if they lay down their guns and accept the constitution why not after all people with the same attitudes are already in the government what is happening at the moment is worse because while the conflict continues our whole society is being talibanised and corrupted

2578575 it is very difficult to say when this is going to stop
2578576 there is less material being emitted but the volcano could reactivate at any moment
2578577 the volcano is part of nature and this part of southern chile is full of volcanoes
2578578 i am not afraid of the volcano and neither is my family we came back to work to reconstruct our house and our town we are hopeful that our town will survive
2578579 it is just a matter of time for a lot of little towns in chile
2578580 we have to wait until the volcano stops being active to see what can be saved and what cannot
2578581 this is an uncertain scenario and people need to make their own decisions
2578582 they are feeling desperate and depressed right now most still want to go back
2578583 volcanoes are a part of nature you cant worry about them
2578584 i need to get back to the country to my cattle it is what i know where i belong

2578591 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2578592 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for the end of the russian bombings
2578593 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2578594 they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives are being lost and others are in danger
2578595 we still believe that a unified and consolidated western pressure and western opinion can bring some fruit
2578596 thwart its neighbors movement toward western society and western values
2578597 russia has clearly decided to redraw the borders of the eastern europe map of the post cold war situation
2578598 if the world is not able to stop russia here then russian tanks and russian paratroopers can appear in every european capital
2578599 we have been appreciative of the american efforts to pacify the hawks in tbilisi
2578600 what we didnt expect was that russian troops themselves would enter georgia that russian military equipment would bomb our cities in various parts of the country that russian soldiers would be shelling villages and positions of georgian forces
2578601 those responsible for the humanitarian catastrophe in south ossetia should be brought to justice including before international law
2578602 russia has launched a full scale military operation on air land and sea we have entered a totally new realm politically legally and diplomatically
2578603 we dont carry out hostilities against populated settlements and civilian objects
2578604 i know this information and statements of the georgian side but we currently dont confirm it
2578605 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now

2578618 how do i burn a music cd in windows vista
2578619 i had no idea when you interviewed me that you considered much of my later work to be sentimental rubbish or that you thought songs like uptown girl and we didnt start the fire were abominations and your back slapping buddy buddy style of conversation betrayed no indication that you actually compared talking with me to sleeping with an inflatable girlfriend
2578620 you didnt bring any of this up during the interview and i certainly would have welcomed the opportunity to discuss those kinds of things person to person
2578621 had i known you felt this way i still would have done the bloody interview but your comments reveal you to be already critically predisposed and somewhat insincere you are still welcome to attend our concert in auckland but just as a safety precaution please wear a hockey mask
2578622 ive had letters before from the bass player in some local band who is pissed off because i said his record is crap but ive never had a letter from someone in the big league before its actually made him go up in my estimation
2578623 he just wants respect for his work and i think good on him for making direct contact he was great to talk to and no matter what i think of those songs other people clearly love them because hes sold over 150 million records
2578624 he was undefeated in 21 fights so i do feel fortunate that im not living in new york so he cant come around and smack me one
2578625 something of what happened that awful night two and a half years ago
2578626 just everywhere out here laid out on the ground they are bloody
2578627 we thought it would be better for him to get on the bus because its a far drive
2578628 now he keeps saying that he should have driven himself
2578629 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2578630 i was a college professor and i graduated students that could neither read nor write
2578631 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2578632 it shouldnt be too bad finding a seat here i mean this is
2578633 i looked around and saw at least 5 6 hands raised in just my visible radius i didnt stand up to see the aggregate total of folks who wandered in seemingly off the street with no idea of what they were attending later in the afternoon i mentioned this to
2578634 ok if you dont get her number you have to go to the jruby talk
2578635 give me smoked turkey one pound for the love of god
2578636 i need lean meat because im fat and lots of it because im hungry
2578637 while they will face several challenges but they will overcome these
2578638 how many users do we have how many listings are there how many sales have we made in the past week
2578639 yeah thats a real problem and those are the options in terms of solving it
2578640 hey youre totally on the wrong track how about if you did this instead
2578641 i opened the glove box i turned and i looked again i took my glasses off and looked at it
2578642 its serious if you had seen it youd have said the same thing
2578643 was it dangerous was it a criminal threat or was it just a hoax
2578644 hey did you see buffy the vampire slayer conversations with dead people
2578645 so when we talked about the young jedi who killed his master you meant yourself
2578646 so is that going to be important later or not
2578647 those scientists held a different view so darwin had to justify his theory with evidence
2578648 creationism including intelligent design does not offer a scientific alternative to the theory of evolution by invoking the act of a creator or an intelligent designer as the explanation for lifes diversity creationism invokes a cause that lies outside our powers of observation and thus outside the realm of scientific inquiry
2578649 if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it does it make a sound

2578652 this is just a start fellas were going to get better with this
2578653 nba players shouldnt be allowed to compete in international games during the summer
2578654 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2578655 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2578656 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2578657 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2578658 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2578659 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2578660 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2578661 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2578662 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2578663 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2578664 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2578665 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2578666 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2578667 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2578668 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2578669 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2578670 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2578671 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2578672 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2578673 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2578674 it was a script submitted to me about nine years ago
2578675 at the time it was about a bunch of teenagers who worked in a mall which we thought was an absolutely great concept
2578676 we noticed how to add more and more music and still keep the story moving forward it felt like you got to a certain part of the script and you just went music when i started watching every musical i could trying to understand why i liked them so much i realized music didnt stop the story and added depth to the characters
2578677 a lot of the other cast members had been involved with the project for months doing very intensive auditions
2578678 i got really lucky i had only two auditions in the space of a week then a week later we were ready to shoot
2578679 and i really loved it plus it was an amazing group of people we got along really well in real life
2578680 theres been a lot more of it over the past few years which is really fabulous
2578681 when i was in college moulin rouge came out and my friends and i obsessed over it it was the first musical that had come out in a long long time
2578682 i love playing villains theyre just delicious i try to make every person i play her own character as opposed to oh its just the ingenue i think maggie gyllenhaal does that she makes every part special and not just the girlfriend i admire that
2578683 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2578684 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2578685 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2578686 if one or some of these rmos resident medical officers decided not to rotate it will cause difficulties in providing services
2578687 if none of them rotated wed be all right or if all of them rotate wed be ok but if individuals dont thats when well have problems
2578688 with no meca in place dhbs are offering different terms and conditions
2578689 inevitably this will lead to members preferring one employer over another and being unwilling or alternatively seek to change employer consequently the issue of rotations pursuant to college training requirement will become problematic if members decide they do not wish to move to inferior terms and conditions of employment at a new dhb and challenge the college allocations
2578690 extremely disappointing that the union is misrepresenting the dhbs position in regard to bargaining and the individual employment agreements
2578691 neglects the important differences between a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment program and a reactor based program
2578692 far more military ordinance than that used on either reactor attacked by israel
2578693 acquire centrifuge items abroad often illicitly allowing it to create reserve stocks of critical equipment and raw materials
2578694 intelligence agencies simply lack reliable information on the full scope of irans centrifuge facilities and activities
2578695 considering the modular replicable nature of centrifuge plants we conclude that an attack on irans nuclear program is unlikely to significantly degrade irans ability to reconstitute its gas centrifuge program
2578696 it is time to set aside the military option and concentrate instead on credible diplomatic approaches to end irans growing nuclear weapons capabilities
2578697 given the absence of wood in the miserable tv3 building i allow myself to touch a wood product ie paper because im usually carrying scripts im covered
2578698 sometimes i leave it at home and it feels really odd to do the show without it
2578699 i had lucky silks lucky sticks i always put my right boot on first i always folded the the tags on my towels inwards
2578700 i had a mad mother i was brought up with things like never put shoes on the table even when theyre new i still do those things
2578701 a kind of voice in my head that said he was going to die which he did within a day or two weird
2578702 when the sceptics conference opened on year on a friday 13th we had a ladder parked over the entrance doorway and everyone came through under it we also had a box of mirror glass to break chain mail letters to ignore salt to spill umbrellas to open inside it was the one onference where all the speakers ran to time
2578703 for cultural reasons and often because the money is collected for a good cause
2578704 i got to the point of thinking that being told to be wary of someone simply because they were a scorpio was as distasteful as being told to be wary of samoans or jews
2578705 we can expect to see an upsurge in melanoma rates among maori and pacific islanders as their skin colour lightens
2578706 there was the possibility that early detection and greater public awareness may have had an impact on later development of thick melanoma but so far that is not the case
2578707 regrettably the answer is that we didnt find any decrease
2578708 the problem is that it is often quite difficult to identify thick melanomas early on they tend to have a nodular shape but dont necessarily stick out above the surrounding skin or have an irregular edge theyre not always dark either and can be quite pale and flat
2578709 but we cant worry ourselves into the grave we have to grin and bear it
2578710 we wanted cash out of our property to enjoy life
2578711 families are telling us they are cutting their food bill and trying to make the food go further
2578712 its not right that a homeowner small businessman or farmer can be prosecuted for breaching their resource consent but that the government puts itself above the law
2578713 the irony is that the ministry is responsible for the administration of the rma and ensuring compliance of over 300 000 consents the one consent it holds it breaches knowingly and seriously
2578714 i dont think mfe or the department of conservation or anybody should be beyond the realms of actions that are available to any other citizen in the community
2578715 but there was no way we could afford 1200 a day plus expenses
2578716 its much more difficult for couples to sell homes unless they are selling at a loss
2578717 if a couple had separated two years ago and if they hadnt long bought a home the chances are it would have gone up in value now you might get couples who are trying to sell a home that has dropped in value so they dont really have any equity in it
2578718 couples breaking up or on the more positive side getting together is a significant driver of real estate transactions anecdotally we say that one in five property sales has something to do with a marriage issue
2578719 theyre having to wait longer than they would have if they had separated two years ago to get a price they both think is appropriate in a broken relationship they may not persevere for a higher price for as long because of the emotional stress of being under the same roof
2578720 the other edge of the sword is that with the reduction in the value of the property the amount of equity left in the home becomes much more marginal
2578721 tony would let her in and say kristin honey what are you doing here then she would leave and come back and bang on the door again he was trying to do the diplomatic thing and say youre upset you need to go home
2578722 i just thought everyone has issues but the relationship was fine they were cool
2578723 is enough is enough i believe tony was a victim of her behaviour
2578724 he is a really nice guy he is the person that everyone thought he was before this came out
2578725 i never saw him be aggressive towards her he is not a violent person
2578726 she was walking cautiously but she was not in a wheelchair
2578727 i observed a couple in love they would go to clubs and bars they were a normal couple
2578728 descended into a state of deep depression anxiety and emotional paralysis
2578729 i had no job and i was in such a bad way that i was operating at some pretty primal survival level
2578730 remember how they did those experiments on baby monkeys where they put them in wire cages with fur around the wire and every time they wanted to be nurtured they got hit thats what it felt like to be in this relationship
2578731 the team leader frequently referred to my weight and physical characteristics and i became increasingly isolated and tearful
2578732 i kind of lost respect for my profession i found that the kind people were few and far between i was trying to do the best for people
2578733 there is a very judgemental part of the profession and the fact that i was president of the society kind of made it more exciting for them to oust me
2578734 i think i kept on trying because he was so hurt by life he was so charming at first he could be so beautiful so spiritual he cooked for me and at times he was caring we talked of love and a relationship he asked me to marry him
2578735 he knew all the right things to say and i used to believe him until i would get this icy blast of reality
2578736 he threatened to stab me in the heart he punched me in the head
2578737 they want him in the ocean they thought he was going to kill me and they didnt want to come to my tangi but they dont realise i still have incredible feelings for him
2578738 i was angry at her for calling the police because it resulted in him being put in jail for breaching his parole conditions but she had to do something
2578739 the time might not be too far away where if the international game continues to grow where the players might be contracted to a controlling body
2578740 i am going to explore that i think if we can do something along that line then we are heading in the right direction but to do it you have to generate the revenue
2578741 i made up my mind at 24 0 against us
2578742 i certainly couldnt walk away i wasnt worried about the next 60 minutes i had made my mind up that i just wasnt going to walk away at 24 0
2578743 i dont talk a lot when i dont have to
2578744 but it would have been nice to know for sure by now
2578745 i stand by my convictions and if they want to send me to jail for what i believe in then so be it
2578746 i would only recognise a french court and i only take my orders from the international rugby board and the french rugby federation
2578747 the only problem might have been if the bulldogs had asked for a release letter but there has been no release letter asked for at all
2578748 if there is no request for an exit letter there is no recognition of a former contract
2578749 hes signed his contract with toulon hes played a game and hes with us
2578750 he has decided to stop playing rugby league and start playing the 15 a side game to realise a new dream of playing for the all blacks and learning about rugby union with toulon coach and ex all blacks captain tana umaga

2578752 is this another skeleton in the democratic closet that barack obama must struggle to overcome
2578753 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2578754 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2578755 obviously it turns a defining element of his biography his reputation as a devoted family man upside down
2578756 but if he shows a continued commitment to his core issues and no additional facts emerge that contradict his story he could eventually join the disturbingly large club of public figures whove rebounded from similar events
2578757 i dont think anythings ended my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on

2578760 the challenge has been to come up with a distribution plan
2578761 there is an agreement to use five trucks that will work for eight hours to deliver water to the residents
2578762 we are suffering a lot due to this problem especially in summer water is very vital to us and we hope that further measures are taken to lessen our suffering
2578763 weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate
2578764 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past to study these deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
2578765 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903

2578774 a farming experiment at the university of california davis has found that organically grown tomatoes are richer in certain kinds of flavonoids than conventionally grown tomatoes and one researcher is curious to determine why this may be so far the researchers have found that the organic tomatoes have almost double the concentration of two types of flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol which are considered to be healthful plant compounds with potent antioxidant activity the 10 year mean levels of quercetin were 79 percent higher than those in conventional tomatoes and levels of kaempferol were 97 percent higher
2578775 i was climbing a long ridge west of mt clark it was one of those mornings when the sunlight is burnished with a keen wind and long feathers of cloud move in the lofty sky the silver light turned every blade of grass and every particle of sand into a luminous metallic splendor there was nothing however small that did not clash in the bright wind that did not send arrows of light through the glassy air i was suddenly arrested in the long crunching path of the ridge by an exceedingly pointed awareness of the light the moment i paused the full impact of the mood was upon me i saw more clearly than ive ever seen before or since the minute details of the grasses the small flotsam of the forest the motion of the high clouds streaming above the peaks i dreamed that for a moment time stood quiet and the vision became but the shadow of an infinitely greater world and i had within the grasp of consciousness a transcendental experience
2578776 a strange thing happened to me today i saw a big thundercloud move down over half dome and it was so big and clear and brilliant that it made me see many things that were drifting around inside of me things that relate to those who are loved and those who are real friends for the first time i know what love is what friends are and what art should be love is a seeking for a way of life the way that cannot be followed alone the resonance of all spiritual and physical things friendship is another form of love more passive perhaps but full of the transmitting and acceptances of things like thunderclouds and grass and the clean granite of reality art is both love and friendship and understanding the desire to give it is not charity which is the giving of things it is more than kindness which is the giving of self it is both the taking and giving of beauty the turning out to the light of the inner folds of the awareness of the spirit it is a recreation on another plane of the realities of the world the tragic and wonderful realities of earth and men and of all the interrelations of these
2578777 a homeschooling family in southern germany spent six hours in a grueling german family court session this week with the hopes of regaining custody of their six homeschooled children who have been held in state custody since january
2578778 bedlam in the courtroom without any attempt by the judge to impose discipline the parties kept interrupting each other and everyone spoke at once
2578779 you wont have to worry about paying the fine because im going to send you to jail
2578780 we are greatly encouraged by the thoughts and prayers of american homeschoolers
2578781 it gives us hope to know that there are people who have the freedom to educate their own children at home we so appreciate the letters and notes of encouragement these letters help us maintain our focus and in seeking gods will for our family
2578782 germanys approach to home schooling compromises this european law on mobility and forces families to choose between a job and the best interests of the children the need for family friendly employment policies must be recognized throughout the eu we need to have flexibility in the education of children temporarily resident because of work there is also an issue around the attitude to non german families in the german childrens courts i hope the dialogue between the commission and the german state will resolve this discriminatory situation
2578783 imprisonment or fines in this matter are absolutely excessive in my opinion because homeschooling can provide very high quality outcomes this topic is definitely one which we must work through politically there can be no black white declarations but we must discuss this without ideological blinders on
2578784 this poor simple family is being crushed by unbearable pressure from the german states police power primarily because they are homeschoolers
2578785 this father of nine a woodworker told me how difficult this is and the incredible strain its placing on his children his wife and himself as longtime homeschoolers they have irritated the local youth authorities who needed only the pretext of the hospitalization of the mother and other exaggerated claims to seize the children
2578786 while there are some policy makers in some of the states who are willing to take on this important issue of human rights most couldnt be bothered it is going to take increased public awareness and international pressure to confront german society with this outrageous behavior unfortunately it looks like more parents will have to go to jail and more children taken into state custody before german public policy makers wake up and do something its very disturbing that germany can get away with this kind of behavior with such little public comment by other western governments

2578794 i certainly encourage married couples to pray for a good and happy sex life its a way for them to become closer to god
2578795 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
2578796 if you believe in god then you believe god is involved in life in love marriage and in sex and sexuality it seems natural to talk about sex to remove taboos and the label of sinfulness
2578797 love between a married couple expressed in sex brings the human body closer to heaven the ecstasy in the joy of sexual intercourse can be likened to the joy of eternal life
2578798 this is why the conjugal act allows spouses to begin to understand the sweetness of encountering god
2578799 concentration on the physiological side of a sexual intercourse causes reduction of its most important elements
2578800 when a woman is excited she wants to experience absolute pleasure as much as a man does
2578801 the feeling of sexual dissatisfaction for a woman who is already excited is a great physical and psychological suffering
2578802 i look at it this way you dont have to have a heart condition to be a cardiologist and you dont have to be an alcoholic to work as a therapist
2578803 the holy fathers theology of the body and other philosophical and theological works delve deeply into the divinity of sexual relations in marriage im just making these complex ideas more accessible to average catholics
2578804 the workshops with father knotz really helped us to overcome our inhibitions and guilt regarding sex
2578805 he really listens to couples and this is why i think he understands us so well
2578806 its a novel approach which in my experience helps couples achieve greater intimacy so why not
2578807 i have told these 22 players that they will be involved next weekend and i would like to keep it that way
2578808 there is no doubt in their minds about whether they will be playing or not and that is positive for this squad however if injuries mean we have to bring new players in well that is something that is beyond our control and we will have to handle that as it arises
2578809 i was happy with the win and if you say but for the first 30 minutes where the boks trailed 9 0 then we must realise that life is not perfect and that these things happen we were happy with the result and that is that
2578810 we went out with the mindset to play some rugby and we perhaps made a few to many 50 50 passes and got some turnovers against us for that
2578811 but you must remember we were playing against a side who are in the top four in the world and who made the semi finals of the rugby world cup last year
2578812 but from then on things seemed to stick and everything went well for us as we found our finishing touch
2578813 el representante legal de la empresa automatic entertaiment antonio zelada confirm que el contrato con la banda estar a por definirse en los pr ximos d as el acuerdo no est cerrado al 100 pero esperamos tenerlo definido a m s tardar el viernes
2578814 what he hoped to be was americas best loved president
2578815 share his presence and shake his hand were a reassurance to him and he expanded in their presence
2578816 brought with him the habits and attitudes of the ohio political jungle the vultures and jackals of the ohio gang the politicians of the lower level moving on to washington flocked to him
2578817 in that while he headed the department of justice he was subject to two congressional investigations
2578818 for a political faction to represent itself as a rebellion against a government for which it is itself responsible may strike you as a supremely cynical maneuver
2578819 if so you are beginning to understand conservative washington cynicism is of this movements essence
2578820 first we want to remove liberal personnel from the political process then we want to capture those positions of power and influence for conservatives stalin taught the importance of this principle he was running the personnel department while trotsky was fighting the white army when push came to shove for control of the soviet union stalin won his people were in place and trotskys werent
2578821 in an interesting development in a texas case against a college age defendant who was 16 at the time of the infringement the judge has

2578823 unfortunately due to the necessity of the technology that enables games to exist as they do today the power that fuels our hobby must also be sacrificial so what price does the environment pay for games with the visual verbosity of something like gears of war 2
2578824 there was nothing to be had to be honest were building everything from the ground up
2578825 youre going to see the actual game working and functioning
2578826 this isnt renders this isnt concept art everything that people will see on sunday is going to be taken right from star trek online as it stands today so hardened people should know that a release date might be closer than they think
2578827 there might be a ship called enterprise flying around but its probably not the same ship anymore
2578828 portals and other distributions services impose their own rules and limitations supposedly indie friendly distribution options like steam and instant action still have subjective gatekeepers
2578829 if you want your game to make money you have to consider what will sell and this means adapting your pure creative vision to match the real world
2578830 since we are a small developer that has a hard time getting attention you would think we would have very little piracy
2578831 unfortunately thats not the case at all its depressing how many sites are pirating depths of peril

2578847 it was simple we never ever used my name we never told anybody it was me who was going to do the interviews we even had a fake title for the film we called it a spiritual journey it didnt work everywhere we went to salk lake city but no one would let us film there at all
2578848 larry charles theory is just keep going till they throw you out i guess he learned that on borat the crew would set up and at the last second when the cameras were already rolling i would show up so either theyd be seen on camera leaving the interview and lose face or theyd have to talk to me it was like and now heres bill you could usually see the troubled looks on their faces at the holy land theme park the pr woman freaked out and finally told us to leave she was definitely not a happy camper

2578969 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2578970 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2578971 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2578972 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2578973 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2578974 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2578977 im definitely open to doing another suburban vigilante although this will be one tough act to follow im sure another sequel will be a topic of discussion in my upcoming contract talks
2578978 we are confident chris will be back on board for more movies with strike force productions he is a cornerstone of our company
2578979 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2578997 actively sought to locate these illegal immigrants and hire them knowing full well that it was in violation of the immigration laws of the united states to do so

2579180 its great news and very important for us to land a slot on this cool festival as we were so disappointed when the lagoa burning live festival in portugal was cancelled recently everyone had such an awesome time on our last visit and we just had to come back to and play once again see you all real soon for a slaughter in the sun
2579181 descended into a state of deep depression anxiety and emotional paralysis
2579182 i had no job and i was in such a bad way that i was operating at some pretty primal survival level
2579183 remember how they did those experiments on baby monkeys where they put them in wire cages with fur around the wire and every time they wanted to be nurtured they got hit thats what it felt like to be in this relationship
2579184 the team leader frequently referred to my weight and physical characteristics and i became increasingly isolated and tearful
2579185 i kind of lost respect for my profession i found that the kind people were few and far between i was trying to do the best for people
2579186 there is a very judgemental part of the profession and the fact that i was president of the society kind of made it more exciting for them to oust me
2579187 i think i kept on trying because he was so hurt by life he was so charming at first he could be so beautiful so spiritual he cooked for me and at times he was caring we talked of love and a relationship he asked me to marry him
2579188 he knew all the right things to say and i used to believe him until i would get this icy blast of reality
2579189 he threatened to stab me in the heart he punched me in the head
2579190 they want him in the ocean they thought he was going to kill me and they didnt want to come to my tangi but they dont realise i still have incredible feelings for him

2579196 for some kids good parents are substantially more important than for others
2579197 when you look at children who are more difficult for those children parental skills are critical
2579198 if you have an easygoing happy baby these kids are essentially just add water
2579199 the problem is that the population of kids who are temperamentally difficult are born to parents least able to deal with them
2579200 families are telling us they are cutting their food bill and trying to make the food go further
2579201 i had no idea when you interviewed me that you considered much of my later work to be sentimental rubbish or that you thought songs like uptown girl and we didnt start the fire were abominations and your back slapping buddy buddy style of conversation betrayed no indication that you actually compared talking with me to sleeping with an inflatable girlfriend
2579202 you didnt bring any of this up during the interview and i certainly would have welcomed the opportunity to discuss those kinds of things person to person
2579203 had i known you felt this way i still would have done the bloody interview but your comments reveal you to be already critically predisposed and somewhat insincere you are still welcome to attend our concert in auckland but just as a safety precaution please wear a hockey mask
2579204 ive had letters before from the bass player in some local band who is pissed off because i said his record is crap but ive never had a letter from someone in the big league before its actually made him go up in my estimation
2579205 he just wants respect for his work and i think good on him for making direct contact he was great to talk to and no matter what i think of those songs other people clearly love them because hes sold over 150 million records
2579206 he was undefeated in 21 fights so i do feel fortunate that im not living in new york so he cant come around and smack me one

2579222 elsie was playing with the gnome and beckoning it to come on to her knee
2579223 the gnome leapt up just as frances who had the camera snapped the shutter he is described as wearing black tights a reddish jersey and a pointed bright red cap
2579224 elsie said there was no perceptible weight though when on the bare hand the feeling is like a little breath the wings were more moth like than the fairies and of a soft neutral tint elsie explained that what seem to be markings on his wings are simply his pipes which he was swinging in his grotesque little left hand

2579230 when oil is extracted from a reservoir between 50 and 75 per cent remains in the ground its likely that better technology would improve that
2579231 even though studies by the national academy of science have shown that oil and gas research is a worthwhile investment in future oil supplies money for it has fallen since the mid 1980s major oil companies have abandoned their expensive research programs partly because oil prices were very low in the 1990s and partly because the industry restructured to focus on profits in the meantime the department of energy has invested less in research in 2005 the bush administration tried to do away with it altogether

2579236 yeah he already got a key to the city too actually he didnt im not saying the value of that key has gone down at all it was quite a warm welcome but i think everybody knows that in new york it doesnt last long thats why its such a great city to play for

2579252 after i hurt you you wrote in the sand and now you carve on a stone why
2579253 when someone hurts us we should write it down in sand where the winds of forgiveness can erase it away but when someone does something good for us we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it

2579344 wal mart and carrefour were not aggressive enough in expanding their networks in south korea
2579345 once they lost the race they could never catch up
2579346 as we continue to focus our efforts where we can have the greatest impact on our growth strategy it became increasingly clear that in south koreas current environment it would be difficult for us to reach the scale we desired
2579347 people can play games with things that have been said its only a couple of years since a leadership change and all that goes with it
2579348 but i think anyone in the caucus and anyone who has seen us working together can see that its a good working relationship that has been the object of close scrutiny particularly from the caucus and its worked well
2579349 i am not a secret agenda kind of politician never have been never will be
2579350 being in love with a still somewhat dysfunctional married man
2579351 lance felt that kate came on too strong too fast
2579352 she started talking about marriage and babies almost right away
2579353 lance realized he wasnt so committed to the relationship and shouldnt pursue it any more he freaked out at her clinginess and bailed
2579354 what qualifies you do you have a degree in animal husbandry
2579355 tony would let her in and say kristin honey what are you doing here then she would leave and come back and bang on the door again he was trying to do the diplomatic thing and say youre upset you need to go home
2579356 i just thought everyone has issues but the relationship was fine they were cool
2579357 is enough is enough i believe tony was a victim of her behaviour
2579358 he is a really nice guy he is the person that everyone thought he was before this came out
2579359 i never saw him be aggressive towards her he is not a violent person
2579360 she was walking cautiously but she was not in a wheelchair
2579361 i observed a couple in love they would go to clubs and bars they were a normal couple
2579362 two years ago i made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else in 2006 i told elizabeth about the mistake asked her for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness and we have kept this within our family since that time
2579363 john edwards i hit but that lil nicca aint mine
2579364 i would never ever adopt another pet now without going to a shelter to do it i am a changed woman after seeing this show

2579370 happy to have josh return as a member of the hawks
2579371 maintaining the korean studies program is important as it helps international students who will later become opinion leaders in their respective countries better understand korea and play a positive role in promoting koreas image abroad
2579372 culture can only be seen in a clear light when compared with other cultures i believe that is why korean ceramic works have to be judged more in an international setting
2579373 portals and other distributions services impose their own rules and limitations supposedly indie friendly distribution options like steam and instant action still have subjective gatekeepers
2579374 if you want your game to make money you have to consider what will sell and this means adapting your pure creative vision to match the real world
2579375 since we are a small developer that has a hard time getting attention you would think we would have very little piracy

2579377 we are all extremely excited for the future of ohio state volleyball

2579390 low density housing is not just wasteful in terms of land use it also poses other problems such as the size of the local population being insufficient for local shops transport and other services to be financially viable this in turn leads to increased traffic and pollution as people become more dependent on using the car for short local trips
2579391 if we create a culture which seeks happiness not consumption we can avoid environmental damage
2579392 we want dynamic organised communities with a sense of belonging we want a city that will not increase road space in response to traffic jams but rather will further restrict private car use we want a city that clearly devotes more space and resources to children than to motor vehicles
2579393 120 km of main arteries are closed to motor vehicles for a period of seven hours more than 1 5 million people from upper to lower income classes come out to bicycle jog walk and socialise
2579394 the single project that most contributed to improved quality of life was a bus based transit system called transmilenio inspired by the curitiba system in brazil
2579395 we were able to design build the infrastructure create the private partners that would operate it get out the thousands of buses that previously operated there and put the system into operation in three years
2579396 only 66 km the system moves more than 1 million people every day with a public investment of 270 million
2579397 while carse tend to be means of social differentiation bicycles integrate in dutch and danish cites more than 35 percent of the population uses the bicycle for transport while the percentages are insignificant in cities in the developing world the main reason is that developing world cities are designed and built for the wealthier minorities costly elevated highways are built for the benefit of a few while bikewayas and even sidewalks are frequently absent in bogot we built more than 300 kilometers of physically isolated bicycle paths in less than three years from nearly none more than 4 5 percent of the population now use a bicycle for daily transport needs and many more use it sporadically
2579398 alasan kita terus mencari mayat karena menyelesaikan jenazah hukumnya fardhu kifayah kita yakin orang yang mati tenggelam adalah syahid kita tidak mau membiarkan orang mati syahid dibiarkan begitu saja di aceh ini masih banyak mayat dengan kondisi rusak bahkan ada yang dimakan anjing itu tidak bisa kita biarkan maka fpi terus berusaha mencari mayat mayat disini
2579399 saat mengangkat mayat itu kita semua tertegun biasanya mayat mayat yang lain saat diangkat baunya menusuk hidung tapi mayat yang satu ini malah harum saya yakin allah telah menjaga jenazah itu
2579400 apakah mungkin tertolong oleh amalannya yang banyak sehingga mayatnya ringan
2579401 kita semua benar benar terperanjat tapi itulah keagungan dari yang maha kuasa
2579402 they still do not get it tune in to the politicians and you could be f o rgiven for thinking they are finally grasping the significance of climate change sustainable growth is the political clich of our times smart politicians have learnt that there are votes to be had from planting trees listen carefully and the rhetoric is mostly emp ty

2579406 we need nothing less than the equivalent of an all out

2579408 at the moment i am not close to concluding any transfer deal because i am too busy here
2579409 maybe next week something can happen but for now we have to focus on the champions league and forget about transfers because it is a big target for us
2579410 i do not rule anybody completely out at the moment so everything is possible
2579411 i am confident and have belief the team will be focused and treat twente with respect
2579412 we have learned through our experience and i am confident we can qualify

2579416 it is not especially to get premiership experience but to play in the first team every week with that pressure
2579417 then when we feel they are ready to integrate in the first team they come back

2579419 but overall he has all the skill and technical qualities to be an arsenal player

2579421 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2579422 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2579423 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2579424 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2579425 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2579426 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2579427 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2579428 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2579432 escalating the war and providing an excuse for russian counter escalation was a damn stupid thing for saakashvili to do and a remarkably damn stupid thing for him to do absent an extremely compelling cause small weak states living next to abrasive unpredictable great powers need to be extremely careful about what they do in most cases their foreign policy should first and foremost be about avoiding war with the great power this is what saakashvili failed to do the war didnt need to escalate it was a georgian decision to move from the village skirmishes that were happening on tuesday to the siege of tsikhinvali on thursday

2579539 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2579540 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo

2579583 so as i was saying as an intellectual he thrives off his mind reading writing the insatiable need to be with words overwhelming his being
2579584 this intellectualism would be the reason why he thinks he is always right

2579591 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2579592 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2579593 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2579596 that however should not be a reason not to speak and write good english
2579597 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2579598 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2579599 el problema no es que hayamos dejado de creer en dios el problema es que ahora creemos que no se puede creer el problema no es la duda sobre la verdad ni las metodolog as para alcanzarla sino la duda sobre nuestra capacidad para descubrirla
2579600 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2579601 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2579602 about 1 2 million american children now are taking pills for type 2 diabetes sleeping troubles and gastrointestinal problems such as heartburn
2579603 unless we do things to change the way were managing health in this country things will get worse instead of getting better
2579604 body weights are so much higher in children in general and so were going to have larger numbers of adults who develop high blood pressure or abnormal cholesterol or diabetes at an earlier age

2579614 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2579615 still selfish as usual everything had to be about me and that i
2579616 were in a black hole at the moment as far as research goes but it is hard to imagine a world in the future where these technologies are not deployed more widely
2579617 we need to get the evidence to see if these things can be deployed on a wide scale
2579618 the extreme environmentalists are preventing us from collecting the evidence we have to go public and try to move the public debate forward we know what the consequences will be but we need that debate
2579619 we have major concerns we have no idea what the interaction with wild trees could be there could be unforeseen consequences
2579620 there is a growing global movement for a complete moratorium on gm trees because of their ecological impact these trees could cross pollinate with wild trees over great distances if traits are passed on to native trees it can have a significant negative impact on biodiversity
2579621 gm trees are a very bad idea for a lot of reasons if these trees are released into the environment then contamination is inevitable we do not support any trials because there is no guarantee against escapes of the genetically modified traits
2579622 the real tragedy of the attacks on the field trials were that they actually prevented us accumulating the knowledge of just how useful they could be i cant see any justification for interfering with field trials
2579623 the whole area has had such a bad press that it would be a real bonus to find an example where they could show a conservation benefit to make people stop and think again that it could be beneficial rather than the entrenched positions almost knee jerk responses that some of the conservation groups have come out with
2579624 in other parts of the world people really are pursuing it much more actively than we are at the moment if these trees do offer benefits we will be left behind
2579625 we are always open minded and if there were a potentially significant gm breakthrough which for example would allow a reduction in pesticide use or would tackle a challenge thrown up by climate change such as from new pests and diseases then we would consider it within the context of sustainable forest management with partners in the environmental sector and in government

2579639 as i think about where weve come it seems clear that nothing is impossible as long as we know were heading in the right direction for years i have listened to marketers and other people vested in the status quo say that people were unwilling to change their diets that if we wanted them to eat well we would have to sneak nutrients into the foods they already ate fortifying cokes and snack cakes making broccoli taste like candy and otherwise violating innocent vegetables so who would have imagined that people raised among so many choices among the ubiquitous markets bodegas delis restaurants fast food eateries street carts and the like people who can grab and eat anytime anywhere they are in the city would choose to hand over money up front just to get bags that contain at this time of year boiling greens and leeks and parsnips what is going on here today supports and celebrates some of the most exciting and heartening and inspiring activities taking place in the nation in a time when each of us wakes up every morning to new revelations about the coming apart of the world we live in the kinds of communities you are creating around food are genuine sources of hope

2579663 hangman who is he for whom you raise the gallows tree
2579664 hangman have you not done yesterday with the alien one
2579665 did you think id gone to all this fuss to hang one man thats a thing i do to stretch the rope when the rope is new
2579666 have you to do with the gallows bound and he a jew
2579667 is this one he who has served you well and faithfully
2579668 its a clever scheme to try the strength of the gallows beam
2579669 that we hangmen know for easing the trap when the trap springs slow
2579670 there is no one left at all for hanging and so he calls to me to help pull down the gallows tree
2579671 that your scaffold was built for other men and i no henchman of yours
2579672 not i for i answered straight and i told you true the scaffold was raised for none but you for who has served me more faithfully than you with your cowards hope
2579673 and where are the others that might have stood side by your side in the common good
2579674 first the alien then the jew i did no more than you let me do

2579680 if we cant come to an arrangement with tfl they will have to issue a complete set of new cards
2579681 as far as our customers are concerned they should notice no difference before and after transys
2579682 terminating the contract with transys is the first step of the process we have a decent period of time to put new arrangements in place and there will be detail on that in due course
2579683 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2579684 weve seen reports attributed to a georgian minister saying that the russians have bombed the

2579686 at the moment the pipeline is not running at any capacity because there was a fire this week
2579687 we dont want to activate the uk takeover clock because we would risk it running out of time and the offer lapsing while the authorities in south africa were still looking at it
2579688 our advice is that while there can be delays the normal process in south africa is 60 days not that different from the uk takeover timetable they are just trying to scare people into selling up now with the threat the cash might not be on offer later
2579689 that is absolutely not what i want to do but we cant go on like this
2579690 its like doctor zhivago when he returned to find 20 families living in his home
2579691 in new york at least it seems the very top end is a very different market

2579693 connecticut is a wealthy state but a lot of that money depends on what happens on wall street if they are not getting bonuses everything goes into retreat
2579694 people used to move to the suburbs to raise their families now they want to raise them in the city and they want the space to do that comfortably
2579695 when you get north of 20m most of the buyers dont need financing but those buyers who took out jumbo mortgages for 3m 4m 5m they are in trouble
2579696 if job losses rise thats going to affect prices at the top end too because then everyone loses confidence the undertow at the bottom end of the market is unbelievable
2579697 they talk of democracy but they just want their hands on the power
2579698 but we couldnt let dictatorship return under the guise of democracy
2579699 we didnt really like abdallahi but he was democratically elected

2579705 but the priests wife shall not remain in the temple either if my friend is to be treated so unjustly

2579708 bryant conceded that it would be almost impossible very difficult to leave the lakers
2579709 but the most important thing is i played great golf fairways and greens the whole round and that was the most important thing
2579710 i played an excellent round almost perfect i cant believe it i have a chance sunday
2579711 i like it very much the fairways are perfect the greens are hard but they are good with good speed its a good rough you can hit some shots from there
2579712 i like the course and today i could make a very good score even with those conditions
2579713 i couldnt come back after that eight i was almost fighting for the lead in the tournament and suddenly i was trying to make the cut
2579714 it did not stop there kilpatricks interference moved beyond words
2579715 get the expletive off my familys porch and stop harassing my family
2579716 we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2579717 i reflect on my childhood my young adulthood the disappointments of life the problems i brought on myself the self pity i went through before i became a man

2579724 the love of horses knows not its own depth til the hour of separation
2579725 the essential joy of being with horses is that it brings us in contact with the rare elements of grace beauty spirit and freedom
2579726 no heaven can heaven be if my horse isnt there to welcome me
2579727 when i bestride her i soar i am a hawk s he trots the air the earth sings when s he touches it
2579728 to see the winds power the rains cleansing and the suns radiant life one need only to look at the horse
2579729 when your horse follows you without being asked when s he rubs her head on yours and when you look at her and feel a tingle down your spine you know you are loved
2579730 i have seen things so beautiful they have brought tears to my eyes yet none of them can match the gracefulness and beauty of a horse running free
2579731 to many the words love hope and dreams are synonymous with horses
2579732 a true horse wo man does not look at the horse with her eyes s he looks at her horse with her heart
2579733 a stubborn horse walks behind you an impatient horse walks in front of you but a noble companion walks beside you
2579734 a large and liquid eye the swirl of dust around pounding hooves these then are the images that move us
2579735 the air of heaven is that which blows between a horses ears
2579736 to understand the soul of a horse is the closest human beings can come to knowing perfection
2579737 for one to fly one needs only to take the reins
2579738 a good rider can hear her horse speak to him a great rider can hear her horse whisper
2579739 the love for a horse is just as complicated as the love for another human being if you never love a horse you will never understand
2579740 bread may feed my body but my horse feeds my soul
2579741 when you are on a great horse you have the best seat you will ever have
2579742 when a horse greets you with a nicker and regards you with a large and liquid eye the question of where you want to be has been answered
2579743 no philosophers so thoroughly comprehend us as dogs and horses
2579744 at its finest rider and horse are joined not by tack but by trust each is totally reliant upon the other each is the selfless guardian of the others very well being
2579745 i heard a neigh oh such a brisk and melodious neigh it was my very heart leapt with the sound
2579746 through the days of love and celebration and joy and through the dark days of mourning the faithful horse has been with us always
2579747 ask me to show you poetry in motion and i will show you a horse
2579748 there is no secret so close as that between a rider and his horse
2579749 you took me to adventure and to love we two have shared great joy and great sorrow and now i stand at the gate of the paddock watching you run in an ecstasy of freedom knowing you will return to stand quietly loyally beside me
2579750 s he knows when youre happy s he knows when yourre comfortable s he knows when youre confident and s he always knows when you have carrots
2579751 the world is best viewed through the ears of a horse
2579752 no hour of life is wasted that is spent in the saddle
2579753 a man on a horse is spiritually as well as physically bigger then a man on foot
2579754 let a horse whisper in your ear and breathe on your heart you will never regret it
2579755 to ride on a horse is to fly without wings
2579756 there is something about riding down the street on a prancing horse that makes you feel like something even when you aint a thing
2579757 there is something about the outside of a horse that is good for the inside of a man
2579758 on the back of a horse you will find paradise
2579759 in the steady gaze of the horse shines a silent eloquence that speaks of love and loyalty strength and courage it is the window that reveals to us how willing is her spirit how generous her heart
2579760 her hooves pound the beat your heart sings the song
2579761 there are many wonderful places in the world but one of my favorite places is on the back of my horse
2579762 the horse moved like a dancer which is not surprising a horse is a beautiful animal but it is perhaps most remarkable because it moves as if it always hears music
2579763 god forbid that i should go to any heaven where there are no horses
2579764 nothing moves me more then when on the way to fetching in my mare in the morning than the sound of her neighing to me as i open the gate
2579765 when riding a horse we leave our fear troubles and sadness behind on the ground
2579766 dance above ground never descending grace incarnate passion on hooves
2579767 in the trojan horse story man entered and touched the inside of a horse but to see a horse in high spirits is to have the horse enter and touch the inside of a man
2579768 through the days of love and celebration and joy and through the dark days of mourning the faithful horse has been with us always
2579769 labeling a child mentally ill is like hanging a sign around his or her neck saying garbage take it away
2579770 well i should ask them about your questions yeah so
2579771 be strong and of good courage do not fear nor be afraid of them for the lord your god he is the one who goes with you he will not leave you nor forsake you

2579833 too often we fall into the trap of being sentimental and anemic
2579834 is to start acting even in a small way as soon as possible
2579835 its too soon to tell whether our work in dialogue and deliberation is succeeding in creating new realities
2579836 is the work were doing succeeding in creating new and better social realities now
2579837 power properly understood is nothing but the ability to achieve purpose it is the strength required to bring about social political and economic change what is needed is a realization that power without love is reckless and abusive and love without power is sentimental and anemic power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice and justice at its best is power correcting everything that stands against love
2579838 hey hey i know who nichole is and i know that picture too
2579839 there is one thought in my mind one picture only
2579840 possessing supreme or ultimate power to accomplish whatever one pleases
2579841 supreme in power superior in position independent of and unlimited by anyone or anything else
2579842 our god is in heaven he does whatever pleases him
2579843 i know that the lord is great that our lord is greater than all gods the lord does whatever pleases him in the heavens and on the earth in the seas and all their depths
2579844 remember the former things those of long ago i am god and there is no other i am god and there is none like me i make known the end from the beginning from ancient times what is still to come i say my purpose will stand and i will do all that i please
2579845 this day i call heaven and earth as witnesses against you that i have set before you life and death blessings and curses now choose life so that you and your children may live and that you may love the lord your god listen to his voice and hold fast to him for the lord is your life and he will give you many years in the land he swore to give to your fathers abraham isaac and jacob
2579846 but if serving the lord seems undesirable to you then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve whether the gods your forefathers served beyond the river or the gods of the amorites in whose land you are living but as for me and my household we will serve the lord
2579847 who may ascend the hill of the lord who may stand in his holy place he who has clean hands and a pure heart who does not lift up his soul to an idol or swear by what is false he will receive blessing from the lord and vindication from god his savior such is the generation of those who seek him who seek your face o god of jacob
2579848 i am typing these words on a tear stained keyboard

2579851 if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away
2579852 jesus i am resting resting in the joy of what thou art i am finding out the greatness of thy loving heart
2579853 while most of us dont have literal idols sitting in shrines built into our homes we likely do have varying levels of awareness that anything infringing on the supremacy of christ in our lives is indeed an idol

2579868 transformation is one of the hottest topics in christendom but the word does not have a commonly accepted definition
2579869 youth ministry over the past several decades has made tremendous strides churches are hiring many more youth workers and paying them livable salaries we are better educated than ever before we have solid biblical philosophies of youth ministry we are culturally relevant we have an unprecedented amount of books manuals videos web sites and other resources at our disposal yet if we are bluntly honest we must confess what many of us are loathe to admit the emperor has no clothes we are losing ground in the battle for the lives of the emerging generations i really dont know what gods strategy for reaching emerging generations for christ looks like but god certainly does he loves these kids more than we could ever aspire to he stands ready to show us winning strategies we just need to humble ourselves and ask him and listen and then obey
2579870 at this stage in my life i have three sharp arrows in my ministry quiver character matters to god prayer matters to god and unity matters to god
2579871 for while i am passionate about my three arrows i see them simply as ways god has given me to help hit a particular target in my case the target is clear cities its the answer to the thy kingdom come thy will be done part of the lords prayer incarnated by the church of the city within the city
2579872 is a network of servant leaders who have a heart to see gods will and kingdom manifest in the earth our relational fellowship is presence not program driven
2579873 we are living in an amazing day and age since the first transformations video came out in 1999 weve probably gone from about 8 communities that have a sense of transformation which means that at every level of societal life there is a reflection of gods character to about 500 maybe as many as 800
2579874 thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
2579875 to offer your bodies as living sacrifices holy and pleasing to god this is your spiritual act of worship
2579876 it seems as though the lord looked down upon wales and said i am going to show the church and the world what i can do with just a handful of faithful saints who will yield themselves to me the results of that demonstration still send shock waves of conviction and hope to all who hear the story
2579877 when they talk like that i think to myself thats me theyre talking about
2579878 like in a card game at the end we were all in
2579879 when god says he wants us to be set apart for him he is simply telling us to get back to the dream he had when he created the human race he created us to ensure that his kingdom rule power attributes and authority are exercised on earth just as they are in heaven
2579880 the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field when a man found it he hid it again and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls when he found one of great value he went away and sold everything he had and bought it
2579881 set apart for god the call to a surrendered life
2579882 i am convinced that communities are transformed when a few people in them reach a point of yearning for god so desperately that they will pay any price to see his intervention in the land
2579883 today god is looking for individuals who will set themselves apart for him so that he can transform them into vessels for change unfortunately there are many people today who have heard this call from god yet keep playing the procrastination game they are full of excuses based on reasoning that only breeds disobedience my plea to those who understand what i am talking about right now is please dont wait too long one day it will be too late
2579884 enter through the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction and many enter through it but small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only he who does the will of my father who is in heaven
2579885 this is how you should pray our father in heaven hallowed be your name your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven
2579886 give ourselves no rest and give him no rest till he establishes jerusalem or chicago london or singapore and makes her the praise of the earth
2579887 renew the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations
2579888 the name of the city from that time on will be the lord is there
2579889 if we dont see the transforming power of god in our lives we likely have a wrong appetite we hunger for food security control or whatever instead of god we want to see revival as long as we dont have to depart from business as usual from our cherished religious routines but if we really expect god to show up and have his way other things simply have to be set aside jesus compared the kingdom of god to a man who sold everything for a pearl of great price or a treasure hidden in a field was this guy stupid or smart there are two kinds of christians those who are program oriented and predictable and those who really seek the presence of god for their communities in the presence of god everything is possible without his presence all we try to do runs the risk of ending up as dung
2579890 i believe in compulsory cannibalism if people were forced to eat what they killed there would be no more wars
2579891 sudan end sham trials by anti terror courts 30 men sentenced to death after unfair trials
2579892 the special courts set up by sudan to try alleged rebels who attacked khartoum are a charade

2579942 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2579943 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2579944 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2579945 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2579946 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2579947 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2579948 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2579949 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
