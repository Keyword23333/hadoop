4220000 at first i thought it was stupid to bring internet to people who first needed water
4220001 but how do you know people lack water until they can tell you
4220002 at first we did not know how to catch up with our neighbors to the south
4220003 but this technology is shooting us from 20 years behind to 20 years ahead in development
4220004 break the pattern of total dependency on international ngos so prevalent over the past 20 years
4220005 but at least people have the opportunity to be more informed and widen their perspectives
4220006 we can aggregate the local government offices and provide each one with internet this will help in communication with the government in kampala as well as with security
4220007 sometimes when the children are sick they need to go home with bosco we could reach their parents most of whom live in rural areas
4220008 do you know for certain that you are going to be with god in heaven

4220013 i grew up really sort of sheltered so its always exciting for me to break those boundaries and be the one to defy it all
4220014 its exciting to be at the forefront of that leading the atypical contemporary progressive idea of life and living melchior does you know and he also makes mistakes and has to deal with the consequences of them
4220015 its a lot of pressure im filling such large shoes
4220016 but it fuels you a little bit to do your best
4220017 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4220018 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4220019 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4220020 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4220021 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4220022 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4220023 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4220024 no theres a lot of rumors in this business and as im finding out down here theres a lot of rumors that circulate period

4220038 i was more nervous than i have been for a long time coming into this race
4220039 im disappointed with my swim and would love to have made the semi finals and final although in my heart i knew that i wouldnt medal
4220040 i felt awful in the warm up then i did a few sprints and felt amazing but i felt awful again in the race and despite the preparation there was nothing i could do about it
4220041 im not saying ill go for another year another four years i just keep myself in shape enjoy it swimming isnt the be all and end all it always used to be ive enjoyed it a lot more because i didnt put pressure on myself
4220042 land is for sleeping on at night ocean is for daytime
4220043 and was floating for 10 or 15 minutes when i felt like i slammed into something i thought i had drifted into a rock i looked up and saw this huge gray hump then i noticed my leg was bleeding
4220044 then we saw that his calf was not attached to the rest of his leg anymore
4220045 youd think something like that would be more devastatingly painful
4220046 but the sharks teeth are so sharp that it punctures the nerve cauterizes it
4220047 the hospital asked who we were so just so i had full access to aaron i said i was his future fianc e
4220048 its a little late to be asking you this but its all right if i marry your daughter right
4220049 when the shark attack happened we made so many friends in maui its our favorite place on earth
4220050 and its also cathartic and were celebrating a year that aaron isnt dead
4220051 im now convinced that a large segment of the charismatic church will follow the anti christ when he shows up because they have no discernment
4220052 do not lay hands upon anyone too hastily and thereby share responsibility for the sins of others
4220053 this is the inspired answer to the question of verse 35
4220054 that is once we have been justified by faith who is there what power is there that can separate from the love of christ
4220055 again let me put the question can you think of any experience through which a believer might ever go which is neither a thing present nor a thing to come
4220056 it looks to me as though we are safe if we are believers in the lord jesus christ
4220057 such people then may have been very active in what is called christian work they have preached they have cast out demons that is their influence has been such that men and women have found deliverance from satanic power through their ministrations in the name of jesus they have professed with their lips they have accomplished many wonderful works but they are found in that day among the lost and when they plead their great activity and their earnestness in christian testimony the lord says to them
4220058 of these others in spite of all their activity in spite of all their accomplishments he says in the day of judgment
4220059 that is it is possible to do all the things that i have spoken of and yet never be regenerated
4220060 how many of your sins were in the past when christ died on the cross
4220061 that is another question and it would take a whole evening to go into that but here is the point the moment you trust the lord jesus as your saviour your responsibility as a sinner having to do with the god of judgment is ended for eternity but that same moment your responsibility as a child having to do with a father in heaven begins
4220062 if when you were a poor sinner the holy spirit had power sufficient to break down your opposition to god and to bring to an end your unbelief and rebellion do you think for one moment that he does not have power enough to subdue your will as a believer and to carry on to completion the work that he began
4220063 i see you believe in that old baptist doctrine of once in grace always in grace
4220064 i do not know why this should be called either baptist or presbyterian only to the extent that baptists and presbyterians agree with the book and the word of god clearly shows that once god takes us up in grace nothing can separate us from the love of christ so that evidently the expression
4220065 matthew 24 13 and if a man starts out and makes a profession but gives it all up he will never be saved because he was never born again to begin with he was never truly changed by grace divine
4220066 that verse may be rendered like this therefore if any man be in christ this is new creation old things have passed away and all things have become new
4220067 i did not get into the place of spiritual death by any act of my own i was not lost because of any act of my own
4220068 hebrews 7 10 so we every one of us were represented there in adam when the old creation was on trial
4220069 as a result of that failure the old creation fell down in death and every person that has ever been born in the world since that time was born down there no one has been born up here where adam the first started except our lord jesus christ and his birth was a supernatural one
4220070 ephesians 2 6 and because we belong to this new creation we can never be lost
4220071 we are linked with him we belong to the new creation and that is why we shall never be lost
4220072 verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life
4220073 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life
4220074 it is impossible it is unthinkable that one who has eternal life shall ever perish
4220075 here i am a poor lost sinner but the lord in grace picks me up and saves me and i am in his hand
4220076 that is not true it is by faith alone and good works spring from that when you know you have eternal life you will find your heart so filled with love for christ that you will try to live for his glory
4220077 let me say there is no possible scripture that will come to your mind that the present speaker has not considered carefully over and over again
4220078 if you have a clear definite positive scripture do not allow some passage that is perplexing that is difficult to interpret that seems somewhat ambiguous to keep you from believing the positive statement
4220079 it is because i have a salvation like this to offer to men it is because god has sent me to proclaim a salvation like this to sinners that i have confidence in inviting people to come to jesus for i know if they get in living touch with my savior he will make them his forever
4220080 i believed that thoroughly so thoroughly that when people spoke to me about being eternally saved i used to say
4220081 that puzzled me for i never read of anything like it in the bible
4220082 i always make up my mind that i will commit the sin and then get converted again when i come home
4220083 i saw from that how dangerous was the doctrine of being saved today and lost tomorrow
4220084 so four or five of us knelt and prayed very earnestly but he rose again and clenched his fists for he was in great agony and said
4220085 we can quote no scripture on unconditional eternal security because there is none
4220086 when regenerated he is the servant of christ delighting in holiness and indwelt by the spirit of the loving god
4220087 the same grace that saved is the grace that keeps
4220088 but does not hear the voice of the good shepherd and does not follow him that man is a hypocrite he is not a christian
4220089 i pointed out in my former address that in matthew 7 22 23 the lord jesus says
4220090 observe that according to scripture he never says to any soul in the day of judgment
4220091 therefore if one has ever been a sheep of christ the lord jesus knows him
4220092 this shows how little well meaning people distinguish between the life that god gave to adam by creation and the life that he gives to us by regeneration
4220093 i give unto them eternal life and they shall never destroy themselves
4220094 being confident of this very thing that he who hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ
4220095 but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved
4220096 and though his outward life for a brief period was not what it should be his faith remained and jesus restored him and he went on to the end of his life until crucified for his saviour
4220097 from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him
4220098 or between one who is only a disciple and one who is a true believer
4220099 and peter said what every truly converted soul always says
4220100 i sat down and read every one of his books and found that he never mentioned in any of them the blood of christ or christs death on the cross except in one when he spoke of the example of humiliation jesus set by going to the cross
4220101 follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord
4220102 and does not follow peace and holiness will never see the lord
4220103 i started out and soon began to fail and then they said to me
4220104 and it rather bothered me yet they assured me that was the thing and so i went in for it and for six years i struggled for a more thorough treatment of this subject see
4220105 i thought i had to get perfect holiness in this life but what it says there is if you do not follow holiness you will not see the lord
4220106 know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of
4220107 but when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and doth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth shall he live
4220108 do not ever quote ezekiel 18 as though it were gospel it is law
4220109 for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and savior jesus christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog is turned to his own vomit again and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb the sheep is turned to its own vomit again the dog is turned to his own vomit again
4220110 the remarkable thing about this doctrine of the eternal security of the believer is that many of the greatest men of god who have ever lived have believed in it
4220111 for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted of the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame
4220112 if this passage teaches that a man once saved can be lost again then it also teaches that if that man is lost again he can never repent and be saved
4220113 that is you could have all these things and not have salvation
4220114 the entrance of thy words giveth light it giveth understanding unto the simple and have tasted of the heavenly gift
4220115 but the angel saw that ezekiel had only tasted it so he commanded
4220116 it was in his mouth and if his head had been cut off all the truth would be gone but
4220117 they were neither sealed nor indwelt nor baptized nor filled with the spirit
4220118 did you ever see a man in a meeting where the spirit of god was working in power and have you ever gone over and talked to him and said
4220119 and he goes away resisting the spirit although he was a partaker
4220120 he uses this little parable to make clear what he means
4220121 little children it is the last time and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time
4220122 they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us
4220123 he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace
4220124 and as we often put it the great question between god and man today is not primarily the sin question
4220125 but he has met jesus christ or heard of him as the great sin offering he knows that god accepted him and raise him from the dead he has all this knowledge but having it all he is afraid to come out definitely and confess christ as his savior
4220126 does that make you any more fit for heaven than you were the moment you trusted jesus
4220127 it goes for a great deal but it has no saving merit
4220128 and here there are different rewards according to the measure of faithfulness in this life
4220129 i want you to follow me to africa or india
4220130 take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god
4220131 moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain
4220132 i might add others to these but here are three
4220133 you profess to have received the gospel you are saved if you keep in memory what has been preached unto you
4220134 ye therefore beloved seeing ye how these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness
4220135 who concerning the truth have erred saying that the resurrection is past already and overthrow the faith of some
4220136 we see here the possibility of having our faith overthrown thats not what paul is talking about he is speaking of
4220137 but if we were all to lose our salvation every time we drifted into some erroneous thing how serious it would be
4220138 revelation 2 10 how can you say that a man is saved for eternity when the lord says you must be faithful to the end
4220139 1 corinthians 3 15 but i do not want to be saved that way
4220140 if a person has believed to the saving of the soul there is no danger of his
4220141 that does not say that there may not be individuals in the church who are children of god just as in the church at ephesus
4220142 there may be some true christians in that church some of the dear old people who were in it years ago and maybe their membership is still there
4220143 if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear
4220144 in his eighteen years at chicagos moody memorial church his only pastorate every sunday but two had at least one profession of faith in christ

4220175 throwing more subsidies at solar power will mainly serve to increase revenues for producers because they can charge a higher price
4220176 i hate to be fair to the obama campaign but it is remarkable that we have two presidential candidates who are proposing mandatory plans to reduce americas carbon emissions
4220177 the lesson from the european experience is that you dont want to give away permits you should move immediately to a marketdetermined price for carbon
4220178 you should aim for as much predictability and reliability as possible in terms of the number of permits and you should ensure the carbon caps are as comprehensive as possible mccain meets none of these criteria
4220179 setting up a cap and trade system is a strong priority for senator mccain that he is committed to pursuing early into his first term
4220180 he has been committed for many years to achieving this goal
4220181 we are completely opposed to setting up a us system of cap and trade until you have a treaty that includes china and india

4220187 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such case
4220188 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4220189 profound implications for our security relationship going forward not only bilaterally but with nato
4220190 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4220191 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4220192 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4220193 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4220194 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4220195 we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4220196 and so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4220197 our early comments were make sure that the airports are available to us the roads are available to us and the seaports available to us so thats the assessment thats going on during this 48 hours
4220198 were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively that went far beyond just re asserting the autonomy of abkhazia and or their view of the autonomy of abkhazia and south ossetia but to punish georgia
4220199 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the longtime russian sphere of influence
4220200 i have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust i think you make national security policy based on interests and on realities
4220201 the secretary general is extremely concerned by the impact of the recent conflict on the civilian population in georgia which has suffered loss of life and injury significant damage to civilian property and infrastructure as well as sizeable displacement

4220203 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4220204 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4220205 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently

4220321 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4220322 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4220323 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently
4220324 profound implications for our security relationship going forward not only bilaterally but with nato
4220325 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4220326 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4220327 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4220328 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4220329 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4220330 we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4220331 and so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4220332 our early comments were make sure that the airports are available to us the roads are available to us and the seaports available to us so thats the assessment thats going on during this 48 hours
4220333 were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively that went far beyond just re asserting the autonomy of abkhazia and or their view of the autonomy of abkhazia and south ossetia but to punish georgia
4220334 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the longtime russian sphere of influence
4220335 i have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust i think you make national security policy based on interests and on realities
4220336 the secretary general is extremely concerned by the impact of the recent conflict on the civilian population in georgia which has suffered loss of life and injury significant damage to civilian property and infrastructure as well as sizeable displacement
4220337 the critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4220338 to honor this commitment and take immediate measures to allow and facilitate the work of humanitarian actors
4220339 profound implications for our security relationship going forward not only bilaterally but with nato
4220340 we are submitting written evidence and the local action group belvoir locals opposing turbines is putting up a great fight
4220341 this is a miscarriage she was very stressed over the last couple of days this was a result of all that
4220342 till the law remains the same we will look like educated fools those who supported us may not think like this but others do
4220343 i am lonely lonely i was born to be lonely i am best so
4220344 so whaddaya think i say saakashvili is going to restore the territorial integrity of georgia five minutes before the opening ceremony starts in beijing and dare the russians to invade while the games are on
4220345 i said nothing about the possible russian response but if you had asked me i would say that moscow could not have taken it lying down
4220346 certainly the next white house will not be as supportive of saakashvili as this one and so if saakashvili wanted to reunite georgia he really had to do it this year and he was probably hoping the olympic games gave him the right cover
4220347 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
4220348 but most of the audience thought it was being shown live so that was mission accomplished
4220349 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make the ceremonys musical designer chen qigang said
4220350 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
4220351 we used her to sing in all the rehearsals mr chen said
4220352 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
4220353 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all team
4220354 i call for the territorial integrity in georgia to be respected and for the cease fire to be honored
4220355 i think that our system is trying to treat everybody under a particular brand and it doesnt work
4220356 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its needless and its not warranted
4220357 i understand how everybody deserves a second chance and all but im not willing to risk my children and my neighbors to find out if theyre rehabilitated or not
4220358 my evolution in this whole process if its meant to create positive change then great im all for that
4220359 its what i call a tough policy thats not smart
4220360 for i will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sin no more
4220361 no proceedings whether criminal or civil in nuisance and no civil proceedings in respect of the escape of things from land other than proceedings for breach of statutory duty may be brought in relation to development works or operations authorised by an order granting development consent
4220362 what this clause effectively says is that roads airports and power stations are more important than peoples health
4220363 everybody has a right to enjoy their own home without being disturbed by pollution such as noise dust smells or artificial light and councils will do everything they can to make sure this right is upheld
4220364 by exempting major infrastructure projects from nuisance laws the government is tying the hands of councils leaving them unable to respond to the legitimate concerns of local people
4220365 it is totally unacceptable that people should not be able to complain about noise light pollution and general disturbances to their day to day lives
4220366 councils need to be able to hold construction companies to account to ensure that disruption for local people is kept to an absolute minimum
4220367 everyone recognises that the country needs power stations motorways and train tracks but it is vital that councils and local people are properly consulted and that residents know that action will be taken if their lives are unfairly disrupted
4220368 we dont accept these claims the planning bill will ensure that anyone who suffers nuisance will be able to seek compensation
4220369 it is a quicker and more reliable route than the uncertainty of a nuisance claim which can be misused by lawyers trying to block development by simply firing off injunctions causing unnecessary delay to decisions
4220370 i wanted to keep the pain to myself son but now it cuts straight through me do you understand it cuts straight through me
4220371 i found that even 2 500 years ago sophocles was using words like shell shocked and the thousand yard stare those are things that you hear today

4220379 in the next three years the companies will invest 3 billion in oaxaca in the isthmus of tehuantepec wind tunnel in the following way 78 percent will be invested in purchasing wind turbines 14 percent in the electrical system 6 percent in civil work and 2 percent in other spending
4220380 this is actually the second step in the exploration of wind power possibilities
4220381 we have to do a study to see if there is enough wind up there
4220382 if there is we need to figure out how many wind turbines we could put up there
4220383 it is possible to power the city off wind power
4220384 it is a long term process wed have to undergo environmental studies and more feasibility studies this wont be a one or two year project
4220385 we could charge them up to 1 000 a day past the completion date
4220386 they should be done this week or early next week
4220387 i learned fast you cant sell to cowboys they have no money
4220388 you have to appeal to the cowboy in everyone and sell to them
4220389 one of the biggest impressions on me is elvis presley he wore rockmount shirts
4220390 i never wanted to be the richest man in the cemetery
4220391 in our haste to cash in on the obvious environmental benefits of wind power
4220392 we are largely ignoring the ecological damage that turbines can do they could disrupt fragile ecosystems and even contribute to global warming
4220393 its very clear to everybody that we have to move away from conventional fossil fuels
4220394 treat renewable energy as if its a free lunch thats not true you always have to pay a price for any consumption
4220395 at least people will know the location of the sisters once the wind farm is built as when you say you are from there people say where the hell is that
4220396 they certainly add value to my land and the benefits of them providing cheaper clean energy has got to benefit others
4220397 our concerns are with the closeness of the 12 turbines to our property with two of them approximately 250 metres from our home
4220398 if you visit youll have a guilty conscience because this is not puritanical serious business

4220402 i say that as one of the outside of the box areas
4220403 i think the big thing we can help on is research
4220404 here the wind we know weve got a sweet spot here
4220405 ive seen it all before heres what will happen next
4220406 but the architect has been slow where the physiologist has long been eager to invoke the aid of the physical or mathematical sciences and the reasons for this difference lie deep and are partly rooted in old tradition and partly in the diverse minds and temperaments of men to treat the design process as a mechanism was repugnant and seemed even ludicrous to pascal and goethe lover of nature as he was ruled mathematics out of place in natural history even now the architect has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms when he meets with a simple geometrical construction for instance in the honeycomb he would fain refer it to psychical instinct or to skill and ingenuity rather than to the operation of physical forces or mathematical laws

4220745 todays public comments by manchester uniteds manager announcing that he has made an offer for dimitar and is confident that the deal will go through with time working in their favour is a blatant example of sheer arrogance and interference with one of our players

4220764 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such case
4220765 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4220766 media6 creates fully customized audiences for advertisers based on currently available advertiser data
4220767 media6 is revolutionary it is the first company we have seen to tap the potential of social data for advertisers
4220768 the early work with 30 alpha and beta customers since april points to the enormous promise of media6 and the work that joe and the team have undertaken
4220769 u s venture partners has a proven history of early stage investments in winning advertising and media companies such as ask com avenuea and most recently adify they bring to the table a very strong track record of successfully growing small technology companies and building large scale advertising and data systems
4220770 with the addition of joe doran as ceo in april and now u s venture partners as investors we are well positioned to bring our unique audience creation solution to market
4220771 today we take another enormous step forward in our goal of establishing the hudson valley and all of new york as a national and international hub for solar research and development i am especially pleased that solar thin films uses amorphous silicon since it is the most well developed thin film technology to date and has a promising avenue of further development solar thin films is playing a critical role in the steady advancement of solar technology by increasing the efficiency of solar products and lowering their costs i am excited to welcome into the solar energy consortium solar thin films a firm dedicated to making solar technology more mainstream across the county state and country
4220772 tsec is to be complimented in making solar thin films aware of the enormous potential available in ulster county as the company pursues its goal to be a leading provider of amorphous silicon solar modules
4220773 tsec and the ulster county development corporation have assisted solar thin films in finding an appropriate factory site have assisted us in satisfying our financial needs and have been instrumental in forging potential power partnerships with local utilities these steps will be instrumental in protecting the environment reducing our need and utilization of oil and significantly alter the rate of the energy cost spiral we hope to be a major employer in the county and more importantly a very good neighbor
4220774 the 1st quarter net income of 7 297 represents another in a string of profitable quarters for labwire
4220775 we improved margins and absorbed some further overhead restructuring of oti this gives us a good foundation to build on as we anticipate revenue growth to resume in the second half of the year
4220776 we are pleased with our revenue numbers we experienced a 550 000 revenue short fall for the quarter with this business transaction but were able to increase our base business by more than 250 000 allowing labwire to have significant revenue and a profitable quarter to accomplish this and raise our gross margins at the same time is rewarding for management and we are looking forward to more growth and profitability in the second quarter
4220777 the projects we have underway are converting itronics into a viable operating clean technology company with enormous growth potential
4220778 probably the largest challenge we are now facing is to obtain less costly long term debt and equity financing to support our growth we have a five year business plan and a three year funding plan going forward one of managements highest priorities is to implement the companys three year funding plan which includes restructuring its balance sheet
4220779 profound implications for our security relationship going forward not only bilaterally but with nato
4220780 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4220781 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4220782 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4220783 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4220784 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4220785 we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4220786 and so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4220787 our early comments were make sure that the airports are available to us the roads are available to us and the seaports available to us so thats the assessment thats going on during this 48 hours
4220788 were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively that went far beyond just re asserting the autonomy of abkhazia and or their view of the autonomy of abkhazia and south ossetia but to punish georgia
4220789 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the longtime russian sphere of influence
4220790 i have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust i think you make national security policy based on interests and on realities
4220791 the secretary general is extremely concerned by the impact of the recent conflict on the civilian population in georgia which has suffered loss of life and injury significant damage to civilian property and infrastructure as well as sizeable displacement
4220792 the critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4220793 to honor this commitment and take immediate measures to allow and facilitate the work of humanitarian actors
4220794 profound implications for our security relationship going forward not only bilaterally but with nato
4220795 its been a long while since ive had a round with no bogeys i had plenty of them last week thats for sure

4220806 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4220807 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently

4220851 well i think its a combination the guy i really respect on this is dr coburn he believes and i was just reading the thing he wrote that you should do what you can to encourage abstinence where there is going to be sexual activity where that doesnt succeed then he thinks that we should employ contraceptives as well but i agree with him that the first priority is on abstinence i look to people like dr coburn im not very wise on it
4220852 i havent thought about it before i give you an answer let me think about let me think about it a little bit because i never got a question about it before i dont know if i would use taxpayers money for it contraception
4220853 what about grants for sex education in the united states should they include instructions about using contraceptives or should it be bushs policy which is just abstinence
4220854 so no contraception no counseling on contraception just abstinence do you think contraceptives help stop the spread of hiv
4220855 i mean i think youd probably agree it probably does help stop it
4220856 are we on the straight talk express im not informed enough on it let me find out you know im sure ive taken a position on it on the past i have to find out what my position was brian would you find out what my position is on contraception im sure im opposed to government spending on it im sure i support the presidents policies on it
4220857 but you would agree that condoms do stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases would you say no were not going to distribute them knowing that
4220858 get me coburns thing ask weaver to get me coburns paper that he just gave me in the last couple of days ive never gotten into these issues before
4220859 oh my god dude you should have seen the women in that place
4220860 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

4220865 right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4220866 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4220867 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4220868 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4220869 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible

4220871 i just want to thank the staff from soap wire for publishing our press release your website has been a great source of news and resources for us you do a great job supporting natural and organic beauty products your posting has increased our website traffic 10 fold
4220872 we are very happy with the results of our soapwire press release sheer miracle received quite a bit of exposure as a result several magazines and even television producers have contacted us with interest in our product line we got a great product review in vision magazine a number of potential wholesale clients who read our press release have contacted us for information and samples we feel the press release was well worth the investment and are very happy with our roi thanks
4220873 your newswire rocks the last newswire i did on another press site didnt do anything for me yours jumped my site up on google overnight
4220874 having been in the handcrafted industry for over 15 years ive found the soap wire to be not only a dedicated source for valuable and consistent information but also as an advertising tool that landed us an article in the
4220875 now what we have is a roll of hemostatic gauze thats four yards long by three inches wide we want the product to be as intuitive as possible
4220876 were taking advantage of our experience in packaging previous generations of quickclot product we use the machine at about a 300 feet per minute speed
4220877 we use the same pouch for the consumer products but the graphics are more colorful reverse gravure printed in six colors whereas the combat gauze pouch is reverse printed in three colors
4220878 weve developed packages that meet the demands of military use
4220879 they are proven to be rugged easy to open and easy to read and they protect the products over a shelf life of at least three years we also apply six sigma practices to ensure a robust packaging process it made good sense for us to apply this know how to our first responder and consumer products as well given the mission of our products we could do no less
4220880 so you want to write a poem on how beautiful it all is
4220881 no a poem would be sort of inappropriate for this setting you know a poem does not kind of fit in disneyland i was thinking more along the lines of a little opinion piece or maybe something funny you know biting sarcasm about conferences and such like
4220882 academic papers i dont think you provide inspiration for those
4220883 well i could but you have to listen you your professor
4220884 and that insipid balderash citations and references and theory of this that and the other
4220885 yeah even though no one reads it not those guys at the conference they are much too busy trying to explain how wonderful they are and the research they are doing
4220886 not much at least not much in the shape of readable stuff
4220887 what do you take me for mcdonalds readable pieces on demand any way you like them with fries and a large order of coke
4220888 but what there are no buts you want to write you want to be witty and amusing and all that well i am not going to inspire you i dont want to
4220889 well subsection 3 i of section 4678 of the muse job contract says i can quit anytime under these conditions
4220890 now you will tell me you do not know there is a contract
4220891 oh yes to prevent depletion of muse resources inspiration resources we had these designed specially since with the internet and all these people were pouring out their creativity in blogs and such like
4220892 and recognition how can one recognize a muse do i write poetry for you like every one else is doing
4220893 well no you cannot ape the others and think i will be placated but you can put me on a salary
4220894 the same as everyone else gets paid two paychecks a month
4220895 yeah if you keep blowing money buying teeshirts at disneyland you cannot
4220896 i need to know you it says here in subsection 1a of section 3b its within my rights
4220897 yup medical and dental and three holidays a year on christmas new year and shakespeares birthday
4220898 of course i am do you know pragyas muse bought a ferrari she is treated really well
4220899 but i cannot hire you and pay you i can hardly work full time here myself
4220900 frozen river wash over you let its bracing drama and the intensity of its acting restore your spirits as well as your faith in american independent film
4220901 frozen river however is not only the deserved winner of the grand jury prize at sundance it also beautifully illustrates what the movement is supposed to be about
4220902 frozen rivers account of two women who end up unlikely partners smuggling illegal immigrants over the canadian border is very much the vision of writer director courtney hunt who told the story first as a short film before expanding it to feature length
4220903 frozen rivers virtues start with its unusual setting the area around the town of massena in upstate new york just across the st lawrence river from canada and also home to a mohawk reservation that straddles the border with
4220904 frozen river is the way it initially emphasizes how unlikely partners like fire and ice these two exceptionally tough women are
4220905 frozen river asks is how much that communality will mean in the context of an uncaring unforgiving world it is a powerful question and the film answers it in the best way possible

4220907 i do not view the national enquirer as a credible source of news
4220908 the truth of the matter is journalists take tips from all sorts of sources and some of them are unsavory thats not so important as what you do with the tip
4220909 nusrats music invites us to eavesdrop on a man communing with his god ever so eloquently he makes the act of singing a passionate offering to god but we do not merely eavesdrop the deepest part of nusrats magic lies in the fact that he is able to bring our hearts to resonate with the music so deeply that we ourselves become full partners in that offering he sings to god and by listening we also sing to god
4220910 the west will find it difficult there is an even more deeply held belief in western minds that western civilization represents the apex of human civilization and that any alternative would portend a new dark age any people who believe this must also believe they have a moral duty to preserve the supremacy of western civilization

4220950 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4220951 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4220952 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4220953 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4220954 we connected the dots to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
4220955 during the dry season in the amazon the only aerosols of any magnitude are from smoke emerging from human initiated fires
4220956 scientists have observed instances where increases or decreases in the amount of these tiny particles have increased and decreased cloud cover in different places and times
4220957 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
4220958 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
4220959 this improved understanding leads to prediction and prediction can help us plan and perhaps prevent some of the potential consequences of putting aerosols from human activity into the atmosphere
4220960 as wed expected in applying our model increased smoke from the fires created clouds rife with a more pronounced radiative effect rich with human caused aerosols that absorbed sunlight warmed the local atmosphere and blocked evaporation this led to reduced cloud cover over the amazon
4220961 and its encouraging to know the science behind our model should stand no matter the region

4221011 mensen die met een of meer katten in een flat wonen hebben dikwijls te maken met zelfmoordneigingen van de kat
4221012 een kat is een jachtdier als hij op het balkon van een flat loopt dan ziet hij de vogels hoort de honden en de aandrang om te rennen neemt enorm toe net als bij mensen vraagt de kat eerst aandacht voor zijn probleem hij geeft bepaalde signalen een mens slikt net te weinig pillen om te sterven of hij roept alleen maar dat hij er een einde aan maakt een kat zal over de rand van het balkon lopen tegen het hekwerk opspringen of agressief blazen tegen zijn baasje
4221013 uit het rapport blijkt dat wij als dierenartsen niet van het probleem op de hoogte zijn daar kan ik de twee onderzoeksters gelijk in geven wij zijn er niet van op de hoogte omdat het probleem helemaal niet bestaat het is ronduit belachelijk dat katten zelfmoordneigingen hebben
4221014 natuurlijk kennen ze het probleem niet iemand die een kat op de balustrade ziet balanceren gaat niet met zijn of haar kat naar de dierenarts men herkent het su cidale gedrag niet en dus zal ook de dierenarts niet met het probleem geconfronteerd worden
4221015 ik zal geen namen noemen maar als je sommige mensen ontmoet dan begrijp je een zelfmoordpoging van een kat ook wel verhalen over de vele snoepjes voor de kat met de kat naar bed de kat met sokjes fotoalbums vol fotos van de kat het zijn vaak mensen die alleen zijn en geen liefde meer bij de mensen kunnen krijgen ze storten zich dan helemaal op hun kat er zijn zelfs gevallen bekend waar de kat als seksobject werd gebruikt die mensen zijn dus ziek en denken dat ze lief zijn voor hun kat die kat heeft geen vrijheid meer en springt dan bijvoorbeeld uit het raam de kat voelt op zon moment zelf aan in welk leven hij zit als hij nog vier levens te goed heeft dan is de kans groot dat hij springt wellicht wacht hem na de sprong een beter leven

4221024 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4221038 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4221039 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4221040 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4221044 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4221045 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4221046 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4221047 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4221048 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4221049 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4221050 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4221051 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4221052 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4221053 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4221054 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4221055 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4221056 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4221057 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4221058 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education

4221060 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4221061 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4221062 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4221063 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4221064 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4221065 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4221066 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4221067 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today

4221072 a very good one for mercadolibre as our businesses continued to deliver value to our increasing community of users
4221073 clearly the players themselves are going to be out to prove a point and were the first one in their sights
4221074 we expect them to come out firing but that would have been the case anyway
4221075 obviously they are a very dangerous back three fullback jared payne is one of the form players in the first two rounds and we know what fetuu vainikolo can do when given time and space
4221076 inevitably though you dont want to be playing rugby inside your own quarter so there needs to be some kicking for position on the field and well have to make sure our kicks are effective so that we can get a good kick chase in
4221077 weve done some research on them and theyre a good side but we feel there are a couple of areas where we can attack them in and weve been altering our tactics to suit
4221078 dans clearly played with northland before so he brings us some information about them and an understanding about how they play
4221079 hes also very adept at attacking the line and he was the incumbent super 14 five eighth so its only now hes been able to make it back from injury
4221080 i wouldnt have changed anything ive learnt lessons along the way and i just appreciate where i am now and that i have the opportunity to play my blazer game
4221081 it was good to get game time under my belt and feel confident about my knee i was a wee bit nervous running out and i was blowing a bit at the end but ill be better for the run
4221082 theyre in the same boat as us after losing in the first round then winning in the second so we will start on a level slate
4221083 auckland will bring size and will be physical and we know they like to move the ball so we expect a physical and fast game the win over otago was a morale booster and the boys have belief in their ability
4221084 we talked about that this week if we keep believing and keep putting in the hard work then the results will come
4221085 era chiaro che i russi avrebbero reagito male e che labbattimento di queste unit mobili negli ultimi tre mesi era una chiara prova di questo malessere

4221109 right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4221110 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4221111 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4221112 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4221113 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4221114 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
4221115 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him

4221121 they are both committed to winning back the white house and to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver
4221122 they have known since the day she dropped out that she wanted this for history
4221123 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
4221124 i mean everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good because then you know everybody can go ok great
4221125 since the delegate count is so close what if you are called up for nomination and what if you do win by a narrow margin
4221126 that is not going to happen not going to happen look what we want to have happen is for sen obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats
4221127 the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated and that kind of you know there is a catharsis

4221130 ive found that in order to make it through the editorial process my copy should have a certain ruggedness built in
4221131 here we are again if an article is so fragile that it crumbles with a tweak it deserves what it gets
4221132 i believe its a good deal that will expand ultrapar operations
4221133 seven day cycles are common in winter time it takes that long for one weather system to clear as another comes in but unfortunately this one has set in so that it arrives every saturday

4221136 you go through ups and downs but it probably doesnt get any lower than this
4221137 its amazing what things keep popping up this is just another one i think someone has just cursed the club over the last five years i dont think it could get any worse
4221138 but every club goes through some tough times you rebuild
4221139 the bottom line is its up to him he said he had his reasons thats the way things go he went about it his way although i would have never done it that way
4221140 they havent handed any papers to him definitely not i dont know where they stand legally but they the nrl seem to be making a lot of noise because they cant do much more than that
4221141 when something like this happens its not just the the fault of the club or just the fault of the player its normally a bit of both its more complicated than that
4221142 if i was the president of the bulldogs george peponis the first question i would ask myself is why has a player left the club in these conditions
4221143 if sonny bill left us after being disgusted at whats been going on why if hes disgusted about whats been going on perhaps other players are as well
4221144 perhaps he peponis should try and sort out his problems
4221145 obviously the easiest thing for everyone to say is that its about money but that means you can avoid asking yourself the hard questions but it doesnt mean its as easy as that theres a lot more to it than money

4221169 we can confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4221170 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4221171 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale

4221218 there are three truths masquerading as fact among drilling opponents that need to be challenged
4221219 the strongest argument against drilling is that it could distract the country from a pursuit of alternative sources of energy

4221284 i want a refund youre that guy who gets there in the 2nd and leaves in the 6th talks on his cell phone the whole game and tries to get on camera and wave to his buddies when hes on the phone
4221285 we had runners on 1st and 2nd and nobody out with morneau at the plate any sensible manager in the 9th or 10th inning would still bunt morneau or substitute for a player that could bunt
4221286 maybe if i throw out ridiculous statements people will respond to me
4221287 look everyone needs to get over chad bradford you look at his numbers and say man hes a good relivever but he doesnt strike anyone out and relies on ground balls not your prototypical dominant reliever hes as lucky as they come
4221288 if i didnt know anything else id think this team was in last place from all these complaints
4221289 if you dont like it youre not really a fan
4221290 yes but player x gardy did in the past so they are valuable
4221291 they have more than one hole therefore it makes no sense to try to fix any of them
4221292 name one good reason why morneau should not have bunted to move the runner from 2nd to 3rd hmmm doesnt look like you can
4221293 why on earth would you have the big canadian bunt in that situation
4221294 im really curious are the twins more likely to score with men on 1 and 2 and swinging away and no outs or more likely to score with the bases loaded and 1 out
4221295 since june 27 guerrier has made 20 appearances and pitched in 19 total innings during that stretch hes given up 28 hits with an era of 8 53 in his last six outings hes surrendered 14 hits with an era of 22 50 in just 4 innings of work
4221296 they are having a year that no one except true twins fans thought they would have
4221297 what move do you suggest will guarantee the team will be better
4221298 we dont have access you do can ya help us out here and maybe pin him down to an honest answer
4221299 im not a huge everett fan but whats the problem with riding the hot hand
4221300 ill be happy when its retired and everything is measured by single source data
4221301 i think the twins should scrap the entire coaching staff and fire the manager and call up the coaches from rochester the team would certainly have much better results
4221302 managers never win games they can only lose games the players win
4221303 a business should be dynamic it must be flexible and attuned to the changing times it must not stand still or be passive it should continually search for progress and improvements it must regenerate and reinvent itself
4221304 they told me that after the game you know what i dont pay much attention to it its a team thing its great to win 600 games and youre fortunate to have a job and im very proud of that
4221305 this organization has given me an opportunity here and blessed me with a lot of very good baseball players and a great coaching staff and a great bunch of fans so i feel pretty lucky to tell you the truth
4221306 the manuels are not behind him they are non applicable to this ranking
4221307 i think the twins hitting philosphy is what needs to go ortiz is a perfect example play to the strengths of each players not have the player play to your likings in regards to hitting a ball
4221308 gardys pitcher management is of course terrible he leaves starters in way too long when they are doing poorly and takes them out way too soon when they are doing well
4221309 eaa former coach here as well regular season dont mean a thing if you cant take care of the real season
4221310 it took me three years to finally have a good season so now im obviously the prefect fit for the twins apparently
4221311 you forget getting into the playoffs is no more useful than finishing 5th in the central to many posters
4221312 according to this analogy it is the fans complacency that drives the twins mediocrity now that the fans are ever more involved stakeholders i e financing the stadium i hope that their expectations will rise to the level of other teams and that the management will make the necessary changes to please the customers
4221313 rochester has won six of seven overall and 11 of 12 at frontier they trailed in all four games against indy won three of them and knocked off the indians twice in walk off fashion theyre three games under 500 with three weeks to go and i believe they can finish at 500 or better and slip past syracuse two games ahead for third place its an amazing feat considering they lost their top pitcher francisco liriano and top hitter randy ruiz to the twins and pitcher brian duensing to the olympics
4221314 have to admit by the beginning of june i was starting to wonder what the minnesota twins saw in jason pridie when they acquired him from tampa bay as part of the delmon young matt garza trade
4221315 while you are in the wayback machine also enlighten us on the darlings casilla amp span and can you find more than a handful who did not want span released because he was useless garbage
4221316 gardy may or may not be oblivious but he certainly didnt express that to the front office
4221317 gardy may or may not be oblivious but he certainly didnt express that to the front office so somebody certainly is oblivious
4221318 blog consensus its a rebuilding year and the twins have no chance until 2010
4221319 he said no trade was available before the deadline that could help the minnesota twins i believe him
4221320 b 16 nba teams make the play offs 8 mlb teams make playoffs more credit should be given to mlb teams for making playoffs
4221321 an all star line up can be stopped by the worst pitcher a poor line up can pound a cy young pitcher
4221322 from top to bottom they arguably are not the most talented team in their division what more can i say
4221323 this from the guy who was promoting carl pohlad as a philanthropist the other day
4221324 shane i think ruiz was called up when they thought cuddyer was only a few weeks out
4221325 of course dicks the worst well if you actually start eliminating annoucers who are worse than him
4221326 hawk is simply the worst full stop vin scully is the best full stop and i actually think dick and bert are in the upper half of good announcers for a variety of reasons
4221327 and bill smith is either to lazy stupid cheap or stupid to see it incredible
4221328 it just gets so annoying when people whine about how people supposobly whine on this blog isnt that hypocritical enough already t and others
4221329 we get it congrats youve stated your opinion now move the heck on and join the rest of us in talking about baseball
4221330 think of places like pittsburgh which has been in the baseball desert for years without even a whiff of a contending team
4221331 well let you have player x if you give us y
4221332 no body in the blog has said the season is over
4221333 vote for me why accept the lesser of two evils
4221334 well show those evil zionists well give up our chance to compete in the olympics thatll teach em

4221352 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
4221353 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat

4221355 construction costs have risen much more than consumer prices this year due to the extreme run up in petroleum costs the producer price index ppi for inputs to construction rose 10 4 percent from june 2007 to june 2008 versus 5 percent for the consumer price index
4221356 the ppi for highway and street construction the most fuel and asphalt intensive construction segment rose 18 9 percent the national average retail price of on highway diesel fuel on august 4 was 4 50 per gallon up 55 percent in a year and 57 cents more than the average for gasoline
4221357 record gasoline prices are prompting drivers to steer clear of some toll roads bridges and tunnels causing declines in the revenue used for repairs and maintenance
4221358 we decided to consider the area as a whole by putting floating gardens into the water and putting water into the banks
4221359 when you walk along the liffey you are never close to the water which is understandable because of the tide and the boats but the canal is a very quiet place so the idea is to have floating gardens very low in the water
4221360 it had to be some sort of bad dream that these two giants would die on the same weekend and both would be in my movie
4221361 most of our editing is done well go back and see if there is anything we can do better but mac left us with an indelible performance i think i got him at the top of his game
4221362 is eternally positive and thats the way he was in real life the movie gave him an opportunity to be extremely raw and showcase his singing and dancing talent
4221363 his impact on music is immeasurable ive listened to his music my whole life he changed what soul music could be hes the man they both were i want my movie to be a tribute to both of them
4221364 young girls look at magazines and want to see a reflection of themselves and that will tell them that they exist and that they are beautiful
4221365 so we need asians we need black we need latin we need every culture represented in fashion to show that young girl that she matters that she exists and that she is beautiful
4221366 im changing my name because master p is who i used to be
4221367 i wouldnt change my past because its groomed me to be the man i am today
4221368 ive branched out into so many different arenas that range from being the first african american to have a clothing line at wal mart to writing books and speaking on capitol hill but all that gets overshadowed because i come from the hip hop industry therere a lot of people out there who are afraid to grow up and change but im not and p miller is the evolution of me percy miller the entrepreneur the business man

4221372 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4221373 i proved that i played with the best tonight and it couldnt have happened to me on a better stage
4221374 it was one of the goals of the season for me to do well here
4221375 this obviously is a big blow because i expected more
4221376 ive played him on many occasions but i think this was the best ive seen him
4221377 im happy for him hes a good guy i hope he can go all the way now
4221378 i missed some key shots that i probably shouldnt have missed that was that
4221379 not much i could do about it so it was definitely a surprise result for me
4221380 in a lot of the other matches it has been a point here or there
4221381 thats why he was no 1 in the world he played those points better than everyone today i played them well
4221382 it is a most bizarre and painful situation to be living away from my wife and family to not be living in my own home to not be going to work at my own job to not be in the presence of my co workers and community
4221383 to make the necessary applications so that i may return to canada
4221384 its one of those cities i might catch some flak for saying this but you know theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you for example

4221389 the octagon was once a lunatic asylum and is now a luxury condominium
4221390 although that animal testing approach has given us valuable information it is clearly quite expensive and time consuming it uses animals in large numbers and it doesnt always predict which chemicals will be harmful to humans
4221391 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4221392 may the peace that passes all understanding be with you now and evermore
4221393 we are getting closer to knowing the truth behind the absurdly harsh police tactics at the 2004 rnc
4221394 we will pursue this until the full truth behind the nypds political surveillance program is revealed
4221395 were very confident because most of the effort has gone into agreeing the commercial terms within the term sheet so hopefully the next round is not a difficult process to get over the line
4221396 yachting has always been the priority and it just depends on whats happening next with the americas cup
4221397 i feel privileged to be at my second olympics and im thinking no further than that
4221398 i might come back i havent made up my mind
4221399 my experience here olympics is going to have a bearing on it all ill see what i feel like
4221400 the same gentle hands that hold me when im broken they conquered death to bring me victory
4221401 im ecstatic i did not believe i could break the africa record let alone the olympic record
4221402 i will do my best in the semi finals and see how it goes
4221403 david did not qualify for the semi finals of the 50 metres freestyle but he still won his heat and broke the national record which is a great achievement
4221404 there were people doing projects that some other people didnt like and they would play all sorts of jokes on them so that it was impossible to work with them i think the hackers helped progress by undermining professors with stupid plans
4221405 we certainly cant give up now as much as it hurts that we didnt get the points that we wanted
4221406 we certainly didnt think about this tournament for over a year for that result its a bit sore
4221407 every game weve played so far i thought wed earned ourselves a good performance and a good win but obviously not for 70 minutes so its a little bit heart breaking
4221408 im proud of the girls they put an effort out there
4221409 we may have to call someone else in as hard as it may be
4221410 when youre playing germany the expectations of everyone is its going to be a tough game and if we came out with something it would be a big prize versus playing a team that youve targeted to win

4221412 with the boom in laptop computer sales and the recent popularity of cellular telephone pcs and pager technologies many experts are convinced that tomorrows computers will all be mobile this surge in popularity is followed by the desire for continuous internet connectivity regardless of location in other words users desire an internet version of the cellular telephone
4221413 the real story in pc sales is the ascendancy of the notebook computer from 2004 to 2005 desktop pc sales only grew 7 7 percent then stayed flat the next year with less than a percentage point of growth during that same period notebook sales grew 35 8 percent and 28 4 percent in 2007 notebooks are expected to outpace desktops in terms of percentage growth by a factor of almost 5
4221414 the number of laptop computers in use relative to desktops continues to rise and the modern laptop supports both wired and wireless ethernet a lot of us are addicted to staying connected when away from the home or office especially when traveling we seek out places where we can connect to check e mail monitor the status of ongoing projects and take care of various business details when booking hotel accommodations for either business or pleasure a key feature i look for is the availability of high speed internet access in an era where the entire service industry seems to be web based its becoming increasingly inconvenient to be disconnected yet public wireless connectivity isnt pervasive at all and it isnt usually free
4221415 the use of public access hot spots are particularly vulnerable to session hijacking because these locations do not even deploy the rudimentary wired equivalent privacy protocol

4221423 love is patient love is kind it does not envy does not boast it is not proud it is not rude it is not self seeking it is not easily angered it keeps no record of wrongs
4221424 if you have any encouragement from being united with christ if any comfort from his love if any fellowship with the spirit if any tenderness and compassion then make my joy complete by being like minded having the same love being one in spirit and purpose do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit but in humility consider others better than yourselves each of you should look not only to your own interests but also to the interests of others
4221425 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
4221426 you fought the good fight you have finished the race well done you good and faithful servant
4221427 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow
4221428 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a paedophile
4221429 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money
4221430 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4221431 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye

4221455 in essence the bush administration is proposing an nsg rule change that would not only erode rules based efforts to curb the spread of nuclear weapons but it would also allow other states to interpret or ignore the india specific nsg guideline as they see fit
4221456 regarding the current us proposal one of the most notable and troublesome features is the weak and very ambiguous language in section 2 which is ostensibly meant to outline what india has done that qualifies it for a special exemption from nsg guidelines
4221457 us acquiescence to indian demands to delete or modify certain sections
4221458 wow you cant see this kind of crowd anywhere else it helped me and pushed me a lot
4221459 this is a present i give to the beijing olympic games but i have no time to celebrate i have more matches to go
4221460 ive always had a problem with people telling me oh you
4221461 so when everyone was telling me that i had to release my single on itunes because they own the market and thats just what youve gotta do these days i decided that i wasnt going to do it my whole career ive done that whenever everyones headed in the same direction i turn around and run the other way
4221462 this whole thing wasnt some attempt to change the way the industry works or some sh like that it was basically me knowing i had a good song one that people would love when they heard it
4221463 i mean people say itunes is popular because its convenient but so is mcdonalds that dont mean people arent still making reservations to go eat at fancy restaurants too
4221464 i knew the track was solid its got two of the best songs of all time mashed up together warren zevons werewolves of london its got great melodies so really my work was done
4221465 i knew people would hear it and know i wrote it theyd know it was real and thered be that connection and thats whats missing in music today i think people dont believe half the sh they hear some rapper or some pop girl singing about but with me they do and thats why people have reacted the way they have to the song
4221466 i think today everyones worried about looking cool about over thinking everything about all this bullsh
4221467 i just think thats a waste of time and i think a lot of other people do too i just want to have fun enjoy life and have a good time and i think theres a lot of people out there who are just like me
4221468 i keep saying i wasnt trying to reinvent the wheel i just knew i had a great song that flew in the face of everything you hear on the radio or in pop music basically all pop music is now just bad rap songs or like mariah carey or girl pop so this song is really a breath of fresh air
4221469 people wanted to tell me how to release it or that i was making a huge mistake by choosing to ignore itunes and all that but ive always known i can say f you to the best of em and i have done just that many times before and im sure ill do it many times again
4221470 there is absolutely no evidence that she suffered mentally or physically harmed on the plane
4221471 i dont see how anybody could do anything but look into the possibility that this is a potential terrorist attack
4221472 we have no reason to believe it was nobody knows what was in this gentlemans mind
4221473 youd have to ask them why they got involved they may have more expertise with the chemicals
4221474 please ont sic talk sh t that man the christian blogger deserves what happened to him simply because having the bible in one hand and a bread in the other hand is not a correct thing kill them kill them kill them that is my massage sic
4221475 at this point we dont have any nexus to terrorism
4221476 we dont want to hear that word it hurts us it is against our religion
4221477 im not going to speculate its just a death investigation at this point
4221478 we dont even know how much its basically readily available for commercial use
4221479 we were demonstrating peacefully when the police caned us and started firing
4221480 i and another villager hid behind some bushes the pac men dragged us out and assaulted us with sticks till we fainted
4221481 the police initially used water canons then mild lathi charge and teargas shells later they fired in the air to disperse the uncontrollable mob
4221482 whatever the problem whatever the cause whatever the reason there is no place for violence in our society there is no issue that does not lend itself to dialogue and reconciliation the paths of peace and compromise can be complex and difficult but pursue them we must
4221483 india has been the target of terrorist attacks for several decades terrorists with their disruptive agenda will never succeed in discouraging us from our resolve to build a strong india or from working with our neighbours to eliminate this menace from our region
4221484 this is their right and women must strive hard to get their rights malpractices like dowry discrimination against girl child female foeticide domestic violence and drug addiction must be eradicated from our society
4221485 i was always running around and on the bars and thats kind of how i started

4221489 don t want to talk about it it is ridiculous
4221490 you know why abhinav won because he was smart enough to move out of the system he went away trained on his own and was ready
4221491 the indians are good shooters very hard working but think about the system there is the problem of ammunition the shooting ranges are archaic and no one is willing to wait you don t win medals like that
4221492 we are convinced that the government is not serious to find out a solution on the amarnath row
4221493 the problem in jammu and kashmir is not about hindus versus muslims rather its about nationalists versus separatists
4221494 we urge the government to restore the original cabinet order rather than adopt a do nothing policy
4221495 the court orders need to be complied with the mandate of the legislation has to be obeyed
4221496 now determined to assert in order to claim their fair share in the matter of both governance and development
4221497 there is discrimination in the matter of public employment disbursal of funds and development of region
4221498 they people of jammu are told on each occasion if fairness is shown to the people of jammu the psyche of the valley will be hurt
4221499 there is huge sense of hurt and injury in indian public opinion which has resulted in the nationalist opinion being alienated because the separatists have to be pleased
4221500 this is the first time in history that the government has succeeded in even alienating nationalist opinion
4221501 we had estimated an outgo of rs 15 500 crore in 2008 09 that number is being exceeded by a marginal amount the railways had already provided for rs 5 000 crore this year they will incur an additional expenditure of rs 1 400 crore
4221502 it will be a challenge for the government to achieve fiscal and revenue deficit targets in 2008 09

4221507 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4221508 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4221509 i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia
4221510 we are very concerned about these reports it is a serious situation
4221511 if i saw another dog coming id turn and go the other way
4221512 they cannot be serious military coups are not announced they are just staged
4221513 diplomaty is the art of using your superior intellect to prove that your right and everybody else are wrong
4221514 there are millions of individuals living in the u s with diabetes that take injections
4221515 when developing the survey we had two goals in mind the first was to encourage patients to take a more proactive role in communicating with their healthcare team about their concerns regarding insulin injections the second was to dispel the myth that healthcare providers were unaware of or were unwilling to address the quality of life issues surrounding insulin injections it is our hope that the results from this survey accomplish both these goals and that patients and providers will begin talking regularly about these important issues if we can improve the quality of life for 33 percent of people with diabetes who are insulin dependent then we can be one step closer to lessening the impact of the disease on our patients lives
4221516 diabetes is unique in that it requires significant commitment and adherence by the patient to keep it in control if patients are not comfortable communicating issues related to their quality of life over time they may adhere less and less to their regimen putting them increasingly at risk for complications
4221517 as this survey shows a percentage of individuals living with diabetes and taking insulin are altering what they eat during the day to avoid injections or even skipping the injection entirely even if that only happens rarely omission of insulin depending on the circumstance may have an impact on a patients overall health and potentially leave them at risk for serious diabetes related complications
4221518 i am not surprised that many people with diabetes are not talking with the doctors or diabetes educators about their injections
4221519 for years i skipped meals or injections to avoid the hassle and discomfort of taking them but when it came to talking with my doctor about it i did not speak up as much as i could have when i did finally talk to my diabetes educator about my injections i learned there were other less painful ways to manage my diabetes effectively i am so happy i finally said something
4221520 our research efforts have uncovered a number of endocrine effects mediated by bile acids acting on receptors such as fxr and tgr5 this review is one of the first to provide a comprehensive summary of what is now known about bile acid signaling and its relevance for metabolic function from this broad viewpoint we can see the potential for identifying important new therapeutics that can address a number of important disorders
4221521 at intercept we have proprietary insight into the rational design of potent fxr and tgr5 agonists derived from bile acid scaffolds to date we have advanced our lead compound int 747 a first in class fxr agonist into three ongoing phase ii trials the innovative research being reported in the current issue of nature reviews provides additional support for our programs and we look forward to reporting the progress of our discovery and development efforts in the appropriate forums
4221522 we are very pleased with the final results of the double blind clinical trial and are excited to have our first revenue producing molecular diagnostic test ready for commercialization
4221523 the successful development validation and commercialization of this new molecular diagnostic test for prostate cancer proves that hdc by combining our patented svm and svm rfe technology and our expert scientific team has the ability to produce new molecular diagnostic and prognostic tests which are the future of personalized medicine our patent protected discovery method allows us to develop molecular diagnostic and prognostic tests that are free of outside intellectual property rights and thereby allows hdc to fully patent protect our molecular diagnostic gene signatures using the same expertise of our scientific team and the hdc patented technology we are currently developing additional new molecular diagnostic tests in a variety of other cancers some of which we hope will be commercially available in q4 of 2008
4221524 we are pleased to have hdcs new gene based prostate cancer test enter the market like similar molecular diagnostic tests based on unique gene expression profiles such as oncotypedx from genomic health inc nasdaqgm ghdx and mammaprint from agendia
4221525 the excellent results seen in phase i phase ii and phase iii double blinded clinical trials validate the scientific accuracy and robustness of the hdc gene based molecular diagnostic test for prostate cancer
4221526 physicians that are diagnosing and treating prostate cancer patients will be greatly assisted by the additional information that this new prostate cancer test will add to their decision making process
4221527 we are very impressed with the results from these validation studies and i applaud the development teams from both clarient and hdc for their diligent efforts in bringing this new test through the validation phase significantly ahead of schedule the early results from these studies confirm our belief that this powerful genomics based test may provide physicians with useful information to ensure that men with prostate cancer get a more accurate diagnosis sooner and minimize the need for unnecessary biopsies

4221562 despite the steady escalation of gasoline prices since 2002 canadian drivers have so far not cut back on their consumption
4221563 canadians have only marginally altered their driving habits since 2002 and this is reflected in their use of mass transit
4221564 this study raises questions about how fast people are responding to the shift in energy prices
4221565 while gasoline prices have risen significantly the increase would have been almost twice as much without the rise in the canadian dollar
4221566 in the past drivers in canada have shown they can sharply curtail consumption in the face of higher prices
4221567 may reflect the first move by drivers to boost fuel efficiency in response to higher prices

4221581 and i needed to get this over with ill get ready to play tuesday in cleveland
4221582 i guess if need be in an emergency ill catch
4221583 i hope it doesnt happen but if need be ill go back there and do what i can do
4221584 they threw at me and i charged the mound things happen in baseball the thing is the white sox are the team i came up with i have a lot of friends over there i dont have anything against them
4221585 were going to try to stay pat and go with mitch well let him be the fix it guy should we have a need hopefully we wont
4221586 i cant play they threw at me and i reacted i wasnt the first one to do that and i wont be the last one
4221587 and i needed to get this over with ill get ready to play tuesday in cleveland

4221589 i hope it doesnt happen but if need be ill go back there and do what i can do

4221592 i cant play they threw at me and i reacted i wasnt the first one to do that and i wont be the last one
4221593 as far as live catching action its been going on five years for him he looked good receiving and i emphasized it would be in an emergency situation only
4221594 but when i caught the bullpen workout the receiving stuff was fine
4221595 i didnt do any blocking or throwing drills but as far as the receiving part that went fine
4221596 calling a game would probably come from the dugout obviously
4221597 throwing it wont be any worse than it was thats part of the reason im not back there any more
4221598 i think it should be successful i did everything he asked me to do
4221599 as part of the reinstatement review he was given an opportunity to submit any relevant information he would like to provide he was asked to do that by this friday if he chose to do so
4221600 i didnt do them to influence the commissioner i did them to better myself as a person
4221601 they were normally things that i have been doing besides staying out of trouble thats what im trying to do
4221602 commissioner goodell told jones that his continued participation in the nfl depends on demonstrating that he can conduct himself in a lawful and reliable manner
4221603 jones will be expected to continue the personal conduct program established by the nfl and the cowboys and to avoid further adverse involvement with law enforcement
4221604 t o is 10 times faster than brandon marshall and 10 times stronger than brandon marshall
4221605 since he changed his name back to adam hes not even pacman
4221606 hes not even as good as pacman used to be i told him to spice it up a little stop letting me win
4221607 i think it should be successful i did everything he asked me to do
4221608 as part of the reinstatement review he was given an opportunity to submit any relevant information he would like to provide he was asked to do that by this friday if he chose to do so

4221616 when you get all this testosterone going out here it gets a little out of hand
4221617 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
4221618 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4221619 in a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4221620 some people think it could be divisive but i think its going to be healing
4221621 its important to recognize her campaign that she received 18 million votes it will say weve had our say it is now official barack obama is the nominee
4221622 can you believe my husband went riding in that crap
4221623 these discussions between the roman catholic church and the anglican communion have been going on for 42 years
4221624 we would like to bring these down to the local level
4221625 they make it clear that they no longer believe there is truth in the anglican communion and the only way they can find truth is reunion with rome
4221626 several topics of general interest were discussed such as the popular initiative against abortion and the upcoming elections but no agreement or formality was established
4221627 as an organization of lay men that has a strong history and commitment to life we think it is very important to highlight the issues faced by those fathers whose children are aborted
4221628 there are three victims of every abortion the child and both of his or her parents and it is our hope that this conference will be the beginning of a ministry within the church to these fathers who grieve the death of their unborn child in isolation and silence
4221629 30 year history of advocating and acting in support of legalized abortion
4221630 there are many goods you are trying to weigh where you have someone in public life who is not living in their public responsibilities consistent with the catholic faith i think you are concerned about that individual
4221631 one of the things that i said when i met with the governor at one point is that some day shes going to have to stand before god and account for her public service and i hope that shes going to have something better to say than what she does to this point on the protection of the innocent unborn but i said if you go to god and you say well i didnt understand how important this was or i didnt understand that this was such a crucial issue then as your bishop im the one responsible because i didnt do enough to try and make sure of that i told her i wasnt comfortable with that and so i wanted to make sure that she understood what a serious matter this was
4221632 i think you have concern for that individual and in wanting to try to bring about enlightenment and conversion you also have a concern for the rest of your people thats the problem with the individual thats in a public position when they act contradictory to their faith then it can create within the church what the church means by scandal which means leading others into error
4221633 frankly after the pastoral action i did take with the governor
4221634 there were several people who communicated with me that we didnt realize how extreme she was
4221635 i also am concerned about young catholics that are thinking about public service and public life
4221636 they cant go the road of these so called pro choice catholic politicians and really be faithful to your faith
4221637 to my mind you have to pursue it in that way you have to attempt to meet with the individual instruct the individual make sure that youve given them every chance to consider their position before you take extreme action
4221638 to my knowledge she hasnt gone to communion since this second request to her so in that sense from an indirect way shes honoring the request
4221639 she has not communicated with me at this point at all and shes told other people in the media that shes going to respond to me personally but that hasnt happened at this time
4221640 what i found out after i took the pastoral action with governor sebelius is that senator obama had her on his advisory committee for catholics
4221641 but i hope that it alerted senator obama that this is not probably somebody that can really counsel you in terms of the mind and the heart of the church on this very critical and important area
4221642 so i think it would be a bad judgment on senator obamas part to select someone who was in conflict with the church
4221643 we can have a serious impact on the positions that the individuals and parties are taking
4221644 the most important service we can give our brothers and sisters is the clear and humble proclamation of jesus christ who came to this world that we might have life and have it in abundance
4221645 amidst the difficulties of a sometimes hostile environment from the lack of immediate and spectacular results or faced with the insufficiency of human means i invite you not to be overcome by fear weighed down by discouragement or dragged along by inertia
4221646 the present time is a providential occasion for listening again with simplicity purity of heart and fidelity to how christ reminds us that we are not servants but friends
4221647 he instructs us in order that we might remain in his love without molding ourselves to the messages of this world let us not be deaf to his word let us learn from him let us imitate his way of life let us be sowers of the word in this way with all of our lives with the joy of knowing we are loved by jesus who we can call brother we will be valid instruments for him to continue drawing everyone to himself with the mercy that flows from his cross
4221648 to share this treasure with others as there is no greater treasure than to enjoy the friendship of christ and walk by his side consecrating our greatest energies to this beautiful labor is worth it knowing that divine grace precedes sustains and accompanies us in carrying it out
4221649 may you find therefore in persevering prayer in the fervent meditation of the word of god in the obedience to the magisterium of the church in the dignified celebration of the sacraments and in the testimony of fraternal charity the strength necessary to identify with the sentiments of christ you will be his disciples with coherence and generosity proclaiming with your own examples that christ is the son of god the redeemer of man and the firm rock upon which we cement our existence
4221650 the consolation of christ and to offer his love to those in tribulation to those who are weighed down by suffering and have been wounded by the coldness of indifferentism or the scourge of corruption these challenges demand we overcome individualism and isolation and that we strengthen the sense of belonging to the church and the loyal collaboration with her pastors in order to form christian communities that are prayerful unified fraternal and missionary
4221651 a fascinating examination of gods sovereignty and human free will
4221652 what does it mean to submit your physical bodies to gods sovereign care
4221653 for me using hormonal birth control indicates that i dont really trust god with every area of my life
4221654 it is an effort on my part to control something that i really believe god can be trusted with
4221655 shown that we had a lot to learn about nfp and that there is a dark side we werent aware of
4221656 i feel like it really works in harmony with the way that god designed our bodies to work
4221657 in contrast with the pill which works by altering and suppressing our natural systems nfp works by supporting those systems in harmony with their functions it goes with the flow so to speak there is a wisdom and a rightness to that which i really appreciate
4221658 crazy or irresponsible to consider not being on the pill

4221663 its on the front page of the new york times its number one on the new york times best seller list right now i would be very aggressive with reporters and factually going through the book and responding and making it clear that this is a bunch of bullsh t
4221664 in many ways this feels like 2003 all over again
4221665 the same types of things i was doing then im still doing now with the same rewards so i guess i should keep doing it
4221666 what a perfect application of the liberal arts education to be grounded in so many different areas so you can identify names with potential value
4221667 i really enjoyed the challenge of it and the advising part of it
4221668 they were just starting to use computers to plan out what saving certain amounts of money would mean for someone who wanted to create wealth down the road
4221669 the company i joined perkins amp zures had an exclusive roster of medical doctors among their clients and i become the contact person between the doctors accountants and our financial planning product this was right in the middle of a huge upheaval created by the tax reform act of 1986 that changed the rules regarding tax rates and shelters so i went from advising to actually structuring some of these tax shelter products
4221670 we started getting some of our doctors together to actually buy companies not just for the tax benefits but also to profit from the growth of the companies one of the major places we invested was in quickly dawned on us that much more could be delivered on this wire into peoples homes than just the dozen tv channels they were used to getting
4221671 what would happen if you could deliver 40 channels or 100 channels or direct movies and advertisements ill never forget giving a presentation to these doctors telling them that by owning these cable systems around the country you are going to own this wire into peoples homes and you are going to make money on everything that comes in over this wire of course back then who could have known that this would include the amazing power of the internet as well
4221672 i see geodomains as sort of a non exclusive franchise to operate a website for a specific community i think some companies will become very good at doing that and they will want to scale their model by acquiring additional city domains
4221673 we decided to put some money into a partnership to buy into internet companies we analyzed around a thousand different stocks and wound up putting money into both private and public companies
4221674 that was a terrific place to invest in 1999 and 2000 but it became a terrible thing to be doing in 2001 and 2002
4221675 we lived in north san diego which was very expensive but we loved it there so it was a very hard decision to move back to tennessee
4221676 i wanted to be able to stay in business and try to recoup the investments that a lot of people had made with me
4221677 we had originally stumbled into the business after reading a story about
4221678 there was a perception at the time that all of the good domains were taken in com so we thought something like web might be a new opportunity but we discovered most of the good names in that extension which still has not been approved were already reserved by one guy so we thought the ideal thing to do would be to own an extension of our own so we could control all of the good domains
4221679 that got us involved in icanns new tld process and when they started taking applications we applied for kids and at the same started up a registry company called basic fusion that we planned to use to operate the registry
4221680 i found these people selling domain names that i thought would have future value so i felt that as long as i was in for a dime waiting for things to come back with seniors com and a handful of others i might as well be in for a dollar
4221681 i got out the credit cards i had that still had a little room on them and started buying names from people on dnforum
4221682 that started what has now been a five year routine of studying the delete list every day deciding which ones were worth at least 60 to me and entering those with the drop services for others i would wait and hope to pick them up for a registration fee if everyone else passed on them
4221683 i had some dalliances with other extensions and got some one word domains in us and info but have sold most of those off
4221684 there were maybe 15 good domains each day and i knew that ten of them were names that everybody knew about
4221685 so i would try to get the other five that i had identified through hard work my edge was being a professional doing it full time searching every day and not just relying on a computer to filter names but literally looking at the lists myself i was trying to get strong names at the lowest price i could knowing that i couldnt get the best names because i wasnt funded well enough
4221686 originally i just wanted to get associated cities the trade group for developed com city domain owners that stages the annual geodomain expo i wanted to be part of the club to take advantage of the networking and their knowledge of development
4221687 we knew that one of the hardest things to get when domains were at peak values were city domains so we have been going after those while we have this opportunity to get them for awhile a lot of city owners were saying im never going to sell this domain no matter what but there has been some loosening up now we felt that we needed to act because there are only so many cities
4221688 the book has been on hold because there has been such a great fertile environment to go do everything i am telling people in the book to go do and i said why dont i just go do that
4221689 one of the most reliable sources of scathing rebuttal to the left wing media has become known for its humorous but biting style his regular verbal assault on labour ministers has quite a reputation
4221690 we like mr eugenides we highly recommend adding him to your blogroll go and read it is absolutely the most glorious stuff
4221691 oh boy i think reading you and devils kitchen is going to damage my psyche what a joy
4221692 the most amusing non stop critique of the labour government available
4221693 my favorite anglo rage boy the best apoplectic brit blogger
4221694 a widely acknowledged political genius of the first order still he finds time to visit greece sink a pint or two and take on the idiots who purport to govern our fair land
4221695 there really is no purpose to be served by following humbly in the wake of the genius of mr eugenides why seek to improve on perfection when one knows in advance that one will fail
4221696 i am impressed with the dexterity of mr e linguistic and otherwise
4221697 i rather enjoyed the retort of the blogger known as mr eugenides
4221698 ahmad kamu cukup memperhatikan masalah kebaikan walaupun kamu suka berselingkuh dengan wanita lain
4221699 supaya kamu bisa masuk surga coba jawab pertanyaan saya ini apa nama kapal yang terbesar yang pernah dibuat oleh manusia pada masanya tapi kemudian tenggelam karena menabrak gunung es pada pelayaran perdananya
4221700 banu dosamu lebih banyak dari ahmad kamu juga sering mabuk mencuri dan kurang memperhatikan kebaikan pertanyaan untukmu mungkin lebih berat coba jawab berapa korban kapal titanic tersebut

4221707 aphc leaders visit to pakistan will help resolve kashmir issue
4221708 we understand that matters will be settled as a consequence of this visit
4221709 what theres another georgia somewhere else other than the one in the usa
4221710 you probably dont remember that it was touch and go whether greece entered the eu when it did due to it being so backward at the time
4221711 profound implications for our security relationship going forward not only bilaterally but with nato
4221712 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4221713 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4221714 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4221715 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4221716 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4221717 we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4221718 and so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4221719 our early comments were make sure that the airports are available to us the roads are available to us and the seaports available to us so thats the assessment thats going on during this 48 hours
4221720 were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively that went far beyond just re asserting the autonomy of abkhazia and or their view of the autonomy of abkhazia and south ossetia but to punish georgia
4221721 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the longtime russian sphere of influence
4221722 i have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust i think you make national security policy based on interests and on realities
4221723 the secretary general is extremely concerned by the impact of the recent conflict on the civilian population in georgia which has suffered loss of life and injury significant damage to civilian property and infrastructure as well as sizeable displacement
4221724 the critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4221725 to honor this commitment and take immediate measures to allow and facilitate the work of humanitarian actors
4221726 profound implications for our security relationship going forward not only bilaterally but with nato
4221727 promising that turkey will do all it should to complete the construction of the road before 2010
4221728 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4221729 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4221730 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently
4221731 should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4221732 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such case
4221733 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4221734 cette variation du g ne appel tgfbr1 est probablement la cause g n tique la plus courante d couverte ce jour des cancers colorectaux
4221735 nous allons pouvoir identifier un plus grand nombre de personnes pr sentant un risque lev de d velopper ce cancer ce qui permettra probablement de r duire sur le long terme le nombre de cas et de d c s en proc dant des examens fr quents
4221736 il est possible que des tests capables de d tecter ce d faut g n tique fassent partie un jour des examens de routine pour valuer le risque de cancer du colon
4221737 nous devons aussi d terminer la cause mol culaire de cette diff rence pour la corriger et peut tre liminer ce risque
4221738 what theres another georgia somewhere else other than the one in the usa
4221739 you probably dont remember that it was touch and go whether greece entered the eu when it did due to it being so backward at the time
4221740 i think that our system is trying to treat everybody under a particular brand and it doesnt work
4221741 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its needless and its not warranted
4221742 i understand how everybody deserves a second chance and all but im not willing to risk my children and my neighbors to find out if theyre rehabilitated or not
4221743 my evolution in this whole process if its meant to create positive change then great im all for that
4221744 its what i call a tough policy thats not smart
4221745 sei davverio convinta di piacermi meno di quanto io piaccia a te
4221746 si mi vuoi rispondere o s ne sei davvero convinta
4221747 e domani sar pi difficile ora sono assuefatto alla presenza costante del
4221748 a judge can seem to lean one way but rule another if the courts rule in our favor great if not well appeal
4221749 the problem is the judge really didnt understand education funding
4221750 i was very pleased with the way the arguments went yesterday and felt judge cooper had a firm understanding of the issues unfortunately for them opposing counsels arguments fell short
4221751 our 3g chips are for example used in samsung handsets and we are not aware of such problems there
4221752 hey im not going to trip up there and get knocked out
4221753 comes as close to infanticide as anything i have seen in our judiciary
4221754 queremos lograr el forma un hospital inteligente esto es que a trav s de una red interna podramos conocer los procesos que se viven en el interior del hospital y estamos a punto de lograrlo
4221755 ayuda a optimar el recurso que tenemos en los hospitales administrarlo mejor a que sepamos los administrativos del hospitales que condiciones estamos en tiempo y forma ayuda tambi n a optimar de manera muy importante por el ahorro que se provocar
4221756 en 1999 vine por primera vez y cada vez que he vuelto me he encontrado con una ciudad diferente pero esta vez con los juegos especialmente
4221757 en todos los sentidos estamos m s tranquilos ver el accionar del equipo la din mica y la velocidad que se procura adem s ahora pudimos reflejarlo en el marcador
4221758 no ca mos en los mismos errores porque que en las anteriores ocasiones en los ltimos minutos nos hab an quitado la posibilidad que hab amos buscado
4221759 hubo momentos muy interesantes sobre todo en el primer tiempo en el cual el equipo se desenvolvi con mucho control con velocidad teniendo mejor posici n y jugando d nde quer amos jugar
4221760 juntar tres partidos sin triunfo le llamaron crisis estamos conscientes del trabajo que se est haciendo para jugar bien a lo mejor no hab amos tenido la finura del toque pero en este partido se pudo reflejar m s
4221761 i didnt mean to kill nobody i just meant to shoot the sonofabitch in the head him dying was between him and the lord
4221762 you did not choose me but i chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit fruit that will last
4221763 greater love has no one than this that they lay down their lives for their friends you are my friends if you do what i command
4221764 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4221765 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4221766 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
4221767 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
4221768 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
4221769 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
4221770 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
4221771 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
4221772 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
4221773 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
4221774 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
4221775 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
4221776 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
4221777 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
4221778 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
4221779 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
4221780 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
4221781 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
4221782 skyrocketing rent 4 5 amp 8 5 increases okd for city apartments
4221783 wal mart may be the worlds largest retailer and americas number one private employer but it is not above the law
4221784 wal mart has intimidated its workers and attempted to scare them into voting against a particular party and candidate and from what workers tell us these meetings havent stopped this behavior proves that wal mart is willing to go to any lengths to put profits ahead of its workers
4221785 thank you for your passion and your intellect on this question
4221786 it is so necessary to have the voices of girls and women in the formation of our public policy
4221787 nancy pelosi has voted for bushs programs every step of the way
4221788 she talks about how once we get in power well be able to make changes but she hasnt changed a thing
4221789 i dont agree that its a good idea to impeach the president unless we have a real case against him
4221790 you cant impeach a president because you disagree with his policies you have to have some high crimes and misdemeanors
4221791 were not going to split the stock at least not for the present
4221792 the fagan company has served the north central us for almost 100 years
4221793 during all those years we have prided ourselves on providing extraordinary customer service while staying in front of industry changes and trends ddgs commitment to sales and education of digital systems and convergence products provides us a platform for our next century of growth and to better serve our customers
4221794 digital delivery group embodies a vision unlike any other distributor group or purchasing team in the country
4221795 their long range vision and keen understanding of business will give our manufacturers our dealers and us a competitive edge we could not be more excited to be selected as a member of ddg
4221796 papi es ist ninas vater er l sst fragen wann du mit meinen hausaufgaben fertig bist er m chte sie dann abschreiben
4221797 had no idea how his son could have been shot
4221798 lying in pain hardly able to pick up his head but in the last couple days hes been sitting up starting to wag his tail giving kisses today he stood up and took a few steps that was miraculous
4221799 he hasnt tried to bite us once just imagine having shattered bones that kind of pain
4221800 that doesnt lead us to think these injuries were from tumbling out of the car it looks like something else like a beating or some sort of trauma and its strange that both had the same injuries for both to fall in the same way from the car doesnt really match up
4221801 as oakland residents were just infuriated someone would do this to an animal i know it seems weird considering everything that goes on in this town but a lot of people have become cold on the violence in oakland
4221802 if theres enough money put up we can catch these guys if theyre doing this to dogs theyd kill a lot of people too
4221803 i dont think there is a rational explanation for this kind of violence
4221804 i wanted to keep the pain to myself son but now it cuts straight through me do you understand it cuts straight through me
4221805 i found that even 2 500 years ago sophocles was using words like shell shocked and the thousand yard stare those are things that you hear today
4221806 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4221807 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4221808 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue
4221809 we know that greek drama was theater for combat veterans by combat veterans
4221810 a divine madness poisoned his mind tainting his name during the night
4221811 from baghdad with love a marine the war and dog named lava
4221812 the war came home with my husband all four times
4221813 our top message is this talk to your lender right away if you are having a hard time keeping up with your mortgage payments as a result of the disaster
4221814 considering where were at in the global economy i think weve all struggled our pension fund included
4221815 i dont know that the market will ensure success or failure
4221816 a great performance still isnt going to get us out of our problem
4221817 took many years to build and it will take some effort and time to get out of this
4221818 both my husband and i said that if we had our wish we would sell it to david
4221819 its great to see dave and his wife connie running the business the same way that carol and butch ran it
4221820 my husband was one of the best there is in the restaurant business and david is better
4221821 he makes sure that everything goes out of that kitchen the way it is supposed to be
4221822 if something like that happens i dwell on it for a month
4221823 hes polite hes a gentleman and hes a hard worker
4221824 but it made me want to travel around the world
4221825 the camp was one of the most amazing things to see
4221826 not only did boys from the home participate in the camp we also had boys who were homeless join in
4221827 i thought this trip would be a good opportunity for other group members to see what life was like outside the u s
4221828 he really was happy to go and do what he could to help
4221829 theres even trash on the sides of the cliffs falling into the water
4221830 in short the merger has allowed frautschi and rowland to take far more for themselves than that to which they are legally or equitably entitled
4221831 the windfall that the defendants generated for themselves is no accident rather it is the result of a carefully planned and deftly engineered scheme
4221832 la nam est consternada por el informe del presidente que representa un nuevo e inaceptable debilitamiento de las aspiraciones de la ronda de doha adem s el reporte se aleja considerablemente de lo que se hab a negociado hasta julio en ginebra
4221833 en lugar de hacer avanzar la ronda de doha el informe reduce las posibilidades de encontrar una convergencia de puntos de vista
4221834 las propuestas sectoriales en el texto del director general de la omc pascal lamy fueron revisadas unilateralmente en el reporte del presidente del sector industrial el cual reduce la posibilidad de acuerdos sectoriales significativos y por tanto de un resultado equilibrado de las negociaciones
4221835 to gain a greater understanding of them enabling us to work with facts
4221836 aberdeens research confirms that improving capabilities in assessing prioritizing and remediating threats and vulnerabilities pays off in two ways
4221837 first it reduces the costs inflicted by the flood of new threats and vulnerabilities that emerge on a weekly basis second it reduces the total cost of vulnerability management which frees up precious resources to invest in more strategic it initiatives
4221838 my son hes a little bicycle mechanic hes always in the backyard and he dont recall ever seeing nobody over here
4221839 usually ive got a yard full of kids but ive never seen any of those kids come out and play
4221840 they said they had a mother and four kids and apparently theyd been kept at home and there was some abuse allegations and the dad wouldnt let them leave
4221841 just his presence alone was enough for them to comply
4221842 i want you to see this with your own eyes
4221843 if i had been arrested and hadnt done anything my first reaction would be wheres my wife and kids
4221844 the whole thing was going to be determined at this sadc summit
4221845 we were all scheduled to go and meet with the troika the sadc organ on politics and defence
4221846 as everyone is aware for any foreign travel one needs travel documents and mr tsvangirai does not currently have any such documents
4221847 there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
4221848 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
4221849 would be accommodated in the new government when he was ready to sign
4221850 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4221851 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4221852 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently
4221853 christian bale attended a london police station today july 23 on a voluntary basis in order to assist with an allegation that had been made against him to the police by his mother and sister
4221854 mr bale who denies the allegation cooperated throughout gave his account in full of the events in question and has left the station without any charge being made against him by the police at this time there will be no further comment by mr bale
4221855 the u s food and drug administration and other health organizations around the world have concluded that msg is safe
4221856 we have reached a deal with the united states on the shield
4221857 our key demand the presence of patriots has been accepted by the americans
4221858 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4221859 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4221860 should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4221861 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such case
4221862 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale

4221876 the critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4221877 the polarisation of wealth across the age groups and the significant increase in consumer debt levels spurred by a growing divide between house prices and household income levels has resulted in an increase in the number of australian households at risk of mortgage default
4221878 surprisingly despite the marked distribution in wealth to the baby boomers their collective appetite for leveraged finance remains undiminished with those in the 45 59 age group holding over a third of the nations debt
4221879 consequently many younger australians have been crowded out of the property market altogether and many more are now dependent on credit providers
4221880 sinds ik begin jaren tachtig politiek actief werd heb ik me altijd verantwoord voor mijn acties ik heb altijd geweten dat verantwoorden kwetsbaar maakt toch heb ik nooit de keuze gemaakt om mijn mond te houden de wijnand duyvendak uit de jaren tachtig is een andere wijnand dan degene die hier nu zit er zit een belangrijke overgang van soms ook illegale acties naar het be nvloeden van parlementaire besluitvorming via maatschappelijke acties die burgerlijke ongehoorzaamheid zo nodig niet schuwen ik dacht het moet echt anders en koos toen zeer bewust voor de parlementaire weg ondersteund door acties
4221881 we leven in een gemeenschap waarin we onze conflicten op een fatsoenlijke manier proberen te beslechten hier in het parlement moet het verschil gemaakt worden
4221882 dinsdagavond werd ik geconfronteerd met een nieuw gegeven waarvan ik me rot schrok per e mail kreeg ik een open brief waarin een oud topambtenaar van ez me schreef over bedreigingen die hij en zijn gezin hadden gekregen naar aanleiding van publicaties in het blad bluf het nrc publiceerde daarover vandaag tot deze week heb ik daar niets van geweten en ik heb er wellicht ten overvloede ook geen enkele betrokkenheid bij gehad
4221883 zeker gezien dit nieuwe feit word ik in de beeldvorming nog sterker de jaren tachtig ingezogen dat is een beeld waarin ik me niet herken ik ben tot de conclusie gekomen dat ik me beter kan verdedigen als ik mijn functie van kamerlid neerleg dan heb ik mijn handen vrij om me te verzetten tegen een beeld waar ik me ontzettend ongelukkig bij voel
4221884 ik hoop uit de grond van mijn hart dat mijn bijdrage aan de verantwoording ook bij anderen zal leiden tot reflectie en verantwoording
4221885 in mijn boek dat woensdag wordt gepresenteerd concludeer ik dat in de strijd tegen de klimaatverandering twee dingen nodig zijn politici met het lef om de benodigde maatregelen te nemen n mensen die bouwen aan een grote open klimaatbeweging die werkt binnen de grenzen van de wet langs die weg wil ik me de komende jaren keihard blijven inzetten met mijn boek in de hand wil ik graag het debat aangaan en met verve voeren over de wijze waarop we klimaatcrisis moeten bestrijden maatschappelijk en politiek
4221886 ik begrijp dat wijnand in het licht van de gewijzigde omstandigheden tot zijn besluit is gekomen maar ik betreur het ook heel erg
4221887 vorige week heb ik de inbraak uit 1985 hard veroordeeld ik had ook kritiek op de manier waarop hij het naar buiten heeft gebracht wij hebben wijnand toen de ruimte gegeven om te werken aan herstel van zijn geloofwaardigheid ik betreur het heel erg dat hij die ruimte binnen zijn werk als kamerlid nu niet meer ziet
4221888 wijnand is altijd open geweest en heeft zelf informatie aangedragen over zijn activiteiten in het verleden zijn bereidheid tot verantwoording is uitzonderlijk dat mensen zich verantwoorden over het verleden vind ik van groot belang dan moet er echter wel publieke ruimte zijn om te erkennen dat mensen veranderen en zich ontwikkelen en die ruimte heb ik de afgelopen weken weleens gemist
4221889 de fractie van groenlinks de partij en ik zullen wijnand enorm missen als deskundig en betrokken kamerlid een competente en integere collega en een democraat in hart en nieren en een onge venaarde kenner van de mondiale klimaatproblemen en de oplossingen daarvoor
4221890 ik zal hem persoonlijk missen en het is een grote aderlating voor mijn partij
4221891 our checks indicate that demand for the iphone remains very robust and we continue to expect that iphone sales will ramp with improved availability throughout the quarter note that we have seen a major improvement in iphone availability in the us starting 7 28 but we still do not expect supply to completely meet demand until september especially in light of the increased distribution both in the us through best buy and abroad
4221892 we estimate at least 8 3 million iphones could be sold in fiscal 1q09 december with 24 2 million sold in fy09 both estimates look very conservative note that apple expects to be selling the 3g iphone in over 70 countries by the end of calendar 2008 note that upside to iphone sales should boost apples free cash flow we believe shares are very undervalued on this metric
4221893 it does not appear that apple is overly concerned at this time we dont believe this is a material problem at this point and still believe that demand is extremely strong with expanding distribution worldwide

4221902 ive never said that i thought that mitt romneys personal religion ought to have a thing to do with whether he should be elected
4221903 privately though romneys loyalists continue to loathe huckabee at levels that approach the earlier disdain between obama and clinton camps
4221904 you need to get rid of that manager of yours
4221905 the defendant threatened that he would expose a sexual encounter that he claimed mr coughlin had had with two females in philadelphia which in fact did not occur
4221906 and as contained in the affidavit when confronted by the fbi the defendant admitted that he wrote the letters and he made up those allegations

4221924 americas road home represents a very unique partnership for the convention host committee in that most of our sponsors are for profit organizations
4221925 we have tried very diligently to focus this convention on important national issues such as sustainability and energy and americas road home complements that very nicely with their own message of hope for families in need in addition with denver being a leader in homelessness initiatives it is a great way to tie an important message on a national level with a city that has been at the forefront of developing solutions
4221926 there are 600 000 homeless families in the u s representing about 1 5 million children yet the average american has no idea the size of the issue
4221927 our challenge and our goal is to bring awareness to the issue and to compel consumers to give to the cause we think we can accomplish this goal by leveraging the national stage offered to us by the events of the dnc and rnc in order to engage the country and our political leaders in a dialogue about family homelessness in addition we want to be sure that people know there is an issue and that we can provide a way for them to give because the truth is that if we all work together at the 5 and 10 level we can actually put an end to family homelessness in our lifetime

4221956 the iptv opportunity and challenge a service providers entry into consumer television services via iptv represents an enormous market opportunity the potential exists to double the average revenue per unit arpu quickly stop customer loss to competitors and launch a growth trajectory in their revenue stream some service providers consider an iptv play more of a defensive maneuver required to maintain market share and mindshare with consumers who are becoming more and more sophisticated in their communications needs both positions have resulted in a need quickly to mobilize an iptv solution offering industry experts predict rapid expansion in the number of iptv rollouts worldwide over the next decade however the early service providers that have launched iptv have encountered serious operational challenges and the impact is a significant if not fatal delay in achieving their launch acquisition targets the operational challenges emerge as the gating impact to customer acquisition and support this occurs because the service providers operational processes collapse from the unexpected volumes of work hence operational capacity now emerges as the critical success factor from a financial perspective the capital cost of iptv has shown sharp improvements over the past years technology costs have declined significantly due to increased standardization and expanded manufacturing volumes these equipment cost improvements can be expected to continue for some time however the operational costs have remained persistently high for the development and deployment of effective iptv processes this occurs because the cost drivers are not well understood and in most cases remain hidden these poorly understood issues can be costly in terms of efficiency and represent risk to the service providers brand as well as the iptv service itself iptv consulting work and direct participation in multiple market launches has allowed mpi to reach the following observations launching iptv is unlike launching any other service offering in the past the complexity of the service offering the customers established tv viewing expectations and the challenges of maintaining momentum beyond launch are much more difficult than for previous service introductions there is a tendency to assume the primary challenges are technical yet the process based operational challenges are where most failure modes take root and significant cost is incurred the organizational change that must accompany a successful iptv launch and ongoing iptv operations is severely underestimated the complexity of the last mile network infrastructure and cpe configurations reinforces the need for new testing and monitoring capabilities to support the need for reduced truck rolls and improved iptv customer experience mpi is very familiar with the issues associated with planning launching and operating iptv services service provider network operators can manage many of these issues proactively through rigorous planning and execution of comprehensive iptv processes mpi has identified the following three keys to achieving a successful launch 1 using a total team approach across the entire iptv ecosystem from the initial planning stages through to the ongoing operations of iptv after the launch 2 adopting a program management method to achieving a successful launch and then managing operations proactively throughout the life of the service 3 conducting rigorous process design comprehensively testing all processes conducting ongoing process measurement and utilizing a feedback loop for continuous process improvement this guide describes mpis best practices to enable a successful iptv service launch and expedite getting to an acceptable return on investment roi applying the principles of good process design and leveraging implementation experiences as outlined in this document will directly benefit the service providers bottom line and improve their customers experience

4222022 the chosen player has a great deal to do with how you access your music
4222023 please tell me your opinions do all mp3 players sound alike or are there true measurable differences that even the average user can appreciate if a reviewer made a mix tape of high quality music and tested it with the same good headphones on several players would they not notice a difference
4222024 no there are different grades of performance audio quality among portable audio players just as there are with any other kind on audio device they are built using different parts design etc and hence sound different as well
4222025 many players are very similar for example i believe the zune 80 and ipod classic use the same audio circuitry but theyre not all the same the soundstage is much much wider on my zune 80 than it is on my old zen vision m
4222026 i have 5 different players by different brands and they all sound different ive just done a comparison between a sony 818 and a meizu m6 both sound excellent but still have a somewhat different signature sound
4222027 like all audio i find there is a low quality range a mid quality range and a high quality range some level of predominantly sound signature difference across each range and noticeable sq differences between each range and of course the better quality your headphones iems the more youll hear the differences
4222028 ive own the following devices that play mp3 ericsson mp3 handsfree compaq ipaq 3870 motorola e630i sony ericsson k810i sony walkman nwz a816 only the motorola sounded different read crappy the rest there arent significantly different in absolute quality thus imo for the competent ones out there there are very little difference in absolute quality as opposed to sound signature but occasionally youd encounter a crappy one that you could tell right away
4222029 there are differences due to design of the final amp and how it might interact with various phones probably more effect in that latter aspect than anything else sometimes significant but usually not
4222030 im not convinced that i can recognize difference due to hardware however i can tell the differences due to different eq settings now some of these are set as default on players and cant be changed some can
4222031 the players all sound the same quality although some have more volume there is a huge difference in headphones though
4222032 to me i can certainly tell the difference when comparing older players and newer players but if im comparing to newer players like an ipod classic and a zune then there may only be a very subtle difference if any at all in the end it probably comes down to headphones speakers to me i think
4222033 there are players which have hardware and software enhancements of which have obvious differences for example
4222034 there are a few things i look at when considering a music gadget for personal use ok who am i kidding i look at everything but some key points top my list one of them is design i prefer devices that are stylish or unique in some way without sacrificing usability other necessary features include solid sound quality a customizable interface and handy features
4222035 do all mp3 players sound alike or are there true measurable differences that even the average user can appreciate if a reviewer made a mix tape of high quality music and tested it with the same good headphones on several players would they not notice a difference
4222036 thats easy enough no in more detail we test all of our mp3 players at cnet using the same selections of music which is encoded at the same bit rate in the same format we also use the same test pairs of headphones the shure se 310 earbuds and or the ultrasone hfi 700 cans in each case as reviewers we can discern a difference in sound quality among players though in many cases it is minute sure some players sound plain awful while others sound average and still others sound great but distinguishing among the great players or among the average ones is tough or sometimes impossible to do even for an experienced listener most people would not be able to tell the difference in sound quality between say the creative zen and the sony nwz 718f going a bit further its important to note that different manufacturers use different audio chips in their mp3 players even the same vendor apple for instance may use different chips among its product lines as such there is often a measurable difference among players the proof can be seen here
4222037 i am not an audiophile that knows all the terminology and definitive measurements associated with sound but i am a consumer of electronics and have tried out quite a few mp3 players over the years i primarily stick with my ultimate ears super fi 5 pro earphones and i can tell a noticeable difference in audio quality between players while the iphone does a fine job of playing audio i have to say that i have used other devices that sound clearer and louder at the same volume settings than the iphone ipod my ultimate favorite is actually the microsoft zune that blows out all the other devices i have tried after the zune i prefer the nokia n81 8gb and then the iphone it has been some time since i used my sandisk and samsung players but with the zune i really do not see a reason to try others out it is that good
4222038 i was digging around in the registry the other day looking for something unrelated and found some settings for the
4222039 i am astonished by how wonderful this makes my mp3 player sound
4222040 even if you use the very best ipod cable with your stock ipod you are still not avoiding the serious degradation of sound quality that occurs after the internal dac digital audio circuitry
4222041 determining the best sounding player is a tricky task since many of the top devices utilize the same sound chips in fact unless you have the golden ears of an audiophile its difficult to notice the difference between devices
4222042 audio quality starts with the players audio processor dsp and the audio file apples ipod nano famously use a portalplayer chip the shuffle and the samsung utilize a sigmatel chip and cowons iaudio u3 and sandisks c100 series use processors from telechips
4222043 do all mp3 players sound alike or are there true measurable differences that even the average user can appreciate if a reviewer made a mix tape of high quality music and tested it with the same good headphones on several players would they not notice a difference
4222044 i do very much disagree with that bolded statement the differences between players can be night and day however there is a small caveat here where as the night and day difference diminishes as the headphones get cheaper so when you are testing the sound quality of players with stock earbuds you may not be able to tell the difference there are many variables in what makes an mp3 player sound good but one of the core variables is the soc or audio chip this is one of the reasons many moblile phones have poor sound quality they avoid putting a real audio chip on board possibly due to cost power space reasons
4222045 i have refrained from discussing how a particular media player sounds because there are simply far too many variables many of which are completely unrelated to the player itself
4222046 the chosen player has a great deal to do with how you access your music but very little to do with how it sounds sure there are some variables such as a 5 1 channel equalizer and vpt surrounds sound but the truth is the more important factors relate to the format of your music how it was recorded onto your device the quality of your headphones and a whole host of other factors
4222047 the chosen player has a great deal to do with how you access your music but very little to do with how it sounds
4222048 but if you test mp3 players using the same playlist and headphones i believe you will hear differences
4222049 my whole reason why im so mad about it is because democrats need to act like democrats
4222050 democrats work for a living and they have to work and take care of their families and they say these are open to those in the community so they shouldnt ask people to drop everything in their lives for this

4222066 its a little sooner than i wanted i just started training again its a little bit of a short training cycle but i guess im already in pretty good shape
4222067 i wanted to have a little bit more time to chill but also the other fight is a fight ive wanted to fight for a while and i think it will be a big fight so hopefully elitexc will let me give the opportunity to test myself

4222080 en irlanda la gente le tiene un gran respeto al che por su consecuencia de lucha por su relevante papel en la revoluci n cubana porque muri en bolivia manteniendo sus principios y jam s se corrompi especialmente entre los j venes el che es una figura muy respetada cada a o en irlanda se organiza una manifestaci n por la muerte del che el 2007 asistieron 200 j venes lo que para un tema que pudiera parecer tan distante es mucha gente pol ticamente nosotros pensamos que fue un error del che tratar de replicar en bolivia la idea del foco guerrillero y que m s bien hubiera sido preferible e interesante que se hubiera involucrado con las organizaciones de la clase obrera boliviana especialmente con los mineros
4222081 hace 10 a os hab a en irlanda un gran crecimiento eran los primeros tiempos del neoliberalismo en nuestro pa s no obstante ahora existe una gran crisis econ mica el gobierno irland s actual es de derecha y su pol tica neoliberal es muy parecida a la chilena pero creo que ahora las cosas van a cambiar mucho sobre todo en los a os venideros porque las condiciones de los j venes y trabajadores sufrir n importantes modificaciones
4222082 en irlanda tenemos un gran problema porque los dirigentes de los sindicatos tienen acuerdos con el gobierno y con los patrones los dirigentes no quieren luchar contra el neoliberalismo en realidad el partido laborista por ejemplo que en la actualidad se encuentra en la oposici n se ha convertido en un partido capitalista es decir que el pueblo irland s necesita un nuevo partido para los trabajadores pero no es f cil la tarea sin embargo yo creo que es nuestra responsabilidad procurar la creaci n de un nuevo instrumento pol tico con el fin de vehicular la lucha de los j venes y los trabajadores contra el neoliberalismo
4222083 yo fui diputado de la rep blica desde 1997 hasta el 2007 all fui el nico diputado del partido socialista los dem s parlamentarios de los llamados partidos de oposici n no lo eran realmente entonces yo levant una oposici n muy fuerte contra la pol tica neoliberal del gobierno apoyando la lucha de los trabajadores y por eso soy conocido en el pa s
4222084 hace 5 a os ten amos una campa a contra un impuesto por la recolecci n de la basura dom stica que ya estaba pagada por el impuesto global as que era una doble imposici n para nosotros era el primer cap tulo de una serie de impuestos subsiguientes a los servicios p blicos organizamos protestas y manifestaciones hasta que a trav s de una orden judicial se me emplaz a terminar con la agitaci n en torno al impuesto pero nos negamos a terminar las movilizaciones lo que me cost un mes de presidio
4222085 la explotaci n de trabajadores extranjeros en irlanda en un gran problema los inmigrantes provienen de los pa ses del este europeo debido a ello luchamos contra su explotaci n y hace 3 a os hubo un gran esc ndalo al respecto mil trabajadores de turqu a laboraban en el rea de la construcci n en p simas condiciones la explotaci n ocurr a de manera soterrada y conseguimos que 600 obreros votaran la huelga de esta manera con los trabajadores irlandeses y mi situaci n en el parlamento conseguimos 30 millones de euros de la compa a para los trabajadores
4222086 todo ha sido muy dif cil el pr ximo a o hay elecciones municipales y esperamos reunir en la campa a muchas iniciativas y luchas pero todav a no sabemos qu pasar yo pienso volver a participar en las elecciones parlamentarias
4222087 en irlanda el neoliberalismo se expresa a trav s de una mayor explotaci n de los trabajadores sobre los que cae una gran presi n hoy se est atacando el mbito de la pensi n y la extensi n de la jornada laboral de hecho ahora en irlanda mientras vivimos la primera ola de la recesi n los patrones quieren imponer un congelamiento salarial
4222088 la inmensa mayor a de la educaci n escolar y universitaria es de propiedad estatal hay algunos colegios privados pero s lo son para los m s ricos no es nada similar al caso chileno sin embargo hoy el gobierno ya est hablando de recortes de presupuesto para el sector
4222089 en la salud hay muchos problemas no hay recursos suficientes y el gobierno pretende privatizar sectores del servicio a trav s de contratos a empresas norteamericanas que est n construyendo nuevos hospitales
4222090 en el tema previsional los trabajadores del estado tienen pensiones p blicas y los trabajadores privados tienen pensiones privadas de todos modos al cumplir 66 a os de edad todos los trabajadores reciben una pensi n fiscal no es muy grande pero si la gente mayor no tiene que pagar alquiler o hipotecas alcanza para vivir en todo caso es muy caro vivir en irlanda los precios son muy altos comprar una casa para los j venes es casi imposible en los 10 ltimos a os las casas para los trabajadores han aumentado su precio 4 veces los padres de los j venes irlandeses de la actualidad ten an hipotecas por 20 a os ahora la duraci n de las hipotecas para los j venes llega a los 40 a os debido a la especulaci n auspiciada por el gobierno
4222091 es obvio advertir en chile que la vida es muy dif cil para mucha gente
4222092 s es posible el socialismo en irlanda hoy se est n viviendo grandes cambios mundiales debido a la crisis de origen norteamericano los trabajadores y los j venes est n pensando seriamente en la nueva situaci n econ mica y creo que en este sentido la conciencia va a cambiar es decir que habr mejores oportunidades para los socialistas para construir un nuevo movimiento lo mismo pienso que ocurrir en otros pa ses de europa

4222136 there are two words i dont allow in my class one is gross and the other is cool
4222137 bumblebees are a critical pollinator of a lot of the fruits and vegetables we eat every day
4222138 they are linked to a lot of crops we depend on without the bees we would require manual pollination but it wouldnt take long before wed have to completely take some of the crops out of our diet
4222139 the disease spillover from domesticated bumblebees contributes to the decline of the wild bumblebee population but we are not suggesting it is the only factor at play
4222140 whether one is a predominant factor is too early to say
4222141 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4222142 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4222143 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4222144 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4222145 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4222146 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries
4222147 now many of their estuaries and coastal seas are suffering the same malady
4222148 weve found that in all the tests they do tend to favor particular limbs which tends to give them a legs and arms sort of layout
4222149 their front two tentacles will be used for a lot of exploratory work and then the ones immediately behind them will then be used also if further investigation is needed
4222150 then the further back you go the more the limbs are used for propulsion and movement
4222151 from what weve seen all the limbs basically have the same capabilities but they seem to favor this system and it works well for them
4222152 with live prey it does help them when sneaking up with the front limbs ready to pounce and using the back ones for propulsion
4222153 they have that facility unlike humans where if we tried to grab our food with our feet we might fail miserably
4222154 the names pretty good and they would have to rename james bond movies

4222178 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4222179 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4222252 torpedo kicks ass smart and involving with an action through line that shoots ahead like its namesake fast and lethal i read it in one sitting
4222253 torpedo scares the pants off the reader one scene scarcely ends before the author throws another that is even more riveting at the reader even more worrisome is the fact that everything in jeff edwards book can actually happen the authors descriptions are vivid and believable making the book a real page turner
4222254 awash with excitement torpedo by jeff edwards is the sort of debut novel that holds one attention from first word to last the characters are rich and complex the plot is not only full of surprises but also is delivered with an unerring eye for detail the dialog crackles and the prose is often lyrical

4222269 is the absence or utter lack of consultation of stakeholders including christian leaders indigenous peoples in mindanao and peace advocates themselves
4222270 contravenes the very essence of any peace process which is participative of the stakeholders
4222271 as painful as it is we have a responsibility to keep our commitment to the international community promote international peace and cooperation and advance the cause of african brotherhood and good neighborliness
4222272 one person died of bullet injuries while another was injured

4222275 the agreement is designed to provide rapid recovery of fair compensation for american nationals with terrorism related claims against libya
4222276 it will also address libyan claims arising from previous u s military actions the agreement is being pursued on a purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party
4222277 they allow this horrible terrorist who murdered my daughter and all these other people to triumph this is a triumph for terrorism
4222278 all this does it says we swept the families away we pretend that gadhafi never blew up an american plane
4222279 we went through a long path of negotiations until we reached this agreement
4222280 it opens new horizons for relations based on mutual respect the agreement turns the page on the negative past forever
4222281 we believe that dialogue is the best way to resolve the issue and we are always ready for dialogue
4222282 those who do not respect that will lose themselves there will be no change in the will of the iranian people
4222283 the talks in geneva were positive and we believe that a positive direction was found
4222284 we believe it will be reasonable to discuss the common issues in those packages and reach a compromise this could pave the way for resolving the disputed issues
4222285 we expect the negotiation process to continue with the good will of all parties and reach a positive outcome in a short time
4222286 when people see that border guards are less vigilant or simply not there they would be migrants take advantage of the more open coastline to flee
4222287 i know when people have left to try and make it to europe by sea because i will not see them at church for one to two weeks since the coup less are coming to services
4222288 anytime you have changes in maritime surveillance there will be changes in migration patterns we expect the numbers who are repatriated to mauritania to increase
4222289 there is a presidential decree and it will naturally be implemented
4222290 i guarantee that we will do everything to ensure the presidents decree is carried out
4222291 there wont be anything even close to normality with gazas border crossings
4222292 there is a growing frustration among the population because they cannot feel the dividend of the truce on their daily life
4222293 we expected the crossings would be open the siege would be lifted and we would have a life and none of that happened
4222294 we chose closings as a nonviolent response to the violations of the quiet
4222295 its going to make it more difficult for the eu to have a russia policy the war if anything has divided the european unions member states
4222296 this has ended medvedevs honeymoon with the west its clear that putin not medvedev is in charge we had hoped for a new start now we have a new start but of a different kind
4222297 it is clear that the russian military action is bound to have consequences for eu russia relations
4222298 the implications on russia are almost invisible it wont make russia any less attractive
4222299 i suspect that the divisions in nato will have deepened in fact each side will probably feel justified in taking the position in bucharest that it did

4222330 with current fuel prices at all time highs i cannot support any increase in motor fuel taxes and ask that the task force look to other approaches
4222331 the state will be best served if the task force reviews a range of transportation investment scenarios and considers approaches that could be implemented in stages if necessary

4222350 du har skapat n got nytt n got som verkligen beh vdes
4222351 say la iiaha illallah there is no god but allah la iiaha illallah
4222352 has not the time arrived for the believers that their hearts in all humility should engage in the remembrance of allah and of the truth which has been revealed to them and that they should not become like those to whom was given revelation aforetime but long ages passed over them and their hearts grew hard for many among them are rebellious transgressors
4222353 my husband alqamah is on his deathbed i therefore came to tell you messenger of allah about his condition
4222354 messenger of allah his mother is but she is very old
4222355 may my life be a ransom for him it is my pleasure to go to him
4222356 umm alqamah tell me the truth for otherwise allah most high will reveal the truth to me what is the situation concerning your son alqamah
4222357 messenger of allah he prays much fasts a great deal and spends a great amount in charity
4222358 messenger of allah he has preferred his wife to me and has disobeyed me
4222359 umm alqamah surely your anger has prevented alqamahs tongue from pronouncing the shahadah
4222360 messenger of allah he is my son my heart cannot bear your burning him in front of me
4222361 umm alqamah allahs punishment is more severe and more lasting
4222362 messenger of allah i call upon allah most high and his angels and the muslims who are present to be my witnesses that i am pleased with my son alqamah
4222363 bilal go to him and see whether he is now able to say
4222364 it is surely true that while alqamahs mother was angry with him his tongue was tied and now that she is pleased with him his tongue is freed
4222365 you company of muhajireen and helpers if anyone favors his wife over his mother allah and his angels and all the people curse him allah does not accept his spending in charity and his uprightness unless he repents toward allah the glorious and majestic and reconciles with her and attains her pleasure because allahs pleasure consists in her pleasure and allahs anger consists in her anger
4222366 my body was dragged over heaps of burning coal and the blood and fat coming out of my back put out the fire
4222367 allah subhanahu wa taala seems to be compensating us in this world for all our sufferings and perhaps nothing would be left for us as reward in the akhirah
4222368 she addressed the prophet and said i have woven it with my hands for you to wear the prophet took it as he was in need of it and came to us wearing it as a waist sheet one of us said o allahs apostle give it to me to wear the prophet agreed to give it to him the prophet sat with the people for a while and then returned home wrapped that waist sheet and sent it to him the people said to that man you havent done well by asking him for it when you know that he never turns down anybodys request the man replied by allah i have not asked him for it except to use it as my shroud when i die

4222370 this is an extension of a technology thats been around in the server world for several years
4222371 on servers you have something thats called a service processor thats always awake and can do things like monitor the system do reboots and run diagnostics youd have complete remote access to your home pc you could do that now but the computer has to be turned on all the time and sleep mode can interfere with remote operations
4222372 this technological collaboration enables users to reduce wasted energy while still being able to conveniently access all their files even when on the go
4222373 think of when you can for instance tell your home computer to boot up email you a file at work and then turn itself off with this someday you could turn your computer on remotely turn it off remotely reboot it anything you like you also could schedule things to happen unattended
4222374 from the perspective of lowering gas prices they dont really matter even the most optimistic estimates about offshore drilling the exact ones pushed by its strongest proponents promise no relief at the pump now and only a small impact later

4222402 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its needless and its not warranted
4222403 i understand how everybody deserves a second chance and all but im not willing to risk my children and my neighbors to find out if theyre rehabilitated or not
4222404 my evolution in this whole process if its meant to create positive change then great im all for that

4222426 i found that even 2 500 years ago sophocles was using words like shell shocked and the thousand yard stare those are things that you hear today
4222427 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4222428 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4222429 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue
4222430 we know that greek drama was theater for combat veterans by combat veterans

4222446 what a way to start the new year with two of the storied names in hockey playing in one of americas venerable stadiums
4222447 the winter classic has become a great addition to what already was an appointment viewing date on the sports calendar
4222448 this original six city provides us with the ideal stage to showcase some of the nhls brightest stars
4222449 guys just want rail thin skinny girls and not a real woman
4222450 im sorry i gave you my number im just not interested
4222451 we are a party of local control and the senate district 16 republicans have endorsed mark olson and we respect that decision
4222452 is their one particular nfl statistic that you would class as indispensable when working against the point spread
4222453 why not let the poor thing live out its homely life in peace
4222454 yes you do actually need to put your mouth on it to be successful
4222455 pat is a polished pitcher who continues to increase his velocity and improve his command he is a great addition to our staff
4222456 greg is a big physical guy who throws three pitches for strikes he has played for an excellent high school and summer program and because of his size i believe he has a tremendous upside
4222457 eric came to camp and really just dominated he has excellent movement a good breaking ball and has added a change up that will help him with left handed hitters he should get innings right away
4222458 we figured ryan lavarnway drafted in the sixth round of the 2008 draft was going to leave and we needed to get a catcher ryan brenner was the guy we wanted the most and were lucky enough to get him we knew he was a good defensive catcher but he has had a tremendous spring and summer with the bat
4222459 zach brings energy to everything he does he comes from a very successful high school program he runs well is a tough out and can play just about anywhere he is a great addition
4222460 matt is just excellent defensively he can make all the plays and is also a tough out he can run and seems to be a good candidate to eventually hit in the one or two hole he has a good aptitude for the game
4222461 charlie is a superb athlete the biggest question i am going to have is where to play him his bat is a huge addition and the fact that he is so versatile defensively will really strengthen our team
4222462 id like to see a user in it hopefully not another speculator
4222463 ideally its built for one tenant but it can accommodate multiple tenants
4222464 supports historical decision of the georgian government and people to leave cis we support georgias political development and true value of human rights and freedoms
4222465 cis is a club of authoritarian leaders situation in the caucasus manifests that russia is not going to give up its imperial habits this is why for such small countries like georgia or kyrgyzstan it is crucial to stand up for their own independence and strive for human rights
4222466 basically could not do anything to prevent this tragedy from happening
4222467 how can the countries in the alliance to act so irresponsibly towards another cis member
4222468 on the opposite the union will get stronger it is clear that nowadays it is very hard to survive on your own countries have to cooperate
4222469 these recommendations make it clear to the people of kentucky just how serious we are in ensuring the safety and welfare of our racing horses
4222470 this action would also go a long way in leveling the field for our bettors through this most up to date and scientifically based rule for banning anabolic steroid use in horses who are racing in the country
4222471 we want to see more balance where everyone has a good chance of winning rather than just being an also ran
4222472 trying to get any sport into where its not known at all where theres no interest isnt easy
4222473 its easy when you to go a country and say hey were an olympic sport right away you get instant credibility
4222474 the problem we face now is that were not an olympic sport but we want to be again
4222475 if we can get kids interested at a young age we have a better opportunity to see our sport develop
4222476 a lot of people dont understand now to play it
4222477 we need to get more kids involved in the sport our numbers have definitely dropped
4222478 kids are just not playing as many sports as they used to
4222479 outside of the united states its very difficult anywhere you go but thats kind of part of growing the sport
4222480 were playing the game the way we want to play it
4222481 its going to be great no matter how we do out there because well be together
4222482 andrews interest and his skills kind of just blossomed overnight
4222483 i cant tell you how proud of him i really am
4222484 its engine had seized so we basically got the car for the price of the four tires that were on it
4222485 from what weve been told only 11 other people have ever been able to drive a car to bonneville and go fast enough to qualify for the long course
4222486 if i could become the 12th person to do that it would really be fantastic but we have no idea what will happen until we get out there
4222487 but either way he and i are just going to have fun together
4222488 we dont try to send messages we just play basketball
4222489 it was chris bosh i thought he was phenomenal he got so many deflections he got a lot of blocked shots scored a lot of points and he got a lot of rebounds he was a presence out there
4222490 nobody could believe this the greek team made the americans kneel to them
4222491 it really means a lot to us we wanted to keep the pressure on them we wanted to kind of redeem ourselves this was like a payback game for us
4222492 we knew that people were wondering how we would respond we just went out there and tried to play a solid game and stay on them the whole time
4222493 this stupid american with his big hairy body has clogged the drains and well all soon be washed into the yangtse river

4222495 the grand challenge is one of a number of mod initiatives to develop new defense technologies the uk has a world class track record in scientific excellence and we want to draw on all of the expertise that is out there from box room inventors just starting out to the largest defense firms
4222496 the competition has been designed to provide an accessible and fun event for participants but there is a very serious point to it that is that the threats faced by our armed forces are continually evolving and exploiting the latest technologies will help them stay safe and ahead of the opposition
4222497 the positive point is that the call to all the armed groups to release child soldiers has been heard by some of them

4222501 i think there is a distinct possibility of one of the messages coming out of this gathering and this new baptist covenant is creation care that we who are baptists of like mind in attempting to glorify god are not going to countenance the contempt on gods creation
4222502 each of us here today is unity by an even greater bond our faith here today we celebrate unity in jesus christ our faith can help bridge differences as baptists were committed to promoting equality peace and justice in the world the new baptist covenant offers a chance for us to bear witness for jesus christs love for all
4222503 any minister ought to be able to do anything that jesse jackson can do
4222504 friends that is no small accomplishment we do have some diversity
4222505 part of discovery is finding things that you least expect
4222506 when you come across something like that in the middle of the desert it sends a tingle down your spine
4222507 everywhere you turned there were bones belonging to animals that dont live in the desert
4222508 at first glance its hard to imagine two more biologically distinct groups of people burying their dead in the same place
4222509 which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active strenuous lifestyle the kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition
4222510 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies
4222511 were losing this generation of young people because weve made christianity too easy for them
4222512 rise up you suckers and go out and do the work of jesus
4222513 we do not have a money problem we have a priority and values problem
4222514 after generations of cleaning up wrongs between us after generations of separation after generations of division divisions by geography divisions by theology but most of all divisions by race a new day has dawned today in this place from the north and the south from canada from mexico from throughout the united states and around the world baptists who are black and baptists who are white baptists who are brown baptists who are conservative baptists who are moderate baptists who are progressive today we all sit down together at the table of christian brother and sisterhood by coming together here in atlanta we acknowledge that the things that have divided us should not and these thigs must not obscure what we share in common and that is our commitment to follow jesus christ as our lord and savior today we celebrate a new day we celebrate a new baptist covenant a covenant that we will united together to create an authentic and genuine baptist voice in these troubled times a covenant that we will unite in our commitment to traditional baptist values including sharing the gospel of jesus christ and its implications for public and private morality we will unite and honor the commandment of our lord and savior that we will love our neighbor as god has loved us
4222515 joy to stand up in front of you as a baptist
4222516 never before have baptists sought to explore possibilities of cooperation for missions and ministries something that has never happened before were glad youre here
4222517 religious leaders who suppress conscience and the soul as though they are not aware that you god are lord of the soul
4222518 there was a 6 year old child who was subjected to the sort of obscenities you wouldnt want a 6 year old to hear
4222519 theres a salacious smutty side to this case but its not about sex its about allowing your neighbors to have a normal decent life without being disturbed
4222520 what jesus was about was not just bringing relief to the poor not just shades to the blind but sight to the blind and each of the instances that he concretizes his mission he expresses the work of reversal not relief even the issue of justice is tied up to jesus definition of his ministry because if you read in isaiah where he read from the book he says because i love justice and i hate inequity so that justice itself is ooted in the raelity of the incarnation and is rooted in the reality of creation for when god made mankind he made us male and female in his image
4222521 to do injustice to anybody is to do injustice to the reality of god because we are in his image and his image is not to be demeaned you really cant embrace the mission of jesus and not be confronted with the reality of the claims of justice and that reality is deeply challenging because when jesus came he came not with actions of charity he came to change
4222522 one of the tragedies of injustice is that it dims peoples idea and visions of whats possible
4222523 peace is not just the absence of disturbance calm without justice is an allusion to peace it is disguised oppression one looks at kenya now one sees the breakout of warfare there and the warfare was not stimulated just by contested election results but grew out of inequities between the tribes and perpetrated in the democratic governmantal set up in the country it might have looked like kenya was at peace but what they had was a simmering volcano because justice had not been done one looks in the middle east and we look for calm there but calmness will not come and will not mean justice until justice is done for those who have been displaced and for those whose lives are threatened now because of the imbalance now
4222524 if it is right that children who are conceived should be brought to birth and it is then it is also right that children born should have the right to life and if there is no right to life and if there is no right to live and the right to be born becomes a tool of injustice
4222525 because god loved us enough that he didnt stay in heaven waiting for us to get to him hecame to earth and subjected himself to the thigns of which he is exposed
4222526 baptists are people of the book and we are people who can read the word for itself and then there is nobody who can correct my individual belief because we are directly tied to god ourselves
4222527 what if a woman chooses to have children and stay home to raise them
4222528 professor good student who had no intention of attending at least a year in europe in finishing school after college bad

4222535 we started when prince albert was one of the fattest cities in canada we are trying to change from the fattest to the fittest
4222536 it is neat to see what you accomplish this year and work towards for next year
4222537 if tomorrow mr saakashvili signs the document that we have negotiated with russian president mr medvedev then the withdrawal of russian troops can begin
4222538 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4222539 this is going to be a defining crisis in the united states russian relationship the danger is that neither side feels it can back down
4222540 we may only be at the beginning of this crisis rather than at the end of it
4222541 i have heard some threats that they will not accept us into the wto but no one has so far even tried to allow us to join it
4222542 you defended your land and justice was on your side
4222543 that is why you won with the assistance of russian peacekeepers i think that is an appropriate outcome
4222544 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago
4222545 lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not what is in it the cargo in reality it is of major concern to russians
4222546 not all hemangiomas need treatment actually the majority does not but a significant minority does
4222547 so the real message of our study is that patients with hemangiomas that are at high risk for complication or need treatment should be identified early and referred as soon as possible

4222549 were seeing some good indicators around the state home sales going up price of fuel going down
4222550 they want to know that permitting and regulations are walls that are broken down
4222551 ruled out the use of us military force in georgia saying there was no prospect of american troops being deployed in the region military personnel will only be used in a humanitarian capacity to deliver aid to civilians gates said
4222552 foi uma etapa bastante movimentada e dura como se previa embora teoricamente seja classificada como uma etapa f cil o vento a dist ncia e o pr prio calor alentejano dificultaram a vida aos ciclistas mas pela nossa parte procuramos fazer aquilo que nos compete que controlar a corrida e foi isso que aconteceu
4222553 tentamos colocar o c ndido para o sprint mas n o foi poss vel porque a integra o na linha da frente n o chegou a completar se esta chegada era inteiramente ao jeito do napolitano e n o era t o favor vel s caracter sticas do c ndido mas as dele ainda est o para vir
4222554 o benfica como lhe competia trabalhou na persegui o aos fugitivos e s na parte final tivemos a ajuda da lampre e da barbot mas a fuga nunca ofereceu grande perigo para ganhar temos de trabalhar e foi isso que fizemos hoje
4222555 amanh vamos tentar manter a camisola amarela e controlar a marcha da corrida as diferen as s o ainda muito pequenas mas vamos tentar que a equipa continue na frente da corrida
4222556 i did a lot of different things this off season
4222557 we went back to the basics we worked every single day to get more consistency of technique so that no matter what situation i am in im able to get off a good punt
4222558 the appointment of kevin odea as special teams coach who is more of a punting specialist has certainly helped me out
4222559 last year i had to get a job and i was fighting hard for that
4222560 the pressure was that i had to show what i can do this year i have to maintain and improve on every little bit
4222561 he made progress as the season went along and i think hes picked up where he left off
4222562 were pleased with where hes at at this point theres some things he needs to work on but hes doing well
4222563 i would be saying to myself ive got a real chance here to play kids experiment and along the way actually lose and get a crack at a priority pick
4222564 whilst the players will be trying im not so sure the club will be keen
4222565 theres many ways to minimise a sides effectiveness its all about the spirit the preparation the intensity and the motivation as well as selections and rotations
4222566 once the games on no one deliberately tries to lose its just a matter of whether you give yourself the best chance of winning
4222567 im sure the recruiting boys and those in the back office will be hoping like hell they compete well but get beaten
4222568 the initial disappointment of losing would be devastating but then come trade time and draft time theyd be pretty rapt
4222569 i would have thought both coaches would be trying hard
4222570 i reckon dean would trying a little bit harder though
4222571 its just a fact of where both clubs are at
4222572 whats the benefit of winning and whats the benefit of losing
4222573 of course the answer is theres more to be gained by losing than winning
4222574 youd be saying we want a winning ethos but were not going to play finals footy
4222575 if we win does that help us next year the answer is no it doesnt
4222576 how do you go about it you cant come out and say were going to tank
4222577 i think west coast showed last week they were fair dinkum
4222578 ive never believed in it you cant even think about it when youre talking about the culture of your club
4222579 a coach cant get that across to his players and get away with it
4222580 i have no doubt that there are a number of players who could have auctioned themselves but to do that they would have had to use a public means to put pressure on the club and the quality of these guys here they dont play it that way evans said
4222581 they have said they wanted to play at hawthorn and you always get a deal done if they want that
4222582 i think most clubs are fairly diligent with that now most clubs are well geared at trying to pick players off the edge
4222583 there will always be a balance between the opportunities a player gets and the progress they are making but i am confident we will be ok
4222584 the best thing about the negotiations is they havent been about a dollar value the strongest message to come out is this commitment from a large group of players towards hawthorns quest for success he said
4222585 part of that stems back to luke hodge sam mitchell and lance franklin who over the last 12 18 months could have auctioned themselves to another club for more money and decided what was happening at hawthorn was a chance they couldnt turn down
4222586 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4222587 im diesem werkthread steht ausschlie lich das werk selbst also die beitr ge der einzelnen kapitelschreiber je kapitel ein post lediglich dieser erste post stellt hier eine ausnahme dar in der inhaltsdiskussion wird wie der name schon sagt der inhalt diskutiert zu jedem kapitel sollten informationen vom autoren in den diskussionsthread geschrieben werden z b was er sich dabei gedacht hat welche fragen er bewusst offen gelassen hat manchmal schwer zu erkennen ohne hinweise usw auch wird in der diskussion die grobe richtung der geschichte bestimmt und ideen vorgestellt zu denen sich die anderen autoren u ern k nnen solltest du also planen den hauptakteur der geschichte sofern es denn einen gibt beide beine und einen arm abzunehmen solltest du das erst abkl ren sonst entsteht ein wirrwarr bei dem sich m glicherweise andere schreiber nicht mehr wohl f hlen und gewisse geschehnisse anderer autoren bergehen weil sie sie einfach nicht m gen wenn du ein kapitel schreiben willst musst du es dir reservieren das l uft folgenderma en ab ich werde auf diesen anfangsthread sofort eine antwort posten in der ich mir das erste kapitel reserviere in dieser reservierung steht zun chst mal reservierung der bersichtlichkeit halber und noch was man so schreiben will wenn man denn unbedingt noch was zu sagen hat allerdings keine diskussion oder fragen die haben ihren eigenen thread der reservist der der reserviert hat dann genau 10 tage zeit das n chste kapitel zu schreiben und es in den reservierungspost per edit hineinzuschreiben in diesem editierten post steht dann nichts mehr von reservierung sondern nur noch zwei waagrechte striche einfach ganz viele bindestriche hintereinander dazwischen das kapitel samt titel wie der titel aussieht wird in meinem ersten kapitel festgelegt und soll fortgef hrt werden und nach dem zweiten waagrechten strich noch das sekundengenaue datum der editierung dieses datum braucht man um zu kontrollieren ob der n chste der reserviert auch wirklich erst nach der ver ffentlichung des letzten kapitels reserviert hat verpasst der reservist die zehnt gige frist kann man sich das kapitel wieder reservieren kommt dem reservisten etwas dazwischen und hat er dadurch keine zeit oder m glichkeit mehr das kapitel zu ver ffentlichen sollte er am besten seine reservierung per edit datumsangabe gut sichtbar aufheben dann ist das n chste kapitel wieder f r andere frei sollte man sich ein kapitel reservieren und stellt fest dass man doch zu sp t kam sollte man die reservierung ebenfalls gut sichtbar aufheben hier keine datumsangabe n tig hinweise zum kapitelschreiben an sich beachte den diskussionsthread wenn du ein kapitel schreiben willst sollte es mindestens 4000 zeichen haben das ist etwa so viel wie dieser erste post jedes

beachte den diskussionsthread respektiere den bisherigen handlungsverlauf sofern nicht alle au er dem verantwortlichen damit auch nicht zufrieden sind und ignoriere ihn nicht nur weil du dir das vielleicht anders vorgestellt hast zerst re die handlung nicht schwerwiegende handlungskehrtwenden ohne absprache mit den anderen autoren diskussionsthread sind u erst unerw nscht gib dir m he in

keine schiefen oder krummen oder kurvigen stra en das mag mit der mentalit t zusammenh ngen die die erbauer dieser stra en und h user damals erf llte es war eine zielgerichtete und um ziele zu

logische schlussfolgerung also gut dann eben bauten wichtig sich so abzulenken abzulenken von bedenken die ihr durch den kopf flattern w rden hielte sie sie nicht mit den fangnetzen ihres unwichtigen nebens chlichen denkens zur ck schon die falsche richtung sich mit gedanken an bedenken von diesen abzulenken gelingt nur selten die m glichkeiten sich abzulenken werden aber auch immer weniger erst das mit dem arm jetzt be ugt sie ihn gerade erst das mit dem arm dann das mit der stadt und jetzt auch noch diese verdammten bedenken was k nnte wenn was h tte w hrend weil warum und wom glich hypothetisch k nnte eventuell ja dann doch entgegen aller wahrscheinlichkeit schwamm in die hand weg mit den gedanken von der gedankentafel es ist richtig und notwendigkeit das zu tun sie hatte doch

lieber in den nachthimmel der jetzt sogar da ist nicht nur sch ner klingt bemerkenswerterweise macht es keinen unterschied ob man das wort nachthimmel spricht oder denkt es klingt genau gleich so

place inside my brain another kind of pain you dont know the chances im so blind another place i find to escape the pain inside you dont know the chances what if i should die a place inside my brain another kind of pain you dont know the chances im so blind to burn to burn to burn cause im trying to live a life that seems to be a lost reality i can never find no way to reach my inner self im staying low how deep can i go in the ground that i lay if i dont find a way to seek through the gray that clouds my mind this time i look to see whats between the lines i can see i can see im going blind dunkelheit schw rze die zu allen seiten herabf llt leere hinterlassend schweben taumel die leere so unerf llt und haltlos dass man angst bekommt angst wo angst ist muss etwas sein das diese angst empfindet pl tzlich wird sich der funke seiner selbst gewahr und fragt sich was er sei ein lichtblitz zerrei t die schw rze glei end grell und schmerzhaft ein weiterer folgt und der funke f hlt einen sog der ihn hinabrei t in einen strudel rot und laut pochend und zitternd fort ist die schw rze und mystische muster bilden sich arabeskenhaft am rande des lichtes welches nun konstant flackernd bleibt der funke ist angekommen er wei nun wer er ist und was geschehen war und am liebsten w rde er wieder zur ck hinaus in diese barmherzige vergessenheit in diese welt der empfindungslosen entstofflichung denn das was er nun f hlt ist schmerz dumpfer und wunder schmerz an der schulter und stechend im kopf dort wo sich das linke auge befindet die b rde eines k rpers die noch schwerer zu tragen ist wenn dieser verletzt ist st hnend macht marian onoko den versuch sich zu bewegen daran sich aufzurichten kann er im moment noch gar nicht denken er versucht es mit dem rechten arm auch er schmerzt aber nicht so sehr wie der linke und das auch nur an einigen stellen also scheint er dort nicht so sehr verwundet zu sein der arm hebt sich zwar erst nachdem marian den betreffenden muskeln befohlen hatte dies zu tun aber es geht er f hrt seine hand an sein gesicht dabei f llt ihm auf dass er nicht richtig sehen kann er ist sich sicher die augen ge ffnet zu haben aber er sieht nur schemen seines armes und um ihn herum farben die wie schlieren den bewegungen nachziehen auch als er seine hand ganz dicht an seinen augen hat aber wenigstens kann er erkennen dass es eine hand ist und sie noch alle finger hat er versucht den linken arm zu heben ein vorhaben das mit einem scharfen blutroten schmerz gestraft wird der ihm fast wieder das bewusstsein raubt er bleibt eine weile still wartet bis sein atem sich wieder beruhigt hat und testet seine beine die ihm gl cklicherweise nicht den gehorsam verweigern auch wenn sie schmerzen und vermeintlich einige zentner schwer zu sein scheinen dass er nichts sehen kann raubt ihm fast den verstand verzweifelt reibt er sich die augen ohne erfolg er blickt in den himmel zumindest muss der dort oben irgendwo sein aber marian sieht nur wei es licht und am rande des gesichtsfeldes kleine pixel die gewissheit dass seine implantate zerst rt sein m ssen und dies die folge davon ist trifft ihn mit zerm rbender h rte er wei dass er ohne die implantate praktisch aufgeschmissen ist denn er war blind geboren worden seine eltern hatten sich f r diesen kunstfehler nat rlich damals eine gro e summe geld als entsch digung ausbezahlen lassen denn das labor hatte bersehen dass das gen f r seinen berragend hohen iq welches man ausgew hlt hatte in verbindung der gene seiner eltern f r blindheit verantwortlich war soviel zum thema berlegte und berlegene forschung und der macht ber die natur trotzdem nahmen seine eltern ihn als ihren sohn an was f r ihre gesellschaftsschicht nicht blich gewesen w re einige solcher irrt mer fristeten ihr sp teres dasein in waisenh usern oder an schlimmeren orten marian hingegen genoss alle vorz ge des reichtums in den er hineingeboren wurde seine eltern dieses beraus ehrgeizige wie repr sentative paar haruki onoko technikmogul und leiter einer gro en firma f r sensorelektronische ger te und zellbiologin jaqueline troyat widmeten viel zeit und energie der erforschung von implantaten die blinden das augenlicht wiedergeben k nnen nach ihrem erfolg konnten sie nicht nur ihrem sohn doch noch die welt zeigen nebenbei wurden sie auch noch reicher als sie es schon von haus aus waren und onoko wurde an die spitze der m chtigsten m nner dieser welt katapultiert sie taten eigentlich nie etwas aus n chstenliebe vielleicht war sogar seine blindheit kein zufall doch haruki onoko ist vergangenheit marian bef rchtet nein er ahnt dass sein vater nicht mehr lebt im grunde hatte sie vielleicht sogar recht damit gehabt aber es ist nicht richtig so kann man die dinge nicht zum guten ndern denkt er verzweifelt und w tend ob seine mutter noch lebt wei er nicht er hofft es jedoch sehr nun ist es also wahr geworden nie h tte er es f r m glich gehalten seine welt war perfekt gewesen alles war perfekt gewesen wieso h tte er daran je zweifel haben sollen sie ist daran schuld sie hat es tats chlich getan sie die er vor einer woche bei einer demonstration gesehen hatte und die schnurstracks auf ihn zuging ihn an seiner seidenkrawatte packte und ihn anfuhr dass solche leute wie er daf r verantwortlich seien verantwortlich f r was er hatte sie weggesto en er erinnert sich daran wie er es in diesem moment bedauerte ein so h bsches m dchen von sich wegschubsen zu m ssen unter anderen gegebenheiten h tte er vielleicht seinen charme sein exotisches u eres und sein geld spielen lassen nur f r den spa einer nacht er kann sich das leisten er hat von allem viel zu bieten obwohl er nun zweifel daran hat dass all das viele geld das er sein eigen nennt berhaupt noch einen nutzen f r ihn hat oder ob sein gesicht immer noch makellos ist nach diesem unfall alles hat sich f r ihn ge ndert auf jeden fall hat sie es tats chlich durchgezogen ihm schaudert er hatte sie doch gewarnt er hatte versucht sie davon abzuhalten aber letztendlich hatte sie ihn zweifeln lassen an seiner perfekten welt sie hatte ihn sogar dazu gebracht seinen vater zu verraten er musste sie finden vielleicht hat sie es doch noch nicht getan vielleicht l sst sich alles noch umwenden und schlimmes vermeiden er hatte notlanden m ssen wohl weil sie eines der kabel manipuliert hatte auf jeden fall war der motor mitten im flug ausgefallen sie hatte es gewusst dass er es versuchen w rde sie von ihrem vorhaben abzubringen und vorsorge getroffen diese verr ckte aber eine h bsche und u erst faszinierende verr ckte in ihrer rachsucht das muss er sich wiederholt und ungern eingestehen er fingert nach der t r ein schwieriges unterfangen ffnet sie und l t sich aus dem sitz herausfallen danach braucht er wieder einige zeit bis er in der lage ist nach etwas zu suchen auf das er sich aufst tzen kann aus den schatten und schemen um ihn herum bilden sich befremdliche muster die aber durchaus eine struktur besitzen um ihn herum liegen fragmente teile der cessna die er geflogen hatte auf allen vieren oder besser nur auf drei extremit ten denn sein linker arm scheint gebrochen oder ausgerenkt zu sein auf jeden fall kann er ihn nicht bewegen kriecht er umher und tastet um sich nach einigen m hseligen minuten erfassen seine finger eine stange sicher die strebe unterhalb einer tragfl che er pr ft nach ob sich irgendwo scharfe kanten befinden was aber gl cklicherweise nicht der fall ist und zieht sich langsam hoch niemand scheint in der n he zu sein zumindest h rt er nichts das menschlich klingt er h

schiebt sie die kugel in eine freie kammer dann die zweite und die dritte mit einem klicken rastet die trommel ein vivian schiebt den stuhl zur ck und steht auf mit bed chtigen schritten durchquert sie den raum vorbei an dem sessel in dem sie das verh r geplant hat und hinein in den lichtkreis der stehlampe wach auf schreit sie pl tzlich au er sich seine augenlider flattern nach oben er hebt m

erfahren hat sie nichts das verh r hat nicht den alten gebrochen sondern sie selbst warum ist es so verdammt schwer jemandem schmerzen zuzuf gen warum musste sie sich immer wieder daran erinnern wie sehr sie ihn hasst nach dem verh r hatte sie sich noch eine line zur beruhigung geschoben mit schaudern erinnert sie sich an die alptr ume danach die sie zusammengekauert in der anderen ecke des raums durchgemacht hat stunden muss es gedauert haben so dunkel wie es drau en schon ist ein zweites verh r kommt nicht in frage so viel steht fest also muss jetzt das ende folgen sie atmet tief durch baut

jetzt nicht versagen er ist schuld murmelt sie er hat es verdient mag sein h rt sie den alten sagen es ist das erste mal dass er spricht seit sie ihn auf den stuhl gebunden hat seine stimme klingt hei er verbraucht von einem langen leben und gezeichnet von den strapazen der folter und trotzdem schwingt noch eine spur von st hlerner h rte in ihr mit ein paar jahre zuvor h tte er sich nicht so leicht berrumpeln und gefangen setzen lassen ich kann nicht behaupten dass ich ein friedliches leben hatte eine kugel am ende w re passend vielleicht habe ich sie sogar verdient eigenartige worte von solch

4222588 since i have to pay the bills well make sure to turn off the lights
4222589 i think it would be a shame if they tore it down
4222590 i can say consistently it has cost about 100 000 more to operate than it brings in
4222591 its probably 25 percent of what it might have been 25 years ago
4222592 but hell listen very carefully to what the committee recommends
4222593 for us the building is familiar and it feels like home
4222594 but we know from living here that its a burden on the diocese weve watched the use decline over the last five or six years
4222595 were trying to be realistic about it but theres some emotional stuff going on
4222596 whenever im having someone come out from town i tell them to look for that
4222597 the people of the community that grew up in my era weve watched one school after another be destroyed theyre almost all gone now
4222598 i hate to hear that they would even consider tearing it down im not a bit in favor of that at all
4222599 we would get a piece of bread wrapping you know wax paper and kind of slick up the seat so youd slide faster and better we werent supposed to go down it but we did
4222600 why would you save the larson building why would you save the church building that became the performing arts center there in yakima its in the category
4222601 i think if everybody puts their heads together we can come up with a decent use for it
4222602 look what theyve done in tieton to the warehouse up there
4222603 if somebody wanted to donate a million dollars to renovate the building
4222604 i dont see us having the resources to transform it into a modern retreat facility
4222605 people shouldnt expect a wrecking ball out there anytime soon
4222606 what if the baby is like 12 or 13 pounds
4222607 if the baby is 12 pounds its not going to come out
4222608 well yeah i crave ice cream all the time so that doesnt seem that strange
4222609 its not as bad as it was though so thats good
4222610 i couldnt swallow hardly at all so i couldnt eat or drink much fluids
4222611 i was tired and just laying around and kept falling asleep most of the day
4222612 i think he just finally put some food in him and were going to try to get him out doing some baseball related activity
4222613 swing the bat in the cage ride the bike and jog a little bit and see how he goes from there
4222614 it was unfortunate that it happened but you just deal with it and go forward
4222615 i wont run on a national ticket in 08 on live tv no further comment necessary for this lie
4222616 did i ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while i sat in church yes
4222617 would you be willing to meet separately without precondition during the first year of your administration in washington or anywhere else with the leaders of iran syria venezuela cuba and north korea in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries
4222618 i am a christian and i am a devout christian i believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of jesus christ i believe that that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life but most importantly i believe in the example that jesus set by feeding the hungry and healing the sick and always prioritizing the least of these over the powerful i didnt fall out in church as they say but there was a very strong awakening in me of the importance of these issues in my life i didnt want to walk alone on this journey accepting jesus christ in my life has been a powerful guide for my conduct and my values and my ideals there is one thing that i want to mention that i think is important part of what weve been seeing during the course this campaign is some scurrilous e mails that have been sent out denying my faith talking about me being a muslim suggesting that i got sworn in the u s senate with a quran in my hand or that i dont pledge allegiance to the flag i think its really important for your readers to know that i have been a member of the same church for almost 20 years and i have never practiced islam i am respectful of the religion but its not my own one of the things thats very important in this day and age is that we dont use religion as a political tool and certainly that we dont lie about religion as a way to score political points i just thought it was important to get that in there to dispel rumors that have been over the internet weve done so repeatedly but obviously its a political tactic of somebody to try to provide this misinformation
4222619 may i be willing to make the same excuses for other people that i make for myself
4222620 coming out of western carolina i thought we played well for about fifty of the ninety minutes and did some nice things and started playing the kind of soccer we have been working on all preseason weve been working on our defensive shape going into central michigan were looking to be more consistent and put a ninety minute game together with this being so early in the season its going to be hard to obtain a ninety minute game but at the same time every time we step onto the field were looking to get better
4222621 i wanted to keep the pain to myself son but now it cuts straight through me do you understand it cuts straight through me
4222622 i found that even 2 500 years ago sophocles was using words like shell shocked and the thousand yard stare those are things that you hear today
4222623 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4222624 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4222625 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue
4222626 we know that greek drama was theater for combat veterans by combat veterans
4222627 a divine madness poisoned his mind tainting his name during the night
4222628 from baghdad with love a marine the war and dog named lava
4222629 the war came home with my husband all four times
4222630 its the longest running shirt design in america western or otherwise
4222631 i guess i was just lucky that every kid wants to be a cowboy
4222632 we like to test their courage every once in a while they did a nice job they passed
4222633 he didnt catch 111 balls in junior college without doing some great things were excited now we have to keep him on the field that is the key to keep him healthy and keep him out here every day
4222634 we still have a couple weeks left and still have some sorting out to do
4222635 hopefully well have that solidified by a week from saturday its getting closer but theyre still 1 and 1 a like weve talked about and whoever takes the first snap in the game is inconsequential its a matter of getting them both healthy and ready to go
4222636 i learned fast you cant sell to cowboys they have no money
4222637 you have to appeal to the cowboy in everyone and sell to them
4222638 one of the biggest impressions on me is elvis presley he wore rockmount shirts
4222639 i never wanted to be the richest man in the cemetery
4222640 i think that our system is trying to treat everybody under a particular brand and it doesnt work
4222641 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its needless and its not warranted
4222642 i understand how everybody deserves a second chance and all but im not willing to risk my children and my neighbors to find out if theyre rehabilitated or not
4222643 my evolution in this whole process if its meant to create positive change then great im all for that
4222644 its what i call a tough policy thats not smart
4222645 for i will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sin no more
4222646 i think jomama has a keen understanding of government society most people war the media do gooders do badders evolution feminism marxism don and nalini and subatomic particles
4222647 what do you think is the real difference between the republican party and the democratic party
4222648 in order to begin to repair our great nations infrastructure global reputation educational system health care system economic downward slide and the myriad of other problems sweeping changes are in order
4222649 scoffers will come in the last days saying where is the promise of his coming
4222650 they deliberately forget that god made the heavens and earth by the word of his command
4222651 god used water to destroy the ancient world with a mighty flood
4222652 by the same word the present heavens and earth have been stored up for fire being kept for the day of judgement that on that day he will set the heavens on fire and the elements will melt with fervent heat
4222653 definitely i should have made that play hands down nine times out of 10 i dont miss that play but one play doesnt make a game thats the way that it is we lost and life goes on you have to move forward
4222654 but like i said you can have a guy make a million plays in practice but it doesnt mean anything now when it counts is in a game the only thing you can go off of is production in games he has been very productive in games
4222655 the polarisation of wealth across the age groups and the significant increase in consumer debt levels spurred by a growing divide between house prices and household income levels has resulted in an increase in the number of australian households at risk of mortgage default
4222656 surprisingly despite the marked distribution in wealth to the baby boomers their collective appetite for leveraged finance remains undiminished with those in the 45 59 age group holding over a third of the nations debt
4222657 consequently many younger australians have been crowded out of the property market altogether and many more are now dependent on credit providers
4222658 i wanted to keep the pain to myself son but now it cuts straight through me do you understand it cuts straight through me
4222659 i found that even 2 500 years ago sophocles was using words like shell shocked and the thousand yard stare those are things that you hear today

4222666 the war came home with my husband all four times
4222667 i dont know how i can ever say that i am sorry
4222668 i will be sorry for the rest of my life
4222669 we have a lot of hard work ahead of us
4222670 we did finish last in the nfc east we have to make sure we buckle ourselves down like we have the last couple weeks here and finish the rest of camp and preseason the right way it hasnt been easy and it wont be easy once we get into the grind its tough to climb back up that ladder
4222671 we are very fortunate to have all three of them
4222672 right now we are just in the process of getting a support staff set up for him in philadelphia
4222673 we have taken and made some direction there or at least have it going in the right direction there
4222674 clinical depression is a serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel the way you think and how you act
4222675 during the winter my depression seem to deepen and worsen because of the lack of adequate sunlight
4222676 alcohol does seem to be the prevalent substance of choice among many victims of depression although other illicit drugs can contribute to the effects of depression
4222677 the storm guys are pushing a little hard to try and keep some attention they seem to be climbing trees to find something anything
4222678 in 2002 spokane washington journalist sherry jones toiled weekends on a racy historical novel about aisha the young wife of the prophet muhammad
4222679 just past two i need you to go to the all night market for me

4222687 i thought since you were so slim thats what youd need there was a really huge woman buying the super plus kind and i thought uh i wasnt sure
4222688 super plus means they absorb a lot more it doesnt have anything to do with how a womans built didnt you know that

4222708 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4222709 i imagine that many judges will think there has to be some judicial forum to hear at least these core claims about torture
4222710 whether every single claim deserves a judicial forum i cant predict but i have to think that the part most objectionable is that nothing raised here gets any hearing whatsoever under any statute
4222711 torture is never acceptable nor do we hand over people to countries that do torture
4222712 unfortunately at this time we are unable to process warranty requests in ireland
4222713 if you know anyone in the united states or united kingdom that we could send a replacement pedal to for you we can do that
4222714 can you please tell why having paid 240 you cannot provide support to ireland surely if the game is on sale here then it should be covered by warranty this doesnt really make any sense to me at all
4222715 oh yeah you bet been sick for almost 2 days so ive got some catching up to do
4222716 alcoholics anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism
4222717 it used to be so simple labour would come up with plausible critiques of the conservatives that resonated with the public the public would agree with them and labour could get on with maintaining large opinion poll leads
4222718 a same old tories approach is implausible with much of the public and the new tories new danger approach concedes that the old critique should be ditched at a time when cameron is offering little of substance on which to build a new one
4222719 there are hints at the beginnings of a new labour critique of the conservatives
4222720 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4222721 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases

4222726 voor mij is dit een rustige dag tijdens het maken van de film ik ken de muziek al
4222727 dit is een mythische studio the beatles en u2 hebben hier gewerkt
4222728 ik was ondersteboven van de film het is geweldig om mee te kunnen werken aan een goed project
4222729 voor de ontknoping heb ik een stuk van 14 minuten geschreven dat gebaseerd is op een riedel van een viool met slechts twee noten
4222730 look shes going to fight the bad guy goooo princess look now the prince and princess are fighting the bad guys together they are helping each other run princess run
4222731 it also had cover art that completely misrepresented the target age group for the movie making it look like it was aimed at preschoolers
4222732 not surprisingly some parents who bought the dvd for their very young children because of this misleading cover were upset to find that the film contained a harpy with three breasts a magically animated treee with huge breasts and a character who shouted damn you
4222733 peters opinion is that he regrets it and would change it if he could
4222734 but he also recognizes that it isnt his decision and feels that mollys reaction to seeing a unicorn for the first time is still emotional enough thanks to tammy grimes marvelous voice performance to get his point across
4222735 he suggests that fans who are really upset by the omission shout damn you at the screen at the right moment
4222736 for a 54 year old russian president vladimir putin looks pretty buff

4222743 i remember sitting in my house in california as a youth watching the pele instructional videos over and over
4222744 soccer was taking off in my neighborhood and all my friends wanted to do was imitate his moves we had never seen anything like it
4222745 coming here to santos is a life long dream of mine
4222746 and to be able to share this moment and a passion for the game with my daughter well its just a bit overwhelming
4222747 pause you who read this and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold of thorns or flowers that would never have bound you but for the formation of the first
4222748 i understand it to some point if i put myself into a favre fanatics shoes
4222749 the things i cant understand the things i really take personally is when im driving up to the parking lot gate and punching in my punch code and somebody says expletive to me that kind of bothers me
4222750 or when a little kid is yelling swear words at me that kind of gets to me they expect a high level of play and they miss brett favre i understand that but the expletive and the little kids saying swear words to me i dont understand that
4222751 this is about generating new revenue streams for musicians the record companies take a piece of the tour and the merchandise but they cant take a piece of this
4222752 i cant believe im entrusted with the legacy of the most famous words in the world
4222753 i realized i could help musicians generate new revenue without feeling like theyre selling out
4222754 its almost like shes giving a scholarship to these people who are being creative
4222755 it by itself is not going to save the music industry but its certainly a nice plus
4222756 no matter how successful youve been the business depends on continuing success
4222757 theyre happy to have every source of revenue they can get
4222758 i think she didnt like having another woman in the house
4222759 and they have a no shoes in the house policy they have gorgeous hardwood or lush carpeting everywhere but in the guest bedroom where the thick sisal rug is so fierce its like walking on razor blades even with socks on we need medical attention
4222760 we were convinced it was a passive aggressive anti guest policy
4222761 we took on the challenge though and this year we outsmarted the killer sisal with our secret bedroom slippers and laughed ourselves to sleep
4222762 well i see someone is taking the idea of vacation literally
4222763 i always use the green part the white is so pungent
4222764 the guest is therefore in some way an economically or practically weaker party furthermore the guest has been chosen for precisely this reason by the host after all an equal wouldnt accept an invitation an equal would be at his or her house with his or her own guests
4222765 the inferior guest has to work for his or her supper has to be deferential and primarily grateful repressing natural holiday urges to sit around grumpily and not help with practical chores and turn down invitations to local attractions the guest is on duty instead of money guests pay for their presence with liveliness and flattery
4222766 what did i do wrong when women dont tell each other the friendship is over
4222767 you have to have family in laws and by the time i come that person is pretty sick of having guests
4222768 were all used to doing things in our way particularly in our free time we all need to get certain things out of a weekend or vacation one person has to exercise or they go crazy the other person needs to sleep 10 hours
4222769 are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee
4222770 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong unified fashion
4222771 i dont think that the roll call would necessarily be that productive
4222772 maxconn 1 for each mongrel this is intentionally unfair but the object is not a comparison of haproxy and nginx when each is configured identically rather i would like to observe what kind of performance profile can be achieved with haproxys superior gadgetry
4222773 i am recording everything of my life and youre in my camera
4222774 gaining a deeper understanding of peoples attitudes and behaviors toward privacy
4222775 when you really want to learn something you need to get your hand wet and do something all by yourself

4222802 the greater fear right now is missing the next big rally
4222803 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better
4222804 there has been a sufficient amount of pessimism to warrant a short term rally
4222805 i wanted to keep the pain to myself son but now it cuts straight through me do you understand it cuts straight through me
4222806 i found that even 2 500 years ago sophocles was using words like shell shocked and the thousand yard stare those are things that you hear today
4222807 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4222808 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4222809 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue
4222810 we know that greek drama was theater for combat veterans by combat veterans
4222811 a divine madness poisoned his mind tainting his name during the night
4222812 from baghdad with love a marine the war and dog named lava
4222813 the war came home with my husband all four times
4222814 overall and maybe inevitably tropic thunder is uneven and ultimately its disposable but what smug fun there is to be had from the notion that the whole overblown enterprise might be justified by this one formerly uninsurable actors performance alone
4222815 his role is no one note race joke its a densely layered little study of american racial anxiety
4222816 he plays a ridiculously extreme thespian with an equally po faced intensity watching lazarus preach against the perils of going full retard to win awards or bemoan how the n word has held his people down with such misguided gravitas you cant help but admire downeys dynamic act of comic jujitsu
4222817 whats most notable about the films use of blackface is how much softer it is compared with the rather more vulgar and far less loving exploitation of what you might call jewface
4222818 hands down the most noxious character in tropic thunder is les grossman the producer of the movie within a movie whos played by an almost unrecognizable under a thick scum of makeup and latex heavily and heavy handedly coded as jewish the character is murderous repellent and fascinating a grotesque from his swollen fingers to the heavy gold dollar sign nestled on his yeti furred chest at one time mr stiller wanted to adapt what makes sammy run to the screen a long dormant and now perhaps lost project that haunts this otherwise safe film like a wrathful ghost
4222819 a parody of war movies and a pinprick in the helium balloon of hollywood egos tropic thunder caps a hectic summer of action films and star driven comedies and is designed as a blend and a semiloving critique of both genres
4222820 the picture is savvy to the max maybe to excess but stiller who also directed and co wrote the movie surely figures that in the blogosphere age no film can be too inside its where everyone is
4222821 over the years a few genuine boundary shattering comedies have managed to sneak out of the major studios scott foundas
4222822 but more often than not the most gleefully irreverent movies come from devil may care mavericks working on the margins of independent cinema movies like pink flamingos or even more to the point the early and largely forgotten films of downeys own father putney swope imagined what might happen if a prominent madison avenue advertising firm were suddenly overtaken by militant blacks those movies had and continue to have more sting than anything in tropic thunder which is ultimately just another movie about moviemaking better than some state and main comes to mind not as good as others s o b occasionally willing to bite the hand that feeds it but more often content to merely teethe
4222823 tropic thunder is ridiculous and deeply enjoyable but it also flashes a mercilessly polished mirror at the prestige products that the movie business so glibly feeds us in order to reflect glory back on itself
4222824 the picture also questions the way we congratulate ourselves for our appreciation of serious pictures and dedicated performances as if by applauding their quality we might somehow be connected with some greater good movies can elevate us helping us locate the best most generous parts of ourselves but that doesnt diminish the fact as tropic thunder so painfully reminds us that quality movies are sometimes made by absolute assholes
4222825 easily the funniest movie ive seen this year a riotous high octane side splitter that delivers more laughs than a dozen standard studio comedies
4222826 but actor director ben stillers satire of pampered hollywood actors and out of control action epics mines humor from a wide variety of sources resulting in a film that delivers wall to wall laughs even if by the time its all over you realize you dont give a tinkers damn about anyone on screen
4222827 hollywoods easy pickings and making fun of it is what insiders do when theyve emptied their arsenal
4222828 tropic thunder which drops a bunch of actors into the wilds of southeast asia and shouts action doesnt stray far from convention save for a little added gore firepower and star power worthy of its nearly 100 million budget
4222829 its the kind of summer comedy that rolls in makes a lot of people laugh and rolls on to video
4222830 its been a good summer for that look at noting that both films
4222831 in a shot mournfully photographed by nolte stares out at the jungle mists from a mountain perch and answers a query about a weapon with i dont know what its called but i know the sound that it makes when it takes a mans life its like out of nowhere ten seconds of
4222832 stillers performance is easily the weakest element of zoolander character he only has a handful of exaggerated expressions and he cycles through them on cue but its easy to forgive him given how thoroughly enjoyable tropic thunder is on virtually every other count
4222833 offers a number of genuine laughs between the self congratulatory waves its just good enough to make you wish it were better
4222834 ben stiller used to be unafraid of pointed mockery but nowadays he pulls his punches
4222835 stillers barbs have not been this sharply pointed since his early 90s armond white in the
4222836 look past tropic thunder s misleading marketing campaign and its a movie about something director ben stiller well understands the plight insecurity and vanity of actors

4222842 you are joining the oc sheriffs department at a time of change and transformation and you will be part of the effort to make it even better than it is today this is not a career or everyone you are now part of an extraordinary and elite group a group of people who will run to danger and put their lives on the line to help another even when that person is a complete stranger they do this not because they are required by law but because they have the courage and compassion to always do what is right to take the leadership role and to make the hard calls
4222843 an honest attempt to get real answers to an important question
4222844 even those who didnt cite cost as their main reason almost always mentioned it at some stage
4222845 a lot of anger was directed at the retail 60 games and console games people in australia were especially annoyed about higher prices there
4222846 it was interesting to hear so many complaints about actual game design and gameplay not a single person said they had felt ripped off by a game due to substandard visuals or lack of content
4222847 the consensus was that games got boring too quickly were too derivative and had gameplay issues demos were widely considered to be too short and unrepresentative of the final product
4222848 give the other 99 of pirates a bad name and are the reason people dont listen to pirates
4222849 i dont think the whole exercise will have much effect on the wider industry
4222850 doubtless there will be more fps games requiring mainframes to run them more games with games with no demos or games with all glitz and no gameplay i wish this wasnt the case and that the devs could listen more to their potential customers and that the pirates could listen more to the devs rather than abusing them i dont think thats going to happen
4222851 sorry well have to hold off until your next cycle

4222887 stiamo pensando ha detto in unintervista a italia oggi di sganciare le pensioni dal tasso di inflazione ad oggi applicato e di legarle ad una inflazione nuova ovvero alla crescita dei prezzi di un paniere di beni e servizi ad hoc quelli di cui effettivamente fanno consumo i pensionati di quella fascia ci sono gi simulazioni dellistat
4222888 il tema degli ammortizzatori sociali tra i primi punti dellagenda dellautunno e non per detto che debbano essere solo finanziati con soldi pubblici
4222889 e un bene che il ministro voglia allestire un paniere ad hoc per i pensionati quando ci sar il confronto valuteremo nel merito ma la proposta in s va nella direzione auspicata da diverso tempo dal sindacato e dalla commissione istituita per vagliare questa ipotesi in modo che i pensionati possano essere risarciti di ci che perdono con linflazione
4222890 sono gli unici che recuperano ben poco di ci che linflazione sottrae
4222891 e un fatto ha concluso bonanni di ingiustizia ed emergenza sociale allinterno della quale matura anche un meccanismo regressivo economico con i consumi ridotti al lumicino
4222892 la questione di un nuovo paniere per i pensionati ha commentato pirani da tempo stata posta dalle organizzazioni sindacali di categoria
4222893 non pi tempo di proporre bisogna agire subito sulle pensioni minime anche sul fronte fiscale
4222894 il ministro dovrebbe prendere atto che le pensioni nel 2008 sono rivalutate al 1 6 e linflazione oltre il 4 e il 6 per i beni di prima necessit dunque si dovrebbe partire da qui
4222895 sarebbe necessario sottolinea la sindacalista che i pensionati gi in corso danno fossero messi in condizione di avere una difesa del loro potere dacquisto stanno gi pagando il prezzo di uninflazione molto pi elevata rispetto a quella riconosciuta
4222896 i strongly condemn the reign of terror let loose by the indian forces against the besieged people of kashmir
4222897 the indian government should order troops and police to refrain from using lethal force against violent protesters in jammu and kashmir unless absolutely necessary to protect life
4222898 they created an environment like a third world country to simulate those conditions for training its absolutely fascinating
4222899 it is a real revelation that mutc could be playing a vital role in the preparation of soldiers for military operations
4222900 i am very impressed by what the army is doing
4222901 to be able to envision this it was just fascinating that it was all put together that way

4222904 se la russia sta violando il cessate il fuoco ha detto rice nel corso di una conferenza stampa al dipartimento di stato di washington prima di lasciare gli stati uniti e le informazioni che abbiamo in materia non sono incoraggianti questo contribuirebbe allisolamento e dimostrerebbe che mosca non lalleato internazionale che ha detto di voler essere

4222906 alle nazioni unite la francia ha stilato una bozza di risoluzione che incorpora laccordo raggiunto tra russia e georgia
4222907 una rapida adozione di tale risoluzione permettera un significativo consolidamento del cessate il fuoco
4222908 si possono dimenticare le chiacchiere sullintegrit territoriale della georgia perch ritengo impossibile costringere ossezia del sud e abkhazia ad accettare lidea di un ritorno forzato nello stato georgiano
4222909 sono pronti a cooperare con osservatori internazionali ed esaminare proposte sullaumento del numero di quegli osservatori in ossezia del sud un controllo in pi non sar inutile sui perimetri esterni della zona di sicurezza

4222912 pochi minuti fa i russi sono entrati a poti a bordo di carri armati
4222913 alcuni di loro indossano insegne di colore blu distintivi e questo significa che dovrebbe trattarsi di membri del contingente dinterposizione
4222914 ho contato 104 veicoli militari russi inclusi 40 corazzati in maggior parte carri armati
4222915 leffettivo ritiro delle forze di entrambi i paesi lavvio di una costruttiva ricerca nelle opportune sedi internazionali per nuove garanzie di sicurezza e stabilit nellossezia meridionale e in abkhazia costituiscono la concreta prospettiva da perseguire fino al potenziamento e allargamento delle forze di peace keeping nellarea
4222916 quando ho visto che dovevo fare lo spareggio ho pensato adesso li devo rompere sono entrata per romperli
4222917 non stata una finale facile anche per le condizioni meteo ha detto pensavo ci volesse un punteggio pi alto per fare il podio
4222918 con quello che ricever ha spiegato lolimpionica del tiro a volo spero di dare una botta al mutuo
4222919 lo spero magari ben venga ha detto la tiratrice di udine anche se il pensiero dei soldi quando si vince un oro lultimo
4222920 cosa spero magari di essere passata di grado non so qui c un mio superiore e dovrei chiederglielo
4222921 non uno sport che ti d da mangiare e gli allenamenti costano molto ben venga quindi la detassazione dei premi
4222922 questo era laccordo con gli altri e credo sia una bella cosa che dimostra anche lo spirito dei tiratori
4222923 sicuramente la pioggia e la scarsit di luce dovuta alle nuvole hanno reso tutto pi difficile
4222924 io vivo in friuli dove piove spesso e mi sono allenata tanto sotto la pioggia e questo mi ha aiutato
4222925 il mio sport il mio lavoro ma anche il mio sogno non ci credo ancora ma sognando tanto i sogni si avverano
4222926 che sarebbe stata durissima ma ho stretto i denti perch questo sport cos ero in formissima ha aggiunto e con i sacrifici arrivano i risultati
4222927 ho visto il combattimento che bella presa quella per loro
4222928 mi ha fatto tanti complimenti ha raccontato ancora lazzurro e mi ha detto che ci vedremo presto
4222929 a me invece aggiunge federica pellegrini anchessa protagonista stasera alla premiazione coni a casa italia con minguzzi e chiara cainero il presidente ha chiesto se sono contenta e poi ha aggiunto ma sui 400 stile libero cosa successo
4222930 siamo contenti di andare l ha aggiunto casiraghi prima della partenza da tianjin finora abbiamo vissuto al chiuso degli alberghi ora respiriamo laria olimpica
4222931 se ci penso a freddo ha detto il tecnico trovo attenuanti il timore di non arrivare primo il terreno pessimo e la paura dei ragazzi di farsi male avevano la testa ai casi di rocchi e marchisio del giorno prima
4222932 mi dispiace ma dispiace anche ai ragazzi avevamo fatto prima bellissime partite e ben figurato
4222933 il belgio la prima squadra europea che incontriamo sulla nostra strada ha concluso il tecnico azzurro e aggressiva e tecnica e a questo punto della situazione tutte sono avversarie dure questa poi alla soglia della finale per il terzo posto la gara che non puoi fallire
4222934 imply a continuation of only modest expansion in the economy the likelihood of further increases in unemployment for a time and a diminution of inflation absent a resurgence in energy and other commodity prices
4222935 in considering these prospects it is worth recalling that despite early challenges the 1990s turned out to be an excellent decade for the u s economy by almost all metrics
4222936 unemployment interest rates and inflation were all lower at the outset of the latest period of turmoil than in the previous headwinds episode
4222937 equally important the financial condition of both banking and non financial businesses was healthier at the onset of recent problems

4222949 i dont know if it really made a whole lot of sense
4222950 because one of the things they should be doing at least from my perspective is opening up the lines of communication more than closing them down
4222951 i think for the nabc just to mandate when we can offer scholarships and when we cant what we need to be doing is exploring how can we open up the lines of communication more to get to know these kids better
4222952 whether the school offers at any age really comes down to the family and what the family thinks is in the best interest of the kid i dont think anybodys forcing anybody to do anything
4222953 but i think in certain situations if theres a real close relationship you know the person and you know the family the kid has an idea of what he wants to do where he dreamed of going to school its up to the parents to decide whether or not they want to accept a scholarship and end the recruiting process
4222954 knowing where youre going to school all of a sudden you can focus on whats important
4222955 im going to focus on school and im going to focus on getting better
4222956 there are a lot of kids coming into these camps now that are feeling a lot of pressure and stress who really wants me did i play well
4222957 this process everybody thinks its glamorous its great its terrific i dont know if its that way i think it would be great to have a college coach pick up the phone who says dont worry about it go out there and do better tomorrow thats an encouraging thing
4222958 unfortunately the linkup service is no longer available please visit box net for your storage needs

4222975 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4222976 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4222977 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4222978 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4222979 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4222980 spore was very much inspired by many different types of sciences
4222981 we spent a lot of time meeting a lot of scientists very early on in developing this game to find out what areas would be interesting to bring into the game
4222982 were using spore as a nexus for explaining these theories on evolutionary biology
4222983 millions of people contribute content like planets buildings and creatures to your game but its not real time
4222984 youre seeing copies of peoples stuff so you can go up and blow up a planet and you havent ruined their experience
4222985 were exploring using these databases to populate other games where we might have all of the vehicles from the vehicle editor used in a different game under the spore umbrella thats a very different experience than spore

4222987 but the architect has been slow where the physiologist has long been eager to invoke the aid of the physical or mathematical sciences and the reasons for this difference lie deep and are partly rooted in old tradition and partly in the diverse minds and temperaments of men to treat the design process as a mechanism was repugnant and seemed even ludicrous to pascal and goethe lover of nature as he was ruled mathematics out of place in natural history even now the architect has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms when he meets with a simple geometrical construction for instance in the honeycomb he would fain refer it to psychical instinct or to skill and ingenuity rather than to the operation of physical forces or mathematical laws

4223005 the tobacco roller and his son pitched their camp beneath a gum tree upon the edge of the wood

4223007 what is striking about this survey is the ease in which young people can feed their deadly habit for instance 1 in 5 children can buy cigarettes from vending machines why are vending machines still legal when we have restrictions to protect children from this addictive drug

4223009 for wang wei to claim that the beijing olympics has led to greater respect for human rights is an outrageously absurd statement
4223010 the organizers have simply not delivered on their promises of complete media freedom they also continue to detain potential protesters even as they ostensibly allowed protest zones in beijing just like the fake digital fireworks or the insulting singing girl trick at the opening ceremony this is another embarrassing proof that the chinese communist party is trying cover up reality and abusing these games for its own propaganda purposes

4223078 the savvy parent understands that this is just a setup for kids and uses technology to help set up guardrails around those sites
4223079 and the software is usually so crude that it can block legitimate sites

4223149 all right you done asked so im gonna tell you i like sims a lot more of course hes a good worker and seems to understand what the niggers and communists are trying to do to this country thats why i was a little surprised when he put me off
4223150 as for cahill well i can put up with him but im not sure hes the type you could count on in a foxhole if you know what i mean still for a country club college kid i guess hes okay even if frank williams is his uncle
4223151 now speaking as a daddy neither one of those redneck peckerwoods is good enough for my petite minou
4223152 no child im serious darrell rays a good kid but i think hes a little ashamed of his family and thats just no good but i figure its why hes always putting on like hes got everything all figured out when in actual fact even he knows he dont
4223153 now i dont know cahill near bout as well but he seems to be just the opposite i mean he dont have to go around acting cocky and tough and all cause he knows he belongs but maybe cause of that he dont seem anxious to stand up for himself or have a whole lot of push or hustle
4223154 thanks daddy i just wish one of them was more like you
4223155 im afraid youll have to do what your sweet mama did pick yourself out one of dem boys and start breaking him in
4223156 im glad you decided to handle tonights job remember buddy will have everything you need at his place make sure to wait until after dark to pick the stuff up
4223157 look i already done told you all that at the office nobodys ever there on saturday nights ever tobias has had deputies checking out the place for weeks they never ever come home before eleven the only thing you gotta worry about is bringing a lighter okay
4223158 youre going to do fine you know im leaving town early tomorrow morning so dont call me late tonight why dont you come in to work a few minutes early on monday and give me a report
4223159 if id been a jap youd be graveyard dead boy
4223160 hope i didnt make things even worse but i couldnt make the picture stop rolling
4223161 it always does that this time of day but only on that station
4223162 its just a damn good thing its not the one that carries the porter wagoner show i suppose youve seen that new singer of his the one who took the place of pretty miss norma jean

4223164 how were things in baton rouge after old martin lucifer coon got shot
4223165 things were a little tense for a while there were some marches and protests and everybody was on edge the students at southern university are a lot more militant than the ones up at grambling no one was sure what might happen of course baton rouge wasnt a real hot spot at least not in comparison to what went on in some of the towns over towards mississippi
4223166 they can yell and scream all they want we still control things down here and were gonna make sure we stay in control what worries me is out there in california in faggot land and up north in places like jew york city hell all those niggers do is scream about their rights collect welfare checks and chase after white women
4223167 well maybe so sir i dont know i mean ive never been to any of those places myself
4223168 niggers carry the curse of cain its in your bible look it up theyre a sub human jungle race dats being used by the acl jew and all those other commies and queers to take dis country away from the white christian race and by god theyll do it too if we dont stick together
4223169 mr boudreaux ive got a lot of respect for you for what you did in the war and all and i know im just a kid and youve seen and done a lot more than i have but mr boudreaux one of my best friends is willie carter and hes black and im sorry if this disappoints you or makes you mad at me but he and i have been friends forever the thing is mr boudreaux willie may be black but hes not a nigger and hes not sub human
4223170 im not saying theres not some decent niggers hell theres always an exception to every rule if youve known this boy all your life then maybe hes one maybe hes got a little white blood thats brought out the good in him it happens but what about that troublemaking daddy of his the preacher who keeps going around stirring up the niggers and what about his brother the bootlegger hell i guess its a family deal one juices em up saturday night and the other stirs em up sunday morning
4223171 for the love of god shut up im so tired of acting polite while idiots like you rant and rave all this brain dead racist shit all you sad ass losers have done is discredit the south and the flag my ancestors fought and died under why the hell wont you just go away
4223172 so tell me son what are we supposed to do im saying we cant just let the commies and coons come in and take over we gotta fight for our rights for our way of life
4223173 im a southerner mr boudreaux according to dad my great grandfather fought the u s government from shiloh to stone mountain the thing is he and all the rest of those men fought hard but we still lost and now ive got it on good authority those same feds have the atomic bomb
4223174 does make it seem like a stacked deck i guess but just you remember its not the size of the dog in the fight that counts but the size of the fight in the dog
4223175 i am getting a puppy this weekend and i have read your my smart puppy book and watched the video but i am not clear on how to teach the no command please help
4223176 there is widespread recognition among new yorkers that runaway increases in property taxes are deeply hurting our state
4223177 anyone who does not acknowledge this trend is out of touch with working families the longer we wait to approve a property tax cap the more we will hamstring new york from reaching its full economic potential
4223178 well the honky tonks in texas were my natural second home

4223182 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4223183 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4223184 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4223195 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4223196 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4223197 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town
4223198 we go to press in five minutes what do you think about icanns plan to add a million new domains
4223199 they are not heeding the sentiments for change that people expressed in the vote
4223200 distribution is deficient there are absolutely no reserves they havent even done public bidding for health supplies imagine taking power aug 15 and finding no medications or diesel fuel it is a country that could go up in flames within two or three months this is why we say there is a kind of conspiracy to leave state institutions nonfunctioning
4223201 there are backward looking factions within this party who aspire to come back to power early and not democratically
4223202 will not sabotage fernando lugo nor create a climate of hostility during his term
4223203 he is realizing that sometimes you have to deal with the devil to govern
4223204 lugo probably concluded he needed at least short term marriage of convenience to get things done during the first 100 days that will be critical to get political traction and momentum
4223205 is a pretty conventional economist hes going to be reassuring to investors and the international financial community
4223206 the optimistic scenario is he wont accomplish much but he will be well regarded and respected by the people as a president who is not corrupt and does not take bribes

4223219 being a graduate student is like becoming all of the seven dwarves in the beginning youre dopey and bashful in the middle you are usually sick sneezy tired sleepy and irritable grumpy but at the end they call you doc and then youre happy
4223220 what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure
4223221 at the start you may have to do tasks specifically related to the funding contracts
4223222 graduate school is not primarily about taking courses you will take classes in the beginning but in your later years you probably wont have any classes
4223223 your success in graduate school and beyond depends a great deal upon your ability to build and maintain interpersonal relationships with your adviser your committee your research and support staff and your fellow students
4223224 since academia is a type of business you will have responsibilities that you must uphold you will be asked to greet and talk with visitors give demos show up to meetings get projects done on time etc if you are not well organized you will have a difficult time meeting those obligations there are many different time management and organization skills arrange the tasks in priority and you can find many books on those at your local bookstore
4223225 communication skills both written and oral are vital for making a good impression as a ph d student and as a researcher unfortunately not all graduate students receive training in giving presentations or writing technical documents which are different from english essays these are skills that can be learned its not easy but its well worth the investment if you need practice try giving informal talks at research luncheons joining toastmasters and studying good speakers to see what they do
4223226 confidence is the key to giving a good presentation and the way to gain confidence is to give good presentations here are a few basic points organization counts within the first few paragraphs or first few minutes tell me why i should read your paper or listen to your talk make it clear where we are going and what we have already covered make the text in your slides large enough so that people sitting in the back can read them for large presentation halls this usually means no more than 6 7 lines per slide and 28 point type minimum youd be surprised how many experts on visualization especially tenured professors give presentations with unreadable slides variety retains interest vary your pace tone and volume emphasize the important points look around the room throw in some video pictures or live examples dont stand in front of the screen and block everyones view youd be surprised how often people do this without realizing it point out the limitations of your work that helps your credibility similarly give credit where credit is due make friends with the a v crew running a v is a thankless negative reinforcement job if everything runs smoothly well thats what was supposed to happen so nobody says anything but if anything goes wrong the entire audience looks back at the control room help the a v people help you always check in early and test the equipment tell them what you are going to do in your presentation e g im running 3 video segments make sure you know how everything works long before you come up to the podium and thank the a v crew for their help after you are done writing papers and getting them published is vital for ph d students who want to get jobs in research after graduation your ability to write well significantly improves the chances that your paper will be accepted finally dont forget to communicate with your professors and your teammates keep your committee appraised of your progress one thing i do which few others do is write short 1 screenfull status reports which i religiously e mailed to my professors and team members on a weekly basis these serve as an efficient way of keeping everyone up to date on what im doing they are also a good way for me to record my progress if i need to remember what i got done during a six month period i have plenty of old status reports that i can read youd be amazed how appreciative professors and managers are of this simple practice i also throw in a different humorous quote at the end of each weeks report to reward people for reading it when you are working in the lab and you reach a milestone or achieve a result let people know about it bring in your professors and fellow students and show it off thats a win win situation it lets others know that you are making progress and achieving results and you get valuable feedback and advice
4223227 your adviser must be someone who can cover your area of specialization and someone you can get along with and if circumstances change to make another professor a more appropriate match to your needs dont be afraid to switch if that is an overall win
4223228 it is important to have a network get yourself noticed by other professors and industry people

4223235 the extradition procedure is difficult complicated and time consuming and we cannot predict the timetable
4223236 we have to prove that what he did in thailand was wrong under british law
4223237 what about the deer the stuffed creature the art quilt
4223238 you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
4223239 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me yes i am a bit upset about it
4223240 i won seven events if they had the 50 meter freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
4223241 hes a world record holder in all these events so he is dominating the events just like i did he reminds me of myself
4223242 mark was a very talented swimmer and very dominant in his time
4223243 the difference with michael is that he has a much more challenging program i think the competition throughout the world is more challenging
4223244 in 68 mark had tremendous pressure because he had talked a lot about how he was going to surpass don schollander the first swimmer to win four golds at one olympics and he didnt fare very well under the pressure then in 72 he obviously was magnificent michael has been magnificent really since his first olympics when he was the youngest guy on the team
4223245 im sure he can afford a ticket if he wants to be here it would have been nice for him to be here and witness it i really feel he contributed a lot to swimming but its time to turn the reins over to somebody else youve got to move on with life get a life after swimming
4223246 michael stuck his medal through the fence and we were all there it was so special
4223247 he stuck the medal through and was like look what i did i did it i
4223248 i think ive figured out michael phelps hes not from another planet hes from the future his father made him and made a time machine sixty years from now he is an average swimmer but he has come back here to mop up
4223249 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it i just have absolutely nothing to say im speechless
4223250 its a pretty cool title i guess you could say
4223251 it is very hard to be swimming the relay also on the same day as the butterfly i dont know how he is doing this
4223252 everybody is thinking how can he do this and break world record
4223253 i was trying to see the t on the bottom of the pool to try and judge my turn and the finish i was more or less just sort of counting strokes i sort of know how many strokes i take in a 50 and i was hoping i was going to be dead on and i was going to be able to hit the wall perfectly i was able to get my hand on the wall first and it was a best time but i think i was just disappointed that i know i can go faster than that
4223254 it may be once in a century we see something like this
4223255 the rest of the world is catching up to the u s the way i look at it quite a bit for him to be doing what hes doing at this moment in time with the rest of the world coming up the way it is i think that speaks volumes and the way hes attacking this meet too hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying every race its awesome to watch its inspiring to me
4223256 every time i watch him swim im more and more in awe of what he does
4223257 being his teammate and being part of the team while hes doing all this kind of gives us a different perspective i think years and years down the road well realize more and more how amazing and special he is
4223258 its always just one more step when youre kind of at the top of the mountain the steps are pretty high even one more step takes you pretty far away from everyone else
4223259 now what are we supposed to do with these tickets
4223260 this was one more effective way for us to communicate with folks who may not normally see other communications we have with voters who are paying closer attention to the race

4223271 one of the biggest implications that we have seen is womens reluctance to include trans women in women only spaces and racism and white supremacy the connection between those things there was this time when i was at this conferance and there was a trans woman in the room for awhile and finally she had to leave and somebody said
4223272 men masquerading as trans people in order to gain access to shelters and whatever
4223273 does it promote safety and autonomy for survivors and accountability for perpetrators of domestic violence
4223274 in the past i have volunteered at both a rape crisis center and a domestic violence shelter i saw rape victims victims of sexual harassment and women whod been beaten and emotionally abused i remember many of the women saying that a lot of things triggered their memory of the assault things they associated with their assault s
4223275 well i dont have experience with this but my friend

4223277 mcdonalds foray into corporate support of the lesbian gay homosexual and transgendered lgbt community is getting rave reviews from the folks at the national gay amp lesbian chamber of commerce nglcc
4223278 to invest in mcdonalds because of the fact that they are promoting what the fund calls non traditional married lifestyles
4223279 that corporations like mcdonalds continue to publicly and financially support things that alienate their consumer base
4223280 by alienating such a large consumer base the christian community they are undoubtedly neglecting this responsibility

4223290 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4223291 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4223292 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4223293 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4223294 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4223295 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries
4223296 now many of their estuaries and coastal seas are suffering the same malady

4223300 each mystery religion taught its own version of the myth of the dying and resurrecting godman who was known by different names in different places
4223301 during a period of time running roughly from about 1890 to 1940 scholars often alleged that primitive christianity had been heavily influenced by platonism stoicism the pagan religions or other movements in the hellenistic world
4223302 the uncompromising monotheism and the exclusiveness that the early church preached and practised make the possibility of any pagan inroads
4223303 mithraism had no concept of the death and resurrection of its god and no place for any concept of rebirth at least during its early stages

4223318 my oldest daughter came running saying we cant get out the front door i was half asleep at the time and didnt know what she was talking about
4223319 i had to go out of the back door then i saw my car had been done i thought theyd do something but i never expected my door to be bricked up i take it thats my birthday present
4223320 he got shaving foam and cling film and did my car on my birthday so this is payback i did it at 4 30am i had an accomplice but im not saying who
4223321 i thought he might take it a bit to heart but he has not at all its brilliant
4223322 his friends had been talking about doing something but i didnt think they would do anything like this
4223323 he loves that car this is actually the longest it has sat in the drive
4223324 this is the most ridiculous prank i have ever seen in my life
4223325 everybody walking past has stopped and stared and they all think its hilarious

4223700 i believe that the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness
4223701 generally speaking one begins by identifying those factors which lead to happiness and those factors which lead to suffering having done this one then sets about gradually eliminating those factors which lead to suffering and cultivating those which lead to happiness that is the way
4223702 put others first you yourself come next this works even from a selfish viewpoint let me explain how this is possible you want happiness and do not want suffering and if you show other people kindness love and respect they will respond in kind this way your happiness will increase if you show other people anger and hatred they will show you the same and you will lose your own happiness so i say if you are selfish you should be wisely selfish ordinary selfishness focuses only on your own needs but if you are wisely selfish you will treat others just as well as you treat those close to you ultimately this strategy will produce more satisfaction more happiness so even from a selfish viewpoint you get better results by respecting others serving others and reducing self centredness

4223977 im still here tweeting so obviously im not narked off enough to leave altogether
4223978 too much of a downgrade but at least i have an iphone now
4223979 the end of sms is a blow but wont be fatal now the patchy service has improved

4224020 there has been a sufficient amount of pessimism to warrant a short term rally
4224021 money is on the side line waiting to move in
4224022 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4224023 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4224024 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4224025 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4224026 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

4224062 can no longer be our partner it would be better if he went
4224063 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4224064 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4224065 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4224066 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4224067 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4224068 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4224069 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4224070 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4224071 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4224072 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4224073 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4224074 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4224075 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4224076 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4224077 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4224078 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4224079 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4224080 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4224081 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4224082 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4224083 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4224084 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4224085 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4224086 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4224087 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4224088 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4224089 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4224090 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4224091 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4224092 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4224093 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4224094 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4224095 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4224096 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4224097 who are open to doing something on the production side
4224098 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4224099 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4224100 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4224101 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4224102 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4224103 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4224104 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4224105 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4224106 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4224107 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4224108 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4224109 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
4224110 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
4224111 it is a much more common scenario today that it would have been even five years ago
4224112 in my opinion its an open and shut case they dont have irreversibility and they dont have death
4224113 as difficult as that was to hear this opportunity provided us with a ray of hope
4224114 at that point zachary was so sick we did have him at home but we knew it wasnt much longer
4224115 hes just a crazy little kid who loves to play and swim and throw rocks
4224116 addison did only live three days in this world but because of this she lives on
4224117 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4224118 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4224119 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4224120 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4224121 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4224122 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4224123 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4224124 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4224125 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4224126 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4224127 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4224128 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4224129 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4224130 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4224131 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4224132 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4224133 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4224134 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4224135 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4224136 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4224137 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4224138 the democratic party is a party of inclusion we respect the individual conscience of each american on this difficult issue and we welcome all our members to participate at every level of our party
4224139 strongly and unequivocally supports roe vs wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
4224140 also strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
4224141 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4224142 i do think that those who diminish the moral elements of the decision arent expressing the full reality of it
4224143 i wanted to keep the pain to myself son but now it cuts straight through me do you understand it cuts straight through me

4224146 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4224147 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue
4224148 we know that greek drama was theater for combat veterans by combat veterans

4224151 the war came home with my husband all four times
4224152 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4224153 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4224154 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4224155 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4224156 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4224157 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4224158 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4224159 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4224160 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4224161 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4224162 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4224163 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4224164 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

4224294 as a proof of this at or near the close of the harvest of 1780 my father john sherrard being at the time a member of the widow paulls family making his home there was an assistant hand in helping to cut down the harvest on paulls farm father sent charles may who was an orphan boy raised up in paulls family and at the time nearly a young man privately to spy out and report how near samuel works harvest hands were to finishing the cutting of the harvest charles went and upon his return he reported that unless something extra was done in the way of reaping in paulls grain field samuel works hands would have the brag and boast of having beaten us this time to accomplish the object and turn the brag and boast in favor of paulls reapers father and charles may the bound boy consulted together after supper and after the other reapers had left they two agreed to go back to the field and reap all night the moon being near its full gave them light all night long they took with them some whiskey an indispensible article at least it was thought to be so in harvest time and indeed by many in these old times it was thought to be a useful article at all times they also took with them some food to sustain nature and to enable them to perform the work they had undertaken and which they did manfully perform by reaping all night by moon light when the other hands collected in the morning it became an easy task to reap out what father and young charles may had left and it was by their labor through the night that they got the brag and the honor of having finished the reaping of the harvest on the paull farm several hours before they had finished cutting the harvest on samuel works farm thus ended with a hurrah the cutting of the harvest of 1780 on the paull farm this is the only instance i have ever known or heard of in a long life of near eighty years of two men having employed themselves reaping all night by moon light and just for no other purpose than to have it to boast of that they had cut down the harvest on paulls land first
4224295 the rabale had raised what they caled a liberty pole
4224296 the magistrates have sent for the men the very same that erected the pole and i had the pleasure of seeing them on saturday evening cut it down and with the same waggon that brought it into town they were obliged to draw the remains of it out of town again the circumstance was mortifying and they behaved very well they seem very penitent and no person offered them any insult
4224297 during this volcanic period colonel james paull was sheriff of fayette county than whom a braver nor truer man never held that office anywhere he was a decided friend of the government yet because under the advice of his counsel he declined to subject himself to an action for false imprisonment by executing a defective warrant for the arrest of some of his neighbors accused of being concerned in one of the attacks upon the house of wells he was indicted in the united states court at philadelphia what had the courts of the united states to do with the official duties of sheriffs the indictment was not prosecuted
4224298 i remember my mother when i was two years old took me in her arms dressed in a little petticoat or frock such as children of that age in olden times were dressed in and next she put on a little sun bonnet and carried me up a little way above the house to where father had been employed making beds ready for the sowing of seeds mother sat me down in a little alley between two beds there to divert myself by playing among the fresh dirt it was not long after mother did this that col james paull made his appearance going on a hunting excursion up into the mountain or that part of it known as laurel hill where yet lingered and could sometimes be found 77 years ago some remnant of the bear deer or wild turkey colonel paull stopped opposite where father and mother were at work and began to converse setting the butt of his gun on the ground holding the other end in his hand and to this hour i never remember a word that passed between father and colonel paull but my attention was attracted to the strange man that i never had seen before and to his gun and strange dress for he had on long green leggins the like of which i had never seen before all these strong attractions took my young attention and also fixed it strongly on my young memory i have often thought since of that period that if colonel paull had not come along and stopped and stood and conversed as he did until i got a fair view of him his gun and dress that it is most likely i should not have remembered anything about mother carrying me out into the garden that day col paull frequently took to the mountain region to hunt while we occupied the mountain farm which was until i was near ten years old i remember i was three years old before i was allowed to wear trousers the first pair of which i was very proud
4224299 substitutes employed by the sheriffs of the different counties of pennsylvania to do the duty of hangman were but little thought of and were generally held in less estimation than common chimney sweeps or tinkers so much so was this the case that they became outcasts and were shunned by the neighboring community so much so that the legislatures of different states passed laws making it obligatory that the sheriff of any county where capital punishment must be inflicted should be the executioner and i have not heard of any substitute since these laws were passed more than half a century ago i was present when old crawford was hanged near washington washington county pa for shooting his son henry he was hung on the 22nd of february 1823 and i remember that mr officer of that county performed his duty as required by law for when all things were adjusted and the drop on which old crawford stood must fall the sheriff shook hands with old crawford then he tied crawfords hands behind him and hastily drew the cap over his eyes and face the sheriff then wheeled off the drop picked up a hand ax and at one small stroke cut the rope and the drop fell the sheriff then hastily stepped down the stairs from the platform and paid no more attention till 39 minutes had expired during which time crawford hung and he was dead dead in less than 10 minutes of the 39 the last act of the sheriff mr officer was to cut the culprit down and lay him in a coffin the sheriff had provided he then delivered it to the friends of the deceased and they drove it home on a sled and buried it
4224300 but to return to the traveling man spoken of heretofore after looking on for a short time and seeing the men drinking whiskey to keep them warm and saw that it had a greater tendency to make them chilly he remarked to colonel paull whose presence was necessary to encourage the men to persevere in getting the iron out of the river before it would be covered up with sand and gravel that the men could not stand the cold by drinking whiskey which had the tendency instead of keeping them warm it made them the more chilly quite opposite in effect of what was intended if you will take my advice said the traveling man you will send out among the farmers of the neighborhood and collect a quantity of sweet milk put on the fire an eighteen gallon sugar kettle and fill it with sweet milk bring it to boil then stir in a small portion of flour so as to lithe it as the scotch would say not quite the consistency of gruel then let the men drink a tin cup full each man and drink it down as warm as they can and i will warrant your men will stand the cold four times longer on a tin cup full of this prepared milk than they can by using so much whiskey the milk was prepared and the iron was got out
4224301 here i struck a fire the first one i had indulged in during my journey and lodged by it on the old indian camping ground the fire served to keep off the gnats and mosquitoes these insects being very numerous in the vicinity of the tuscarawa river at this season of the year the staves of the old barrels and kegs rendered good service for fuel and for fire i ran a great risk in kindling a fire in the indian country as the indians might have seen the light of it or have been attracted to me by the signs of the smoke then again thinking that the indians might conclude it had been built by some of their own people i determined to leave it burn this was my fifth night out from the sandusky battle ground early the next morning june llth after resting easy on the indians whisky drinking ground expectancy for they had not heard of me and believed that i had been killed or taken prisoner as your father could give no information concerning me after he had roused me from sleep on the battleground the night of the retreat as before stated

4224306 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but he who does the will of my father who is in heaven

4224308 and then i will declare to them i never knew you depart from me you who practice lawlessness
4224309 therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock
4224310 and the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and slammed against that house and
4224311 everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand

4224599 looking at the race i would see new approach as the main opposition but im very happy that there is every chance we will get some ease in the ground which just might make all the difference to our horse
4224600 the governor presents this bond as a forward thinking comprehensive solution but in reality its the same old thing another version of past proposals to build more dams put in a peripheral canal and bail out corporate agribusiness
4224601 california has to put its own house in order before asking us to support another bond
4224602 instead of committing to a cost effective statewide water conservation plan modeled on the advances pioneered in southern california this plan wastes billions of dollars on outdated technologies

4224607 we need funding for programs that help provide safe clean drinking water despite its huge price tag this bond doesnt deliver
4224608 fortunately we still have funding available from a prior water bond to address urgent needs across the state rather than rush into another billion dollar bond this year were supporting passage of sb 1xx perata machado and steinberg which would release 800 million dollars in unspent funds from proposition 84 passed in 2006

4224727 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4224728 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research
4224729 basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
4224730 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
4224731 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4224732 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4224733 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening
4224734 the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the nest day when least expected
4224735 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
4224736 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion antihistimines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day

4224743 former apple inc general counsel nancy heinen has agreed to pay 2 2 million to settle options backdating charges the u s securities and exchange commission said on thursday
4224744 heinen also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years she settled the case without admitting or denying the charges the sec said
4224745 the charges relate to two large options grants to senior executives of apple including a grant to chief executive steve jobs of 7 5 million options in december 2001

4224748 apple the fast growing consumer electronics company was also investigated for irregularities over its accounting for stock options awarded to employees
4224749 the sec later cleared the company after it cooperated with the investigation but sued former apple chief financial officer fred anderson and heinen
4224750 heinen also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years she settled the case without admitting or denying the charges the sec said
4224751 hmmm well if you did nothing wrong being barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 5 years is a hell of a way to express that

4224772 whether he is impeached or not is not important from the indian point of view it is for the people of pakistan to decide but it leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on the pak afghan border but clearly on our side of the border too
4224773 i condemn this act of human rights violation there is no doubt that every pakistani is with their brothers and sisters in kashmir on this occasion i have no doubt that kashmir beats in the heart of every pakistani and that kashmir runs through pakistans veins therefore every pakistani is with the people of kashmir

4224778 suitable directives to e amp p operators for reimbursement of service tax
4224779 e amp p operators like ongc who have charter hired offshore supply vessels osvs have declined to reimburse the service tax on the basis of their own interpretation
4224780 indian osvs owners are unable to participate in any tender of e amp p operators because they have to factor the service tax component too in their quote with the result the rate quoted by indian owners are bound to be on higher side as compared to foreign vessel owners who do not have to pay service tax at all

4224916 because you have not listened to my words 9 i will summon all the peoples of the north and my servant nebuchadnezzar king of babylon
4224917 and i will bring them against this land and its inhabitants and against all the surrounding nations
4224918 but when the seventy years are fulfilled i will punish the king of babylon and his nation the land of the babylonians for their guilt
4224919 and will make it desolate forever 13 i will bring upon that land all the things i have spoken against it all that are written in this book and prophesied by jeremiah against all the nations 14 they themselves will be enslaved by many nations and great kings i will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands

4224922 if however any nation or kingdom will not serve nebuchadnezzar king of babylon or bow its neck under his yoke i will punish that nation with the sword famine and plague declares the lord until i destroy it by his hand
4224923 bow your neck under the yoke of the king of babylon serve him and his people and you will live
4224924 this is what the lord says do not listen to the prophets who say very soon now the articles from the lords house will be brought back from babylon
4224925 this is what the lord says in the same way will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon off the neck of all the nations within two years
4224926 go and tell hananiah this is what the lord says you have broken a wooden yoke but in its place you will get a yoke of iron
4224927 build houses and settle down plant gardens and eat what they produce 6 marry and have sons and daughters find wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage so that they too may have sons and daughters increase in number there do not decrease 7 also seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which i have carried you into exile pray to the lord for it because if it prospers you too will prosper
4224928 do not let the prophets and diviners among you deceive you do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to have 9 they are prophesying lies to you in my name i have not sent them
4224929 when seventy years are completed for babylon i will come to you and fulfill my gracious promise to bring you back to this place 11 for i know the plans i have for you
4224930 plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future 12 then you will call upon me and come and pray to me and i will listen to you 13 you will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart 14 i will be found by you
4224931 and will bring you back from captivity i will gather you from all the nations and places where i have banished you

4224933 the lord has raised up prophets for us in babylon
4224934 i will send the sword famine and plague against them and i will make them like poor figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten 18 i will pursue them with the sword famine and plague and will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth and an object of cursing and horror of scorn and reproach among all the nations where i drive them 19 for they have not listened to my words
4224935 words that i sent to them again and again by my servants the prophets and you exiles have not listened either
4224936 i will hand them over to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and he will put them to death before your very eyes 22 because of them all the exiles from judah who are in babylon will use this curse the lord treat you like zedekiah and ahab whom the king of babylon burned in the fire 23 for they have done outrageous things in israel they have committed adultery with their neighbors wives and in my name have spoken lies which i did not tell them to do i know it and am a witness to it
4224937 inspiration for a new business can hit you at any moment
4224938 the secret lies in being able to harness that idea and quickly bring it to fruition in a cost effective manner
4224939 many budding entrepreneurs get too caught up with the massive amount of detail involved in creating a burgeoning companys infrastructure rather than focusing on the business itself
4224940 i advocate outsourcing the basics to those that specialize in this to be successful in this tough economic climate you need to focus 100 percent of your attention on your business model and customers
4224941 with streetsmart we were literally up and running with our twistbox branded email and everything in a matter of hours
4224942 and the best part was that we now had a sophisticated backbone upon which to build our business for less than most people spend on coffee in a month
4224943 when i first started building companies i looked far and wide at the various options out there and found that there is no better choice today in the marketplace than infostreets streetsmart when you compare service and cost infostreet is the perfect solution for mid to small sized businesses that want the capabilities of a big firm but dont have excess capital to just spend spend spend you would have to dedicate large sums to most other offerings to get the type of services that streetsmart offers us today all from one web based platform

4224949 san pedro was the only provincial capital in the country that didnt have a paved highway to asuncion

4224952 since june senators obama and clinton have been working together to ensure a democratic victory this november
4224953 they are both committed to winning back the white house and to ensuring that the voices of all 35m people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver to honour and celebrate these voices and votes both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4224954 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4224955 the obama campaign has made no significant headway among former clinton backers over the past two months the voting preferences of clintons supporters are virtually identical to earlier polls in june and july

4224961 most likely peltzs stake is a nonissue and will lead to no changes i certainly dont buy that its a good reason for the stock to add more than half a billion dollars to its market cap in a single day
4224962 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
4224963 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water

4224967 as a spurs supporter of no half measure i will continue to support jol hughton the squad and the entire club to the best of my ability and at all times
4224968 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
4224969 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
4224970 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
4224971 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
4224972 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
4224973 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
4224974 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
4224975 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
4224976 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him
4224977 when youve finished playing football young man which is going to be very soon i feel youll make a very good security guard
4224978 if someone wants to give you a bum steer on who were after then so be it if you want to know ask me because i have a list of players we want and robbie keane isnt on it
4224979 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
4224980 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
4224981 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
4224982 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
4224983 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
4224984 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad

4224989 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
4224990 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
4224991 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
4224992 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
4224993 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
4224994 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
4224995 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

4224997 i had a gun in my carrying case which was given to me by a marvelous engraver
4224998 last year at the telethon of 07 he presented me with this gorgeous gift i put it in that traveling case and i hadnt traveled since that telethon

4225000 ok i tried to run to the gym workout and run back well about a mile in my lower back started to flare up real bad i was thinking that there was no way in uzbekistan that i was going to be able to do this so i walk jog walked the rest of the way to the gym lifted and realized how freaking hard it is to jog back home after i walked like a mile and had a mile and a half left i decided to jog and see how far i got well i think i started off too fast the first time or maybe just stretched my back out because i made it the whole way home in about 12 mins little to no back pain so day one was inconclusive wednesday is day two as i will hopefully be able to do the full 2 5 miles to and then back from the gym if that works out ill go for 5 on friday
4225001 the efficiency of the boiler is about 94 percent whereas what we are replacing here is about 60 percent

4225004 i found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mothers race
4225005 i ceased to advertise my mothers race at the age of 12 or 13 when i began to suspect that by doing so i was ingratiating myself to whites
4225006 tell me who your friend is and i will tell you who you are
4225007 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country
4225008 not what they want to hear but the truths they need to hear

4225013 where were both dancing and were naked and we both have prosthetic penises
4225014 we had a lot of good people go out the door today
4225015 as with most other u s boat makers these brands have been doing their best to confront a weak domestic marine industry
4225016 we have done so by growing sales outside of the u s better controlling costs and taking a number of other measures
4225017 unfortunately these efforts have not totally mitigated the reduced sales activity being experienced in the u
4225018 with a responsibility to ensure the financial strength and equity of these brands we have adjusted production rates downward at our manufacturing facilities unfortunately this production adjustment dictates a necessary and accompanying reduction of employment
4225019 while we regret having to take these actions we recognize the need for effective pipeline management to safeguard the financial health of both our brands and our dealer network
4225020 this decision is no reflection upon our work force but the result of current economic realities and just as importantly our need to reflect market demand going forward with a leaner more efficient organization
4225021 the company has been doing a number of things to counteract the weakness in the domestic market but unfortunately it was not enough these job losses are not a furlough not temporary these positions are permanently eliminated

4225027 un enfoque tradicional tambi n fracasado de la polarizaci n gobierno y oposici n en donde solamente nos ocupemos de la pol tica y descalificar la propuesta del gobierno y polarizar yo creo que ese enfoque nos podr llevar al fracaso
4225028 el segundo enfoque que quiero proponer es el que tiene que ver con caracas y su gente que tenga que ver con los problemas de todos los caraque os caracas ciudad para la vida que tiene una serie de elementos de la seguridad ciudadana los espacios p blicos la salud la educaci n una caracas que pueda estar en permanente contacto con la vida

4225044 some of the very best barbecue can be found at church school and vfw fundraisers
4225045 now it is time to turn our attention to barbecue restaurants that add a touch of tomato to their sauces its called lexington style or western barbecue
4225046 crear unas milicias en la fuerza armada es un exabrupto porque ser como el extinto l der iraqu saddam hussein que ten a una guardia republicana que le respond a a l aqu est pasando lo mismo
4225047 habr dos fuerzas armadas una profesional y otra que estar a la orden del presidente para defender la revoluci n bolivariana y que quieren introducir de manera fraudulenta
4225048 ellos pueden pedir ellos tienen el deber de pedirlo pero no es la instancia no es la asamblea nacional si ellos quieren anular alguna ley acudan al tribunal supremo
4225049 esa solicitud fue pasada a nuestros consultores jur dicos para definir a cu les organismos nos vamos a dirigir y para nosotros lo preocupante es el llamado al desconocimiento de las leyes y eso lo vamos a denunciar a los organismos competentes

4225054 hoy es la ltima sesi n no obstante es este viernes cuando finaliza el per odo legislativo reglamentariamente
4225055 aqu hay una situaci n muy grave el problema central es esta atribuci n de la fuerza armanda

4225065 given the impacts that other gaming operators have felt we are very proud to report that seneca gaming corp has produced a double digit increase in net revenues for the second consecutive quarter
4225066 as we move forward we will continue to keep a close eye on the economic conditions that are facing the entire country and operate our three casino properties in the most efficient manner while maintaining the value and the level of service and excitement that our patrons have come to expect from seneca gaming corp
4225067 i cherish the great people i worked with at apple and am proud of my contributions to its historic turnaround and current success
4225068 with this lawsuit behind me i look forward to addressing the greater challenges of social justice and economic disparity
4225069 an admission but rather a recognition that life is short
4225070 we have finally got understanding of our point of view that poland being a crucial partner in nato and an important friend and ally of the united states must also be safe
4225071 the significant increase in property values across the state has provided local government with a windfall of property tax revenue
4225072 rather than returning this windfall revenue to florida taxpayers they have chosen to spend this money at a rate faster than a taxpayers ability to pay
4225073 my one great talent lies in making those who wrong me suffer horribly
4225074 most shootings on the streets in cities across the country are committed with illegal guns
4225075 by shifting our resources and focus there we can prevent a lot of crime and prevent a lot of shootings that is our whole m o
4225076 guns move in and out of states across state lines very easily
4225077 the issue is where do the guns come from too many of our young people have access to guns too many people are able to buy guns
4225078 texas and florida places where it may put elected officials in danger for saying what is right
4225079 created a new class of firearms sellers known as hobbyists
4225080 it allows people in the business sell guns without requiring background checks
4225081 an education vehicle for people to find out how dangerous it is to have guns in their homes
4225082 a lot of it was mothers girlfriends grandmothers younger brothers who knew where guns were and wanted a safe legal way to get rid of them
4225083 she just felt likeminded she connected with a bunch of us from the original citizens for safety and we all began working together
4225084 wont even hold a hearing on gun shows and he knows what guns are doing in detroit
4225085 we could build a campaign around them and squeeze other dealers
4225086 help us in our community get together and organize so that we can make a difference someone is putting guns in the hands of our babies
4225087 we are focused on keeping guns out of the hands of criminals not keeping guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens
4225088 i think the supreme court decision allows for common sense policies to keep guns out of the hands of kids criminals and the mentally ill
4225089 in the future you might want to put a little disclaimer on that
4225090 it was great to see everyone come together with the same focus and the same goals in mind
4225091 will have to choose to support either a virtual project or a real partnership on issues that truly demand collective actions
4225092 transfers of manpower and resources including activation and reassignment of units shall be halted
4225093 we are taking a pause on standing up the command so we can insure were going about it the right way
4225094 the number of properties that have been foreclosed on by the banks and still havent sold is the highest weve ever seen
4225095 we will protect our land and territorial waters with all our might
4225096 we routinely rotate deployed naval forces in the uscentcom area of responsibility one of which is the persian gulf
4225097 as a matter of policy we do not discuss current or future ships movements
4225098 prohibiting the export to iran of all refined petroleum products imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons vehicles ships planes trains and cargo entering or departing iran
4225099 this resolution house resolution 362 is a virtual war resolution it is the declaration of tremendous sanctions and boycotts and embargoes on the iranians it is very very severe
4225100 the fear is they say maybe some day iran is going to get a nuclear weapon even though our own cias national intelligence estimate has said that the iranians have not been working on a nuclear weapon since 2003
4225101 the islamic revolution guards corps recently tested a naval weapon which is definitely capable of sending any warship within a distance of 300 km to the bottom of the sea
4225102 i can tell you that reports of an alleged naval blockade of iran are false
4225103 in the 21st century men dont cheat on their wives
4225104 from our conversations with our international counterparts in new york milan and paris it has become clear that they do not recognize the need for an international health certificate
4225105 the decline of palestinian christians religious cultural and strategic implications
4225106 it was really the political and economic situation that leads to their emigration
4225107 if israel does not do its homework with its palestinian neighbors it will still have a problem
4225108 vision for peace since israel only has a vision for security

4225125 know where youre going and what youll be doing and that youll have the support and resources and training you need
4225126 i think some people are afraid of heights but if you set very high goals even if you dont reach them youll be successful
4225127 theres a saying you cant dance at two weddings at once
4225128 i thought it was important to jump in quickly and not try to juggle two careers
4225129 in my previous job i had to explain and promote what i was selling
4225130 its an opportunity to build stronger relationships than i could selling floors and its more meaningful
4225131 it gives you energy to go out and meet people and give them one small idea that helps them
4225132 obama is a muslim thats why we call him barack osama
4225133 i dont vote on a nigger whos a muslim on top

4225135 dinner one pound of pasta an entire pizza more energy drinks
4225136 body wont recover the muscles will not recover there will not be adequate energy stored for him to compete in the next event
4225137 it appears that when it comes to tax cuts the courts have taken some extreme liberties in how theyre deciding
4225138 there have been plenty of amendments that didnt pay for themselves
4225139 sellers of food products do not attract the same kind of attention as purveyors of drugs or tobacco they should
4225140 entendemos al gobierno georgiano como un proyecto especial de estados unidos pero un d a washington tendr que elegir entre defender su prestigio en un proyecto virtual o establecer una sociedad m s estrat gica

4225143 so i have been so tempted to try out project 365 but at the same time would like it to be more than just a bunch of random photos and would like it to feel ok if i just missed a day or two and not have to drop out completely because of it
4225144 theres nothing like that in the world nothing at all he accelerates so fast coming off some of those turns the front wheel comes right off the ground and coming up the front straightaway it was hard to keep my head down its so fast
4225145 we were leaning over a whole lot and it seemed real real fast im not used to motorcycles so it was a totally different feel out on the racetrack than in a car ive done some car racing ive gone that fast before but never like that this is totally different
4225146 that was probably one of the coolest things ive gotten to do since ive started working at speed channel ive done ridealongs in nascar the indycar stuff but this is by far the coolest ridealong experience ive had yet its more intimate with the track the open air the shifting your weight and leaning in youre doing a lot of the work not the machine doing all the work
4225147 i was ive liked watching the ama stuff but riding being able to experience this is definitely a lot better this is the way to go
4225148 it was fun it was fun it was fun i was scared it wasnt going to be fast enough whooo it was totally awesome i didnt realize you guys went that fast on tv it doesnt seem like youre going that fast but when youre out there youre like holy sheeesh then he touched his knee down a couple of times it was really cool
4225149 i say dont look at your debt more than one hour a week that hour is when you pay bills and its when you cry moan and feel bad if you need to the rest of the time you need to be proactive thinking about positive ways to save money be happy about the fact that youre doing everything you can and go to sleep at night
4225150 what we know is that isolation kills which means it drives up stress and community or being with other people in disclosure and telling the truth is a healing balm
4225151 the key factor right now especially with all the trouble in the economy is that you have to remain positive and optimistic keep an upbeat attitude

4225159 considero que los cambios que se han dado en la universidad son para bien para convertir a la udlap en una de las mejores en el pa s pero en estos momentos no se contempla el cierre de la escuela la salida de unos de sus alumnos como andrew almaz n no afecta al contrario esos movimientos fueron al parecer para reducir los gastos

4225161 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head back and saw big flames

4225167 they say it should be only a few weeks now then ill get my license from the district police and ill be back in business
4225168 in this century in this city of all cities we must reject the cold war mind set of the past and resolve to work with russia when we can to stand up for our values when we must and to seek a partnership that extends across this entire continent
4225169 it remains the case that a level headed policy is the one that most helps people in the region
4225170 we must criticize what needs to be criticized and we have done this in the past including with clear words when necessary towards russia with regard to russian bombing of georgia and the presence of russian troops in georgia proper
4225171 we should also pursue a policy which is sensible and realistic
4225172 if the eu really wants to play a stronger role in the region if the eu wants to help in the stabilization of a crisis hit region then the lines of communication must be kept open to tbilisi and moscow
4225173 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4225174 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4225175 the first is that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks the other is that it is totally unacceptable to question the legitimacy of the democratically elected georgian government
4225176 merkel will try to convince medvedev to move toward a ceasefire accept a monitoring mission of the osce and hopefully also be open to a stabilizing international peace force in the region
4225177 i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russias future behavior

4225276 our second quarter performance was disappointing as we generated less than planned revenue and more than planned operating losses several factors contributed to our second quarter operating performance revenue growth was constrained due to limitations in production resulting from the following factors the temporary shutdown of our new sevoflurane line for scheduled cleaning and maintenance delays in receipts of raw materials prior to our may closing of the 40 million in new financing and the disc rupture of one of our production reactors our operating margins were negatively impacted by the lack of revenue and production growth as well the impact of certain charges to establish operating reserves for potentially uncollectible receivables and to set up an obsolescence reserve for our device inventory
4225277 our second quarter performance was below management expectations based on factors discussed above but we clearly understand what happened and what must be done to significantly improve our performance going forward our senior management team had several priorities for the second quarter which were accomplished but are not yet reflected in our operating performance we successfully refinanced the business in april in a very difficult credit market and reestablished sound relationships with our vendors the latter consumed significant senior management time and attention in may and june we focused on improving output and efficiencies in our bethlehem plant continued to secure growth in international sales and registrations initiated a continuing rationalization of our business and implemented sound cash management practices all of the latter actions are continuing and will deliver improvements in our revenue growth and profitability in the near term

4225395 we connected the dots to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
4225396 during the dry season in the amazon the only aerosols of any magnitude are from smoke emerging from human initiated fires
4225397 scientists have observed instances where increases or decreases in the amount of these tiny particles have increased and decreased cloud cover in different places and times
4225398 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
4225399 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
4225400 this improved understanding leads to prediction and prediction can help us plan and perhaps prevent some of the potential consequences of putting aerosols from human activity into the atmosphere
4225401 as wed expected in applying our model increased smoke from the fires created clouds rife with a more pronounced radiative effect rich with human caused aerosols that absorbed sunlight warmed the local atmosphere and blocked evaporation this led to reduced cloud cover over the amazon
4225402 and its encouraging to know the science behind our model should stand no matter the region
4225403 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
4225404 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4225405 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
4225406 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
4225407 i dont know but i sure dont like those who ask that question
4225408 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4225409 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
4225410 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4225411 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
4225412 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
4225413 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
4225414 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
4225415 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
4225416 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
4225417 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
4225418 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
4225419 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
4225420 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
4225421 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
4225422 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
4225423 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
4225424 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
4225425 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
4225426 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
4225427 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
4225428 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
4225429 the right information has to be given to the people
4225430 yang peiyi missed out on selection to appear at the ceremony because of her external appearance it was for the national interest
4225431 i think there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic director picked the best voice and the best performer
4225432 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great
4225433 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
4225434 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
4225435 i dont agree with the decision because they are kids and it may scar them for life
4225436 i think the girl with the voice should have a chance to perform at the closing ceremonies it would be a great chance for her to redeem herself to the world
4225437 chens original interview was posted on beijing radios web site sunday night by tuesday the link was shut down the chinese government routinely blocks sites that are politically sensitive or that could cause embarrassment to the countrys communist rulers lin declined to answer when asked if peiyi should be included in the closing ceremony except to say that he was not the director he said his daughter was not doing any rehearsals and that he presumed she would not be involved in the closing ceremony
4225438 according to reports lin miaoke the cute seven year old who sang the national anthem was actually miming
4225439 according to reports lin miaoke the cute seven year old who sang the national anthem was actually miming
4225440 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4225441 according to reports lin miaoke the cute seven year old who sang the national anthem was actually miming
4225442 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4225443 according to reports lin miaoke the cute seven year old who sang the national anthem was actually miming
4225444 fisheries in flux how do we ensure our sustainable future
4225445 two key issues affecting fisheries sustainability are the reduction of bycatch the incidental harvest of non target species and the problem of plastic pollution in our marine environment
4225446 our booth will document work toward the design of halibut and salmon excluder devices for trawl nets as well as our nationally recognized efforts at marine debris cleanup
4225447 this is one of the ways communities really see how growth makes a difference in their tax revenue because the base jumps significantly
4225448 we know the water recharges about 35 000 acre feet a year and we believe that pumpage is approaching that at this point
4225449 so we need to go very cautiously into the future as far as our water goes and an additional 5 000 lots in the valley is not cautious
4225450 if done properly overall behavioral targeted advertising could prove quite valuable to consumers and could dramatically improve their online experiences while at the same time protecting their privacy
4225451 i think hell is being in the absence of purpose
4225452 when i had no purpose no direction i actually felt like i was living in hell
4225453 where people who have led bad lives and die without being sorry are eternally punished
4225454 in a pluralistic post modern world students are having a more difficult time with the idea of people going to hell forever because they didnt believe the right thing
4225455 thats the biggest question out there right now would god send someone to hell if they were someone as good as me but didnt believe what i believe
4225456 ive noticed in the last five years how that view is making inroads even in conservative churches whereas five years ago it wasnt even uttered or discussed
4225457 they believe everyone has an equal chance at this life and the next
4225458 life after death a history of the afterlife in western religion
4225459 and the smoke of their torment rises for ever and ever
4225460 the whole person is suffering probably in utter hopelessness just being absent from god and goodness
4225461 the lord gives you a choice of whether or not you want to spend eternity separated from him or in love and comfort and peace
4225462 most of the problems out here like drugs its the devils influence
4225463 i have to show trust in god and his mercy all the time always satan is circling and trying to misguide me
4225464 remains atop the hot 100 airplay chart making this one of the rare times in which an artist simultaneously dominates the regular hot 100 and the hot 100 airplay chart with different songs
4225465 i think that presidents deserve to be questioned maybe irreverently most of the time to bring em down a size
4225466 access to a president doesnt mean youre gonna get the truth
4225467 i could see president kennedy was struggling so finally i got up and said thank you mr president i got him off the hook
4225468 youll see her doing features soundtracks for the movies albums and merchandising like you would not believe
4225469 they snatched her up took her off the market and said well figure it out
4225470 i read the script and the very human story and the very core of this film spoke to me very clearly
4225471 this is a departure from the very big hollywood productions
4225472 well yea of course its tied down its an airship
4225473 dont sit on the naked singularity that powers this sim
4225474 las rdenes de disparar en el acto suponen una clara violaci n del derecho a la vida y de las normas internacionales sobre aplicaci n de la ley
4225475 la inestabilidad de la situaci n de jammu y cachemira exige m s sensibilidad por parte de las autoridades no una orden de disparar en el acto
4225476 las autoridades indias deben llevar a cabo investigaciones y poner a disposici n judicial tanto a los polic as como a los manifestantes de una forma r pida transparente y justa para suavizar la tensi n entre las comunidades religiosas
4225477 herr von karajan jam s dirigir en bayreuth mientras yo viva
4225478 i am in between that period too old for girlfriend roles and way too young for grandma roles its a tough time
4225479 its her one last vice and she knows that her kids hate her doing it too
4225480 she needed drastic action and the media focused on that in the end
4225481 she should be in hospital not alone in a sleazy bar
4225482 well of course we would all aspire to bring up children the way ms osbourne has was it nursery or rehab she sent them too
4225483 i love all the royal stuff and so does she we want to explore together it will be fun
4225484 we have a ban on tv during the day while we both study and then at night we much prefer a quiet dinner by the bay and then a little music that is the whole point of a holiday one thinks
4225485 i am way too much of a wimp to take that pain but i am fascinated by the art of it all so maybe one day
4225486 knows about this as we have had to ask friends for advice etc but as she has not personally sat for us its all from pictures so its harder than normal
4225487 i much prefer american idol as its less cruel than the brit version and it focuses on the positive rather than the negative
4225488 i still get nervous at huge events and even playing at l a galaxy but its great to have that it proves there is still a fire there
4225489 whatever i get to do its a moment in history and with my wife and children at my side i will be honored and blessed
4225490 i figure people may take me seriously as an actor after that i need to prove myself
4225491 i serve posh in there all the time and i am looking to expand across europe too its a dream job
4225492 she has such a torrid life i will be shocked having to do some of those things
4225493 highlight of my year so far meeting david beckham without a doubt
4225494 she may be gone but is still the shining star within the royal family and her cards are reprinted all the time the most popular image is in fact her last few pictures than fans really go for
4225495 it will feature all aspects of his 60 years including a glowing tribute to his first marriage to diana of course
4225496 will be based on a percentage deal which means she has to drag in the crowd to get the money
4225497 always been close to her and they met up on a regular basis
4225498 fergie will now be welcomed back into the fold at all royal levels and this is to do with her daughters
4225499 you know i get more love in the u s and i am thrilled with that more to be honest
4225500 we are urging this man or anyone who can identify him to get in touch as we believe he may be a crucial witness to this attack
4225501 someone out there saw something that night someone knows who this man is and we need them to contact us
4225502 we have a dedicated team of over 30 detectives investigating these attacks from a major incident room in workington and we are doing everything we can to trace whoever is responsible
4225503 the present state of the construction industry continues to negatively impact our operating results and provide a challenging environment for our business operations while sales and losses have improved from the first quarter of 2008 we expect current industry conditions will remain for a period of time and as a result will continue to search for additional expense reduction opportunities to better manage our cost structure we regularly evaluate the performance of each of our facilities as we look to improve or close unprofitable locations we expect the actions previously taken by management and ongoing reductions will also benefit future periods and better position the company when the construction market rebounds
4225504 our revenues increased again this quarter due to the performance of our atiam business which on a year to date basis represents 20 of our revenues
4225505 atiams flagship software product inspro continues to be well received by insurance carriers and third party administrators both on a licensed and application service provider basis we have also been successful in assisting clients in converting their current systems to inspro and customizing the functionality of the inspro product to further support their needs
4225506 in addition for the first time this quarter we earned revenues relating to insurint tm our professional grade agent sales tool the use of our insurint tm platform by independent insurance agents to market and sell health insurance and related products is an important endorsement of our proprietary technology
4225507 these financial results represent the first steps in restructuring our operations as we focus more resources on commercializing the companys technology portfolio while implementing strategic cost reduction initiatives to increase operating efficiency
4225508 we continue to be encouraged by the positive reception to the verigene system in the market there is pent up demand for new system placements and cartridge volume in anticipation of continued menu expansion in the second quarter our business was impacted by the delay in getting the cystic fibrosis assay into the market the cystic fibrosis assay is now in final stages of clinical trials and we anticipate filing with the fda soon
4225509 while we are disappointed with the time it has taken so far in getting our cystic fibrosis assay to the market and accelerating placements of the verigene system this and other tests we anticipate delivering over the next few quarters represent a market opportunity in excess of 1 billion we believe this expanded menu and the value proposition of each assay will drive accelerated market penetration
4225510 one of the unique aspects of our site is the wide range of products that are built tested and delivered to our customers for use on many different platforms with unique requirements and capabilities
4225511 no other provider of navigation and situational awareness products can address the challenges that so many of our customers are demanding
4225512 well continue to service campgrounds were still pumping toilets were still providing toilet paper that certainly falls under health and safety for the public
4225513 its not very often you get to say you beat the no 1 player in the world anytime but to do it at the olympics with usa on your chest im so proud to be part of this team
4225514 this is a critical time from a developing youth perspective to learn how to move enjoy activity be proactive with their health and build self esteem
4225515 there are sports if a child wants to be part of a team or can play well but when it comes to obesity and poor self image theres not much out there in the way of physical fitness
4225516 what well talk about includes what you can expect from kids
4225517 for example they wont always be capable of certain levels of flexibility because of growth spurts or they cant always catch a ball because maybe their hand eye co ordination isnt sufficiently developed
4225518 you cant apply adult based fitness to youth you put them on a treadmill and theyll be bored to tears
4225519 but you put a child outside for 15 or 20 minutes and theyll be jumping bouncing and running im trying to debunk the myth that everything is good for everybody
4225520 shes involved in sports and is extremely active plus nutrition is really important at our house
4225521 but shes going through a phase where shes a bit pudgy in places and some other kids are making fun i cant see how shed be helped by drawing attention to this problem
4225522 physical activity builds self esteem ask any athlete how they feel about themselves and they are very positive
4225523 activity helps create a strong sense of self that comes through movement and building a stronger mind body connection
4225524 the entire lift structure slides down with pink parking car parks get girly
4225525 a revitalized centennial pool together with the mainland common centre are excellent additions to the sport and recreation facilities currently in our province
4225526 both initiatives will provide nova scotians with exceptional venues to help them be more active
4225527 this project will provide an important facility to benefit athletes across the province and canada while generating important economic benefits for the halifax region
4225528 it is proposed that the forecasted loss for each year will be covered by the operational savings with the closure of northcliffe estimated at 330 000 in addition staff are budgeting 50 000 operating costs from capital in 2009 10 and 300 000 operating from capital in 2010 11
4225529 it takes a couple of years to get a new facility up and running and membership in place
4225530 people will be coming to train there and the training centre may attract from people from across the region they need to have a place to stay eat maybe do a little shopping
4225531 there has been a lot of growth in the suburbs in the last decade fairview clayton park timberlea tantallon we want recreational facilities to support the expansion not only will it be easier to attract businesses with good recreational facilities its a positive sign for hrm
4225532 it took awhile to secure the funding necessary and years of studies and consultation we can now can go back to the community and get comments and feedback
4225533 the main components are what the community identified back in 2005
4225534 we will be employing many people northcliffe pool will be closed and staff from there will go to the mainland commons centre there will be other staff and offices there as well
4225535 someone asked why not take the money and fix potholes there are all different departments and one of them is health and health care its important to get out there get exercise and participate health care is important there are costs to the system
4225536 the last three studies by hrm all indicated the requirement for a 50 metre pool in nova scotia
4225537 there isnt a facility in nova scotia where national events can be held there is the opportunity to take advantage of now and put in a 50 metre pool we feel the consulting report is flawed
4225538 weve been asking for six months unfortunately a lot of things the municipality does are under built
4225539 in terms of the economy holding national events and health and wellness would offset any of the other costs theyre being short sighted
4225540 there is room to build if the need is identified down the road
4225541 there is opportunity down the road for a 50 metre pool or one or two surface arenas it would be an additional 10 million to add a 50 metre pool to the project if the goal is to host national meets we have two pools the operating cost are very high for a 50 metre versus 25 metre and those costs are shouldered by the municipality
4225542 as usual were happy to present a new strong partner we know esea has a lot to offer to its community and of course were excited to be a part of it while supporting each others sk gaming is looking forward to a successful partnership cheers
4225543 from 2002 through 2007 i battled against sk at every major international tournament
4225544 i think of my own children and the other children in my community we all need to consider their safety when were on the road
4225545 the studies are conclusive that using your cellphone while driving is not safe
4225546 there is plenty of good evidence to clearly show that driver reaction time is reduced by cellphone use and the risk of accident is higher
4225547 i could count that many on prince albert road in an hour any weekday morning

4225549 we hold the district court erred in denying food lions motions for a directed verdict and reverse and vacate the district courts judgment because rodgers failed to show that food lion placed the foreign substance on the floor or knew or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known of its presence and failed to remove it food lion was entitled to a directed verdict for the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from is reversed the jury award vacated and judgment entered favoring food lion inc

4225552 ali obviously had no idea about director peter davys past
4225553 if she did know she never would have auditioned for him
4225554 so bad you dont even know and now its actually happening ive already been asked for my autograph and its just a really good feeling to have
4225555 hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4225556 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4225557 so what would i love to wear this fall and the vest is back woohoo
4225558 capsaicinoid content is measured in parts per million these parts per million are converted into scoville heat units the industry standard for measuring a peppers punch one part per million is equivalent to 15 scoville units bell peppers have a value of zero scoville units whereas habanero the hottest peppers register a blistering 200 000 to 300 000 pure capsaicin has a scoville heat unit score of 16 million
4225559 interlab variation for the original scoville scale could be as high as 50 however labs that run these procedures could generate reasonably repeatable results
4225560 scoville unit measurements cause errors due to build up of heat rapid taste fatigue increased taste threshold and poor reproducibility
4225561 the coefficient of error is 50 for the scoville method and less than 12 for the hplc method
4225562 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
4225563 it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4225564 we will support any decision made by the people of south ossetia and abkhazia
4225565 before georgias aggression talks with georgia were possible but now there will be no talks with georgia
4225566 i dont know how they are going to isolate us
4225567 i have heard threats that we are not going to be admitted to the world trade organization but we see clearly that nobody is going to admit us there anyway
4225568 theyre still pushing the view that open source products like the java application server geronimo or mule esb are just cheap the consequences of being an open source company
4225569 fact is that different types of open source products might require different approaches alfresco to my cisco and microsoft clash of the uc titans
4225570 i think that open source is absolutely vital to making this work because fundamentally what were talking about is breaking down the barriers between different systems
4225571 it takes a village how about a whole city how about 100 cities i enjoyed this item from linuxinsider about residents of felton creating wealth with free software
4225572 a report by the standish group indicates that adoption of open source has caused a drop in revenue to the proprietary open source vs proprietary intranet software part 1

4225582 dance shows always do well but it has to be adapted for trends working on tv
4225583 its quite a positive show theres not a lot meanness that may exist in other reality programming
4225584 for a lot of people it reminds them of the time when tv wasnt so hostile
4225585 our show was really more about watching the creativity happen and contestants learning the choreography in a different sub genre each week
4225586 dancers are dramatic and emotional and i think its really compelling to watch
4225587 what these shows have replaced is what we no longer have a large support for the arts
4225588 the government no longer supports the arts theyre not fed like they were
4225589 weve seen a big increase in interest since the shows went on air
4225590 weve done a lot of ballroom classes and choreographed dances for weddings dance is on the brain
4225591 of course some of these shows are not for the dance purist
4225592 but it has such a domino effect on dance and getting people to think about dance its really just fantastic
4225593 people know the difference they see how hard these dancers work and realize that its a skill
4225594 at the same time it may inspire them to learn something new

4225631 the industry has never seen anything like our new sage series before so it is vital we have the correct team in place from design to production to sales and distribution to bring this exciting new product to market
4225632 both todd and eric have an extensive history within the high end a v market and will play integral roles in making our new sage series architectural and freestanding speaker systems a success
4225633 todd is an industry veteran with a particular knowledge and appreciation of the needs and expectations of the custom installation dealer
4225634 jon herron wisdom audio v p sales and i both worked with todd at madrigal and i also worked with todd at kaleidescape since the three of us already shared a successful professional history jon and i knew todd shared our philosophy regarding the invaluable role of the dealer and their importance to wisdoms success in the ci channel

4225637 dealers often ask me how the training programs can reduce their installation time but our focus is to ensure that the installer is putting the unit in properly not necessarily quickly this reduces the amount of after installation maintenance calls
4225638 education reform and state government the role of tests expectations funding and failure

4225645 the crime of the supreme court since the 1930s so says this book has been its refusal to lock in the laissez faire constitutional philosophy that reigned supreme in the decades leading up to the new deal
4225646 interpretation of the general welfare clause is not inconsistent with original understanding because there was no clear understanding on that point during the founding
4225647 structure relates first to the internal relationship among the various provisions of the constitution and second to the overall design or framework of government that the constitution establishes
4225648 candidly and admirably concede that originalism is actually of little help in explaining their hostility to a number of cases on their list
4225649 it is the law that governs not the intent of the lawgiver
4225650 applying original intent begs several questions which drafters or ratifiers are authoritative how do we know their intent how are differing views among the drafters and ratifiers to be resolved
4225651 sinned by adopting an expansive view of the commerce power wickard was the key precedent for the decision upholding the constitutionality of the 1964 civil rights act the dirty dozen never faces up to that obvious problem
4225652 the authors seem to be arguing in simple consequentialist terms a case is badly decided if it has some bad effect in the real world
4225653 a case is badly decided if it has some bad effect
4225654 libertarianism which does not even begin to address the problem of private power
4225655 you still need a sorting theory when should judges while engaging defer and when should they act

4225661 who out there has more name recognition than i do and experience ive got so much damn experience that i almost retired
4225662 i would clearly be a helpful choice just think if that offer for the 25 million is still on the table we could use that for the campaign and even without that added cash flow i would help mccain carry mississippi for sure
4225663 and wisconsin also which is a swing state well on second thought maybe not wisconsin
4225664 treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4225665 this is about generating new revenue streams for musicians the record companies take a piece of the tour and the merchandise but they cant take a piece of this
4225666 i cant believe im entrusted with the legacy of the most famous words in the world
4225667 i realized i could help musicians generate new revenue without feeling like theyre selling out
4225668 its almost like shes giving a scholarship to these people who are being creative
4225669 it by itself is not going to save the music industry but its certainly a nice plus
4225670 no matter how successful youve been the business depends on continuing success
4225671 the instruments that schools have as part of the ksn weatherlab network powered by weatherbug are absolutely top notch accurate and reliable instruments that said sometimes variables like instrument placement can cause measurements to be different than surrounding areas and of course there are occasional times when a sensor goes bad and needs to be replaced we work hard to support all of our ksn weatherlab network school partners in properly placing their instruments and in maintaining them
4225672 its hard to think of anything more foreign to the principles of the democratic party or the whole american experience
4225673 far from liberating women abortion has become a lucrative industry exploiting young women beyond anything ever imagined
4225674 these are questions that rest uneasily on the conscience of todays democratic party
4225675 we can choose to extend once again the mantle of protection to all members of the human family including the unborn
4225676 because we believe in the privacy and equality of women we stand proudly for a womans right to choose consistent with roe v wade and regardless of her ability to pay we stand firmly against republican efforts to undermine that right at the same time we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives abortion should be safe legal and rare
4225677 no crooked table legs or ill fitted drawers i daresay ever came out of the carpenters shop in nazareth
4225678 oi world weve just resolved that whole global warming debate once amp for all
4225679 hundreds of scientists economists and public policy experts from around the world will gather on march 2 4 2008 at the marriott new york marquis hotel on manhattans time square to call attention to widespread dissent in the scientific community to the alleged
4225680 we dig all the same things and get ridiculously excited about whatever were working on we also throw fits whenever were told no by the man and sometimes to our detriment have a burned earth policy when it comes to doing a project the way we want fortunately we usually get the support needed to build our visions and madman atomic comics is a prime example of that image comics could not be more supportive in their backing me up with all my crazed paper dreams in madman atomic comics theyre just as jazzed as i am to invite darwyn and mutual pal and cool genius j bone on madman atomic comics 14
4225681 you dont seem the type to sit still for long
4225682 i almost wish we could go back to the days when we never heard their voices
4225683 there is something about the web that brings out the ego monster in everybody
4225684 in addition to being an author i am an avid pastry chef sca member foot fetishist
4225685 my plan was to play the fedex cup but i dont know if i have quite enough points to be safe
4225686 so i might have to go back and earn some more
4225687 speaking with the boys i was able to learn a great deal about the sport anytime you have national champions from our area i believe we should celebrate them i am proud of what they have accomplished and im sure that residents across michiana are feeling the same way
4225688 i am not a wolf i have never harmed a person in my life but i am not a sheep either i know these forces are out there and wishing it were not so will not only not make them go away it will rob me of my chance to kick their ass when they show up
4225689 dick in berlin i had returned from the us some years before to my hometown berlin which then was struggling with the big dramatic changes which had occurred as a result of the collapse of a system which i never believed would happen
4225690 this is probably not the best time to do this
4225691 i havent had too many of those days in the last few months
4225692 i need to go see the chiropractor if hes open right now
4225693 ive got a rib thats been bothering me for the last couple of weeks and it kinda slipped out on that last throw so its not a comfortable feeling
4225694 something like this isnt gonna hurt him and hell get it fixed and popped out and all that
4225695 you know part of what we do is working through pain and this is just unfortunate timing that ive been healthy all year until now so theres not a chance you wont see me out on the field on friday
4225696 if you wait until the last minute to prepare everything you will forget something thats pretty critical i promise
4225697 like a shot put or youll pack two left shoes or something like that you wont realize it until you get there
4225698 really my ultimate goal is not to win a medal its to perform at my highest level possible
4225699 its the early stages of dating she is a little boy crazy over him
4225700 were going to do an obama benefit on the 23rd of september at the wiltern theater in los angeles hes the better candidate and more in line with our views im just a liberal guy
4225701 weve been doing political benefits for years and its an endorsement
4225702 the support and the trust from the team helped me get this today
4225703 pawn investigator eli delgado received a pawn hit on a laptop from value pawn inv delgado began to examine the pawn activity of this subject he determined that the subject had pawned over 16 times in the last month and that most of the items were computers inv delgado then called the computer manufacturers to determine who originally purchased them he ascertained that the listed businesses had bought the computers
4225704 for small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love
4225705 i think that our system is trying to treat everybody under a particular brand and it doesnt work
4225706 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its needless and its not warranted
4225707 i understand how everybody deserves a second chance and all but im not willing to risk my children and my neighbors to find out if theyre rehabilitated or not
4225708 my evolution in this whole process if its meant to create positive change then great im all for that
4225709 its what i call a tough policy thats not smart
4225710 i might catch some flak for saying this but you know theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you
4225711 for example ryan is from st louis and st louis it seems like they support their team theyre out there and encouraging in philly cant be no punk
4225712 sono qui il che in due parole significa che preferirei morire che rinunciare a te
4225713 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
4225714 it s the best performance of my career so far
4225715 but we were all very charged up and strangely very confident before the final
4225716 it s perhaps the biggest change that bob houghton coach has engineered he has made us believe that it s all about the whole team and it s all about confidence
4225717 i ve matured since my bagan days in hindsight i feel the move to jct came at the perfect moment
4225718 he is just amazing it s not only about his european experience or knowledge of the game it is also about the way he motivates players who are young and not so young his approach is more psychological and he commands respect
4225719 i m making less mistakes these days i take a lot more responsibility on the field and i ve learnt a lot from the seniors
4225720 let me make it clear again it s not about one player it s not one person scoring and winning matches for india when bhutia will leave we ll all be ready so that his absence doesn t hurt the team we know how big a task that will be though
4225721 i think there are better choices for sen mccain that have the approval of value voters
4225722 the issue is that in many ways mitt romney has had very definite swings of position
4225723 not just on one or two things but on many of the issues
4225724 look john kerry has been vetted he ran for president i think he would be a strong choice hed be a good choice especially in the context of foreign policy
4225725 to gain a greater understanding of them enabling us to work with facts
4225726 once you get over the fear its really really enjoyable its quite a free feeling
4225727 but notes that notwithstanding this agreement violence continues with civilians bearing the brunt
4225728 to respect and protect civilians in accordance with international humanitarian law and human rights law
4225729 to control forces under their command to ensure that the current state of lawlessness ceases
4225730 have begun providing relief supplies to tens of thousands of affected persons in those areas of the country that are accessible
4225731 however large parts of the conflict affected area particularly south ossetia and the gori region remain for the most part inaccessible to humanitarian organisations due to ongoing insecurity lawlessness and other constraints
4225732 safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4225733 honour this commitment and take immediate measures to allow and facilitate the work of humanitarian actors in assessing the needs of the conflict affected population and to ensure their safety
4225734 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4225735 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4225736 it looks as if this plan tilts in the russian favour
4225737 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control
4225738 there is nothing in here about the inviolability of georgias frontiers
4225739 we are cleaning roads because we have information that there are some mines

4225743 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head back and saw big flames
4225744 we rushed to the site and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burnt prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4225745 when we looked at the trade offs it seemed like a wise thing to do
4225746 a little more breathing room but there was also a fair amount of disappointment
4225747 give very little weight to an accused terrorists claims of abuse
4225748 just a few years ago only a celebrity chef could have stirred up so much epicurean excitement
4225749 in the past people would call me and ask where can i pick apples where can i pick pumpkins
4225750 the thought of a farm being our farm is new
4225751 amy is a legend people meet her and they swoon
4225752 knowing my father he will be running circles around the rest of us in a matter of weeks
4225753 while obama is doing well with minority women with support from 89 of african americans and 62 of hispanics mccain garnered support from nearly half of caucasian women surveyed 47 vs 38 for obama hispanic women 14 were more undecided than african americans 4 or caucasians 11
4225754 what am i supposed to do with that i had to get on the web
4225755 and we are able to do that but it doesnt mean that the patient is very comfortable
4225756 if home health isnt available or doesnt show up or if your friend or neighbor or family member doesnt know how to help you then what do you have
4225757 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4225758 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4225759 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion

4225762 the vast majority of economists agree that capitalism is the most sound system there is for producing wealth and responding to demand
4225763 asterick what is new about this fantastic new psp model
4225764 its good news for taxpayers that these full expense details are being published for the first time
4225765 now every taxpayer in wales can hold their assembly member to account for excessive expense claims
4225766 id like to see a user in it hopefully not another speculator
4225767 ideally its built for one tenant but it can accommodate multiple tenants
4225768 its clear that with new starters coming together on the offensive line there will be a tremendous amount of competition there
4225769 i think overall coming into this program and knowing that one day i wanted to be a leader on this team was very important to me
4225770 i learned from the older guys understanding what the program is about and the philosophy of coach carroll hopefully i can give the same competitive leadership to the younger guys and lead this team through the season

4225775 we decline to disagree with some points brought up by previous parties that have engaged with the question
4225776 there is a lot of crap coming out for the wii
4225777 the wii is a very cost effective platform to experiment with there is a lot of crap coming out for the wii in general but if its not a good game it doesnt sell
4225778 that flood of crap will die down as publishers become more coherent
4225779 there is a lot of crap coming out for the wii
4225780 in this market i would advise any seller to sell at the first opportunity they can
4225781 banks are not in the business of buying and selling property they simply want to have their loans repaid with interest
4225782 its not a good time to put major money into renovations
4225783 spend the money on the little things to provide a good curb appeal but dont remodel the kitchen or bath
4225784 the 17 year old victim was wrestling with another teammate police said when he allegedly heard the defendant tell his opponent to pin him to the mat while the victim was pinned on his back police said the defendant approached bent down and exposed his genitals in the victims face
4225785 treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4225786 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4225787 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4225790 adam is aware of the things that need to be done in order to take the next step
4225791 thats at goodells discretion and i dont want to do or say anything that would imply that im getting anxious or pushy about it
4225792 commissioner goodell told jones that his continued participation in the nfl depends on demonstrating that he can conduct himself in a lawful and reliable manner
4225793 jones will be expected to continue the personal conduct program established by the nfl and the cowboys and to avoid further adverse involvement with law enforcement
4225794 the important thing is getting him here and getting him acclimated
4225795 i have told him you are a good kid we know you and were looking forward to having you on the team and were excited about you proving everybody wrong
4225796 were just doing everything we can do to have an uneventful training camp relative to adam and hes doing his part
4225797 hes working his tail off hes making it that way
4225798 if adam jones can come out and help us here great

4226108 although we have not yet seen the text of the joint business agreement todays announcement is problematic on several fronts
4226109 for example the scope clause in our current collective bargaining agreement does not include an exception for a joint business agreement between american airlines and another airline management therefore needs apas consent before this joint business agreement can go forward
4226110 todays announcement illustrates that american airlines management can negotiate complex agreements on a timely basis when they want to do so
4226111 its indicative of managements misplaced priorities that they that arent willing to apply the same sense of urgency toward negotiating new collective bargaining agreements with their employees
4226112 moreover it seems to us that management should focus first on running a more reliable operation before embarking on a new venture of this magnitude and complexity
4226113 our airline unfortunately continues to lag the industry to an embarrassing
4226114 that said we understand clearly why the other carriers would want to link up with american airlines the u s aviation market is the worlds largest and most lucrative
4226115 and thats precisely why we have such serious concerns apa agrees with both john mccain and barack obama we oppose any scheme that jeopardizes american jobs
4226116 make no mistake we want american airlines to succeed but that success cannot come at the expense of the employees
4226117 we have serious job security concerns that must be addressed as part of any revenue producing agreement with another airline

4226154 i believe it is important for us to stand side by side and face the voters before the general election we need to appear at events where members of the public or members of the media can ask us questions directly
4226155 it is crucial that voters know our stands on the issues where we agree and where we disagree

4226165 we cant stop them from wandering around and talking to people but everyone has a booth and the policy of the tillamook county fair is that you have the booth and you stay in the booth
4226166 my assumption would be that mike would be walking around shaking hands with a staffer or a volunteer and the staffer had literature in their hand
4226167 if he had been any type of decent politician he would have just come to the front of the fair and asked if it was ok
4226168 people were really upset he was really aggressive we got several complaints
4226169 it wasnt just mike erickson it has been a few other politicians as well

4226175 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4226242 a local warlord the chinese emperor or even the dalai lamas government in lhasa might have tried to impose its choice of tulku on a monastery for political reasons

4226285 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better
4226286 there has been a sufficient amount of pessimism to warrant a short term rally
4226287 for the average american these inflation numbers are very bad news it means that their purchasing power has been cut and their wages arent going very far
4226288 all of their costs are rising very quickly and they are getting hammered
4226289 were retired and you can see it in the grocery stores
4226290 today we got the truly shocking news that inflation hit a 17 year high of 5 6 percent

4226344 mr bale who denies the allegation cooperated throughout gave his account in full of the events in question and has left the station without any charge being made against him by the police at this time there will be no further comment by mr bale
4226345 this incident is just another reminder that illegal activity at our border is still a major problem in our country and that the men and woman of our border patrol are knowingly putting their lives at risk

4226348 the summer stramash an open air garden party is annually supported well by both expats and russians and is a great day out for the whole family
4226349 at our restaurant everything is normal we havent had fewer clients on friday and saturday practically all the tables were reserved we have good food that people in moscow know and love and they come here to spend time with pleasure
4226350 when we lived poorly there were no problems with traffic jams now we have begun to live better and they have appeared furthermore because one family nowadays already has two cars
4226351 many moscow families will have not two but three cars
4226352 if the number of traffic jams grows at the same rate and the condition of roads and overpasses remains the same then within a year in the fall of 2008 on four of five work days driving in moscow at rush hour will become impossible the amount of traffic will regularly reach ten points the highest level on yandexs overall ranking of the citys traffic and this is without considering any additional factors for example bad weather
4226353 a concrete example of the problem is that a four to five lane highway from moscow turns into a two lane provincial road and this causes congestion at the exit
4226354 its very clean but its a bit disappointing that people push and shove and dont say im sorry in the summer it is impossible because of people sweating in the winter it is impossible because of all the people and there are thieves
4226355 its fun all these stupid things people talk about like freedom and the feeling of flight are true

4226358 it is a way of escaping moscows everyday working day
4226359 it is a kind of outside exercise and you are really awake when you finally reach work

4226361 there are not very many bicycling roads so it is not good to bicycle in the city center

4226370 we shouldnt have to regulate so harshly these kinds of things
4226371 whats the big deal reenactments sound cool and its got to be better than sitting at home all weekend
4226372 along the way we discovered the pivotal roles played by teachers beliefs and attitudes about knowledge about language and about teaching and learning as well as the role of the institution of schools in traditionally supporting one particular view of the purposes and goals for education
4226373 we have come to believe that schools can must change from the bottom upfrom changes in the ways individual teachers teach and learn with their students to changes in the voices and authority teachers assert in school decision making to changes in school governance and relationships among educators at all levels in the school setting in the end learning change is our call for a more genuine democratic education in american schools

4226413 for those of us in the middle the question becomes whether greater central direction of the economy i
4226414 is this a fair representation of the choices available or do you have another perspective overall how do you respond to this point
4226415 so as i see it i less government and lower taxes are generally better for the poor and working class you describe and ii hamilton county and ohio are tax hell for businesses and individuals meaning that rapacious and oppressive governments are creating tremendous misery for the very folks big government advocates claim to want to help
4226416 l ess government and lower taxes are generally better for the poor and working class you describe
4226417 unquestionably the lottery is nothing more than a tax on the very poorest stupidest citizens in our society yet when was the last time you heard a politician suggest opposing this terribly regressive oppressive tax on poor people never why because they are wed to the notion of helping people with big government and the attaboys and campaign contributions that come with without the slightest desire to really consider the impact on the people they claim to be helping state lotteries are a terrible and cynical attack on the poorest of our citizens and no one absolutely no one cares about them not one political party not one politician from an economic perspective this analysis about the lottery is indisputably true if so why wont one single solitary person stand up and at least say something about it much less do something about it
4226418 lower taxes and responsible spending benefit everyone this is not a hard concept to understand just difficult to follow it with principle year after year the price of liberty is eternal vigilance if folks continue to fall under the sway of slick politicians then they pay the price for doing so we saw this in the jail tax campaign the hunger of government for more tax money is unbounded and the resulting policies to justify the extraction of that cash are many times worse than paying the tax itself

4226426 i got off to a great start and made tons of putts
4226427 i missed a few opportunities on the second nine but i made a birdie to finish on a high note so im very pleased this course is tough and 5 under id take that any day here
4226428 id say the difference between the back nine and the front is the greens theyre not as undulating
4226429 but i want to say i had a career putting round
4226430 i cant remember the last time i had 10 putts on nine holes thats what you need to score here
4226431 i dont think the trend of today rounds of 5 under or 4 under are going to continue the rest of the week
4226432 i dont think well see 11 under or 10 under on the very last day maybe 8 under or 7 under will win it
4226433 im pretty happy about the score because out there its pretty narrow and greens are fast and have undulations

4226440 it does not really matter whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for arctic sea ice
4226441 the crucial point is that ice is clearly not building up enough over winter to restore cover and that when you combine current estimates of ice thickness with the extent of the ice cap you get a very clear indication that the arctic is going to be ice free in summer in five years

4226466 its hard for me to see how this kind of tug of war serves the public
4226467 they were asking us to come to a conclusion that is not a typical conclusion that we would come to
4226468 he rosenberg was concerned that the criminal defense attorney for ochoa had already gone to a local newspaper i think it was oc weekly and had talked about the case and was concerned that he would raise a stink that his client had been incarcerated for all that time
4226469 ive met with our members and they have indicated it is not uncommon to receive phone calls from prosecutors questioning samples and giving suggestions that could benefit their cases
4226470 they analysts feel it is unnecessary and puts them in a difficult position
4226471 we feel ethically we cant put junk science on the stand
4226472 on a complex mixture which contains dna for more than one person two people can look at something and see different interpretations
4226473 this is just typical if this case didnt qualify for a 30 day turnaround i dont know what does
4226474 from day one we were shut out of that project
4226475 dean went out of his way to say i will not try to tell you to do it or not to do it i know he was trying to be very correct said grubb
4226476 i want us focused on the san diego backlog and not doing favors for any other county
4226477 i guarantee you within that period the suspect was doing other crimes
4226478 were hoping we can get some cooperative spirit going between the sheriff and the d a but if it cant happen im glad to work with my fellow board members to create a whole separate crime lab with a medical examiner

4226480 h e finally caught a break when a church official put him in touch with his attorney who agreed to take on the case for free if thomas would sign an agreement to pay 2 500 if he was found to be lying about not being the father

4226483 despite 20 years of research the development of a hormonal method acceptable to a wide population of men is unlikely
4226484 you can lead a horse to water but you cant make it drink
4226485 the pharmaceutical industry is completely disconnected from the public and medical perceptions of need
4226486 the biggest hurdle that ive encountered in trying to share this information is a sort of knee jerk reaction that men arent interested in these kinds of contraceptives and that women wont trust them to take them
4226487 my wife has never been that comfortable with the pill so it would be nice to have some other options on my end
4226488 hitting a kid with a baseball bat and breaking his jaw
4226489 i could see that education was the way out and it wasnt easy because i had these learning disabilities
4226490 it took him about a month to find me in a pe class
4226491 he said you think youre a tough guy well ive got 10 guys out here after school and i think theyre tougher than you
4226492 i thought i was going to show up and fight 10 guys but it was a football team that was the first time i ever played organized sports
4226493 thats why i think i was put in this arena to help someone people like myself and im able to reach a lot of them because im sincere i can relate to their backgrounds and where they come from
4226494 wed go to the park and take batting practice every day
4226495 i would go shag the balls put the bucket next to them and they would stand at second base i would throw one hoppers and they would catch and tag catch and tag hours and hours of doing that over the years
4226496 before we went home i would hit them fly balls
4226497 i could cut the ball and make it slice or make it take off so they could see it move and it helped them become outfielders
4226498 id say this game is not to catch the ball but to run to where you think the ball is going to go theyd turn and run to that spot and if the ball hit them depending on how many times it hit em theyd win an ice cream
4226499 beat the kids very often 2 3 times a day
4226500 una grande gara siamo stati determinati e attenti ai particolari
4226501 stata una vittoria spettacolare ed importantissima questa ottenuta nella prima gara del turno preliminare contro lartmedia bratislava scrive del piero abbiamo dimostrato grande voglia di vincere determinazione ed attenzione nei particolari cose che ci hanno consentito di fare una buona gara creando molte occasioni e concedendo poco ai nostri avversari sono molto contento per la vittoria e per il mio bel gol ora serve unaltra ottima gara il 26 agosto in modo da ritornare finalmente a disputare la champions league
4226502 on the front page of wednesdays new york times is an article about a new book by jerome corsi that bashes barack obama four years ago mr corsi wrote an anti kerry book and freely admits he wants conservatives in the white house
4226503 now these kinds of books are not unusual there are scores of anti bush books around the latest one by scott mcclellan but corsis book is opening at no 1 on the best seller list and there is a good reason why
4226504 some voters who dont like obama want their opinion reinforced and other voters who are undecided about him are seeking information even if it is negative because the senator simply will not sit for challenging interviews many questions about him and his background remain unanswered
4226505 now you may remember last january that the senator told me hed come on
4226506 so what am i to think the man looked me in the eye patted me on my shoulder and now hes not doing what he said hed do we hope the senator changes his mind but this dance has been going on far too long
4226507 so as both a journalist and a voter i would like to know why barack obama is so hesitant to define himself its simply not enough for me to listen to speeches written by other people and watch in the tank interviewers chat with him i mean i like softball but enoughs enough
4226508 as everybody knows weve been very fair to senator obama and to senator mccain we criticize them when we feel theyre wrong we set the record straight if we think theyre getting hosed neither candidate should have a beef with us
4226509 the end game is this if barack obama continues to hide himself from american voters he encourages negative information against him now he might win the election anyway but the obama campaign is making a major mistake by hiding their candidate

4226512 kuberikan wanita kekuatan untuk dapat melahirkan bayi dari rahimnya walau kerap berulangkali menerima cerca dari si bayi itu apabila dia telah membesar
4226513 kuberikan keperkasaan yang akan membuatnya tetap bertahan pantang menyerah saat semua orang sudah putus asa
4226514 ku berikan kesabaran jiwa untuk merawat keluarganya walau dia sendiri letih walau sakit walau penat tanpa berkeluh kesah
4226515 kuberikan wanita perasaan peka dan kasih sayang untuk mencintai semua anaknya dalam apa jua keadaan dan situasi
4226516 kuberikan wanita kekuatan untuk membimbing suaminya melalui masa masa sukar dan menjadi pelindung baginya sebab bukannya tulang rusuk yang melindungi setiap hati dan jantung agar tak terkoyak
4226517 kuberikan kepadanya kebijaksanaan dan kemampuan untuk memberikan pengertian dan menyedarkan bahawa suami yang baik adalah yang tidak pernah melukai isterinya
4226518 dan akhirnya kuberikan wanita air mata agar dapat mencurahkan perasaannya
4226519 im not at all pleased with the trade for a number of reasons
4226520 number one i dont see how a 39 year old quarterback can come in here and turn a 4 12 team into a 12 4 team or even a 10 6 team i was expecting a 500 season with pennington and havent changed my mind people forget that before last season favre was pretty ordinary for two years so as a rebuilding team we gave up important draft picks for a guy who is coming off his first good year in the last three and didnt want to come here until every other option was gone we practically had to beg the guy typical jets
4226521 we didnt need a quarterback is favre better than pennington yes but not so much that we had to give up anything to get him besides any true jet fan will tell you that hell be hurt before the leaves turn a 253 game starting streak is small potatoes for the jet jinx
4226522 the guy won i never cared about the arm strength or the slow feet we stink almost every year but when pennington played we won the guy beat peyton manning in a playoff game one year and had us a short field goal away from the afc title game in another he didnt miss those two kicks mangini coached in new england with two strong armed pro bowlers in brady and bledsoe he just never warmed up to chad well hed better hope this works out because i dont think bellichick will take him back if it doesnt
4226523 now we too have behaved like nazis and my whole being is shaken

4226542 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4226543 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4226544 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4226545 if there is no agreement on the government in zimbabwe the president will not attend the summit
4226546 chinas position on the tibetan issue is consistent and clear

4226555 ok i tried to run to the gym workout and run back well about a mile in my lower back started to flare up real bad i was thinking that there was no way in uzbekistan that i was going to be able to do this so i walk jog walked the rest of the way to the gym lifted and realized how freaking hard it is to jog back home after i walked like a mile and had a mile and a half left i decided to jog and see how far i got well i think i started off too fast the first time or maybe just stretched my back out because i made it the whole way home in about 12 mins little to no back pain so day one was inconclusive wednesday is day two as i will hopefully be able to do the full 2 5 miles to and then back from the gym if that works out ill go for 5 on friday
4226556 once you get over the fear its really really enjoyable its quite a free feeling

4226559 our country simply cannot afford to have insecure supply of electricity
4226560 we dont think banning new thermal baseload is necessary to encourage investment in renewables it is happening already one major generator with approval to build a combined cycle gas plant has shelved that in favour of massive investment in geothermal and wind power
4226561 we say trust the market a price on carbon will do the job of encouraging renewables
4226562 without these details todays announcement is simply a mandate for heavier reliance on coal and gas which is not the way of the future
4226563 they want to borrow from future generations so that their fossil fuel friends can make more money today
4226564 a guy in his stature what hes done in this league to be on a new team now it is going to be a media circus for that game

4226566 i fully expect our sideline to all be standing up
4226567 if we let down at all he could still throw the ball and the plays that he does know hell know how to execute them
4226568 hes only going to be in there for a bit so the fun will be over very quickly the festive like atmosphere will be over very quickly im getting ready for a game and our players have to do the same
4226569 we know who he is and his credibility in the league but its preseason and its not like we game plan

4226577 the shootout has proved to be an exciting addition to hockey at a variety of levels and we are anxious to bring it into college hockey the drama it creates is very popular with fans and importantly todays players love it
4226578 at the same time the ncaa rules and ice hockey committees have allowed us to implement this tie breaker protocol so that every regular season league game will have a winner while preserving the integrity of the national rankings because ccha games decided by a shootout will still be considered ties for ncaa purposes bonus points awarded will impact the conference standings only
4226579 this is a bold decision and i think its a great one
4226580 college hockey is already one of the most exciting sports in america adding the shootout just adds to the excitement
4226581 as administrators it isnt our place to change things without adequate input for the past two years weve received feedback from all constituencies weve also been given a direction to make decisions that reward speed creativity and skill while maintaining the games safety and integrity by allowing shootouts the rules committee gave conferences a means to enhance game excitement we are always careful when making changes as there can be unintended consequences in this case the ccha council was comfortable that shootouts will have no direct impact on the rpi and also felt that shootouts are in the best interest of the game at this time
4226582 im excited about our league adopting it and its going to add a tremendous amount of excitement to the game fans will really love it and players love working on shootout moves in practice so theyre going to love doing it in a game so its a win win situation when you look at it from that perspective
4226583 shootouts are going to be great for our fans they will keep people excited and in their seats right up until the last goal or save its going to be something that they will keep talking and raving about
4226584 a shootout may be conducted at the end of the five minute overtime period for advancement purposes in conference games or by mutual consent of both teams

4226591 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4226592 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4226593 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4226594 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4226595 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4226596 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4226597 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4226598 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4226599 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4226600 which one would you like the milk or the juice
4226601 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4226602 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4226603 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4226604 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

4226607 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4226608 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4226609 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4226610 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4226611 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4226612 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4226613 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4226614 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

4226620 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4226621 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4226622 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4226623 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4226624 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4226625 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4226626 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4226627 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4226628 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4226629 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4226630 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4226631 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4226632 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4226633 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4226634 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4226635 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4226636 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4226637 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4226638 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4226639 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4226640 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4226641 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4226642 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4226643 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4226644 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4226645 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4226646 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4226647 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4226648 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4226649 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4226650 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4226651 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4226652 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4226653 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4226654 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

4226668 una decepci n porque ten a como claro objetivo la consecuci n de la medalla de oro ya no est a mi alcance pero james jug muy bien y me alegro por l
4226669 durante el partido tuve algunas opciones pero blake hizo un partido muy completo comet errores no fue mi mejor d a y l lo aprovech no jugu bien
4226670 no estoy feliz con lo que me ha deparado este torneo en los ltimos tiempos no he llevado la trayectoria esperada a pesar de que los torneos han sido en pista dura termin pronto en toronto y cincinnati tengo que buscar nuevas expectativas
4226671 la competici n sigue y est el tramo final de la temporada con el abierto de estados unidos y la copa masters en shangai
4226672 la confianza falla cuando los resultados son adversos y uno pierde partidos
4226673 no es normal estos resultados mi juego y mi r cord es muy distinto estoy lejos de esos n meros
4226674 no es la preparaci n ideal y los compromisos se acumulan sobre todo si tienes intenci n de ganar el individual y el dobles pero estas situaciones son las mismas para los dos
4226675 ganar una medalla es impresionante y jugar la final mucho m s
4226676 disputar una final ol mpica ser a impresionante ya lo ser a lograr una medalla
4226677 el d a ha sido largo pero con un buen resultado he disputado un gran primer set el segundo tambi n ha estado bien pero despu s l me ha roto el servicio y se ha complicado
4226678 he ganado tres partidos jugando a un gran nivel y s lo haciendo lo mejor podr ganar tambi n a djokovic
4226679 hay mucha igualdad en el tenis y lo que no es normal es que federer y yo coincidamos tantas veces lo normal ser a que unas veces fallara uno y otras otro porque hay mucha igualdad
4226680 es un central aplicado r pido y que va bien de cabeza esperemos que aqu confirme sus condiciones de gran jugador
4226681 se encuentra muy bien ya sali de cuidados intensivos y fue pasado a una habitaci n por eso lo m s probable es que hoy se le de de alta
4226682 la arritmia se cura en forma definitiva estamos muy contentos con el procedimiento el paciente tambi n est muy contento
4226683 es una gran experiencia y oportunidad el poder estar en un club vencedor espa ol
4226684 el club voleibol almer a ha realizado mi sue o de poder estar en este continente y poder disputar una gran competici n la estructura que he encontrado aqu es muy fuerte muy buena y con la calidad suficiente para poder aumentar los t tulos
4226685 la calidad de la gente del material que tenemos y del cuerpo t cnico es suficiente para lograr estar en las finales de las competiciones tanto nacionales como extranjeras e incluso poder ser campeones
4226686 esto es algo que muy pocos clubes pueden celebrar para nosotros es todo un orgullo haber llevado el nombre de almer a no s lo por espa a sino por toda europa
4226687 enorme responsabilidad dado el recorrido del equipo a lo largo de la historia y teniendo en cuenta el nivel de los t cnicos que han pasado por su banquillo
4226688 busc bamos un entrenador extranjero con un perfil de veteran a y de gran experiencia en el entrenamiento de equipos de alta competici n que perfectamente encaja con el de carlos alberto
4226689 federer y nadal han dominado los torneos cuando me los he cruzado estaban en su mejor momento pero qu duda cabe que es mejor jugar con blake que con federer
4226690 es un rival muy complicado porque f sicamente es fuerte y est entre los mejores del mundo ha ganado a federer y eso lo dice todo
4226691 de c mo he evolucionado en esta semana he aprovechado las ocasiones que he tenido y desde el principio he ido a m s sobre todo en los dos ltimos partidos espero a n ir a m s
4226692 vine con la ilusi n de ganar una medalla uno juega por el pa s y eso me alienta pero todos los que ganamos tenemos experiencia a n no me planteo el oro me centro en lo de ma ana

4226695 se trata de un evento in dito mundialmente en formato nico y con tecnolog a importada estoy seguro que ser un hito para los deportes de nieve para la ciudad de r o de janeiro y para brasil
4226696 la estructura suntuosa para el evento de final de a o en r o de janeiro no tiene nada que ver con la de viradouro que fue una pista muy peque a 20 metros
4226697 ser una t cnica diferente a la que utiliz bamos antes ya que hemos desarrollando nuevos materiales y soluciones para este tipo de competiciones en estructuras artificiales
4226698 ya autorizamos el evento y daremos todo el apoyo en asuntos como transporte tr fico y seguridad en desarrollo de nuestra pol tica de incentivar competiciones deportivas al aire libre y en espacios p blicos

4226803 we initially hypothesized that proximity to a highway would affect less affluent mothers to a greater extent than affluent ones we thought that less affluent mothers living near a highway would disproportionally suffer from the double burden of economic disadvantage and pollution

4226845 where is the buddhist rielle she was a very grounded spiritual beautiful person
4226846 it was a different generation than my own today it would come under the rubric of valley girl talk the use of like instead of to say they were open speaking about sex
4226847 rielle is the black sheep of the family we were all raised the same way she chose a different path

4226858 up to the point of what occurred at the campground
4226859 its a phosphorylation switch controlled by doubletime that determines whether the protein is active at all
4226860 if you cant phosphorylate the first site you automatically skip to the second site phosphorylate it prematurely and produce a hyperactive repressor
4226861 with a repressor that acts too soon and goes away too quickly you get a short period phenotype
4226862 many of the features that theyre seeing in humans are consistent with what were finding in flies
4226863 so it may help us understand the human syndrome as well
4226864 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
4226865 the results are actually highly dependent on the surface chemistry
4226866 in other words you dont get this result just by attaching drugs to any nanotubes
4226867 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumor
4226868 but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumor which should further enhance the treatment efficacy
4226869 we are definitely hoping to be able to push this to practical applications into the clinic this is one step forward
4226870 but it will still take time to truly prove the efficacy and the safety

4226880 you ask me how i know he lives he lives within my heart
4226881 since what may be known about god is plain to them because god has made it palain to them for since the creation of the world gods invisible qualities his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made so that men are without excuse
4226882 how do you know your experiences are any less valid than someone from a different religion

4226887 we christians are to share the reasons to believe with every person we know
4226888 we should be proclaiming the whole scripture the relationship between god and humanity
4226889 do not think that i came here to bring peace on earth i did not come to bring peace but a sword
4226890 most assuredly i say to you we speak what we know and testify what we have seen and you do not receive our witness if i have told you earthly things and you do not believe how will you believe if i tell you heavenly things no one has ascended to heaven but he who came down from heaven that is the son of man who is in heaven and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he who believes in him is not condemned but he does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god and this is the condemnation that the light has come into the world and men loved darkness rather then light because their deeds were evil for everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light lest his deeds should be exposed but he who does the truth comes to the light that his deeds may be clearly seen that they have been done in god

4226904 were using spore as a nexus for explaining these theories on evolutionary biology
4226905 millions of people contribute content like planets buildings and creatures to your game but its not real time
4226906 youre seeing copies of peoples stuff so you can go up and blow up a planet and you havent ruined their experience

4226924 before you hire a company to build a house you would i expect insist on detailed plans showing what the finished structure was going to look like building a childs mind and character is what public schools do their justification for prematurely breaking family and neighborhood learning where is documentary evidence to prove this assumption that trained and certified professionals do it better than people who know and love them can there isnt any the cost in new york state for building a well schooled child in the year 2000 is 200 000 per body when lost interest is calculated that capital sum invested in the childs name over the past twelve years would have delivered a million dollars to each kid as a nest egg to compensate for having no school the original 200 000 is more than the average home in new york costs you wouldnt build a home without some idea what it would look like when finished but you are compelled to let a corps of perfect strangers tinker with your childs mind and personality without the foggiest idea what they want to do with it

4226933 this is a tribute to staff families and students who are stretching themselves
4226934 over the course of that time weve seen a trend of more students taking it and yet our student average performance is increasing
4226935 on one hand the act has more meaning to students certainly the motivation for the act is considerably higher than for kids taking the map
4226936 on the other hand it does not include all students thats why its imperative to have multiple measures of achievement
4226937 for complex things like education and student achievement we should have multiple ways of analyzing them
4226938 la charla con simeone fue cortita le dije lo que sent a l lo entendi y me dijo que le d para adelante que hable con los dirigentes y si estaba todo arreglado que le meta y tenga mucha suerte

4226975 wijnand duyvendak heeft mij en de fractie al eerder ge nformeerd over zijn verleden ik heb hem aangemoedigd om daarover verantwoording af te leggen ik vind dat acties altijd binnen de grenzen van de wet dienen te blijven en wijs er op dat wijnand duyvendak dat inzicht in zijn boek uitdraagt en verantwoording aflegt over de acties in de jaren tachtig in het algemeen vind ik het van groot belang dat politici openheid betrachten over hun maatschappelijke activiteiten in het verleden en het maatschappelijke debat daarover niet schuwen
4226976 that could be one person involved in all of those
4226977 state and local governments businesses organizations and concerned citizens have all worked together tirelessly in this fight against needless loss of lives and futures while todays announcement is great news there is no acceptable level when it comes to traffic fatalities so we cannot let up

4226984 here im saying clearly i oppose barack obama and the book is designed to lay this information out and let the american public decide
4226985 he was registered as a muslim the documentation i thoroughly researched it from the indonesian newspapers and indonesian television he attended mosque with his stepfather
4226986 the friends who were in school with him attest that he was then considered a muslim and thats the testimony of the people in indonesia who grew up in those six years
4226987 right now vile smear peddler jerome corsi is back with a new book of lies this time about barack obama well need the combined efforts of every member of the action wire to push back against this years vicious republican attack book
4226988 together well show corsi and the right wing smear machine that we wont back down from a fight

4226992 you cant take a few quips that ive wrote that ive apologized for that should not have been written and i have not done again to be representative of my beliefs and writing
4226993 i dont think anybodys going to take jerome corsi all that seriously once they learn who this guy really is even people on the right wing havent associated themselves with him because of some of the pretty bigoted and outrageous things hes said in his career
4226994 now four years later he has come out with another book that is also riddled with distortions and falsehoods so the question is why on earth would anyone listen to what he has to say about barack obama
4226995 ive written against john mccain very strongly for the last four years on his immigration policy i wrote a series of articles in world net daily of john mccains connections with george soros the book is not written to support john mccain i am constitution party i make it very clear in the introduction ill be voting for chuck baldwin of the constitution party

4227061 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better
4227062 the large overall monthly gain was once again attributable to gasoline prices which jumped 4 1 per cent in the month

4227469 this is a judge and we dont know how often this happens who simply refused to perform her function in a responsible way
4227470 it amazes me that mr bentley is quick to jump to the conclusion that there is a need for a legislative change when in fact what we may have here is simply a judge who wasnt up to the job and wasnt doing her job
4227471 its unbelievable that somebody could have had a lengthy criminal record and that no one asked
4227472 the judge didnt know and yet that judge was then put in a position where she made a decision without having that information in front of her its unbelievable

4227488 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4227489 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4227490 to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4227491 senator obamas campaign encouraged senator clintons name to be placed in nomination as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4227492 senator obama and senator clinton are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee and to victory this fall for america
4227493 after the state by state roll is tallied mrs clinton is expected to turn over her cache of delegates to senator barack obama
4227494 so how will mrs clinton who is a superdelegate herself vote associates say she will throw her lot behind mr obama and ask her supporters to follow suit

4227498 the commissioning of our snowflake biomass plant marked an important milestone for the company and an exciting transition in our business to the onset of commercial power generation and electricity sales
4227499 the plant has performed well to date and is consistently producing approximately 20 mw of power as is expected with the start up of any new power generating facility we are continuing to fine tune the operations to further improve performance and maximize the electrical output of the plant
4227500 our primary financial objective is to bring additional capital into the company to advance our strategic growth initiatives and create additional value in the business
4227501 to this end we continue to actively pursue a variety of funding opportunities that could be realized within the next few months
4227502 at the same time because of my strong belief in this business i intend to assist with renegys working capital needs throughout the remainder of 2008 as needed while we work to secure additional financing to allow me to make additional investments in the company our board of directors has agreed to waive the provision preventing me from increasing my ownership position in the company
4227503 total revenues during the three months ended june 30 2008 included just a partial quarter of electricity sales from our snowflake plant as a result the positive impact of snowflakes operations on our financial performance will become more evident in the third quarter when we expect to recognize our first full quarter of revenues derived from the electrical output of the plant
4227504 our second quarter results also demonstrated a notable reduction in general administrative and development expenses when compared with the first quarter of this year while we are pleased with our progress over the past few months in managing our costs and expenses we have not yet achieved a level of spending that meets our objectives accordingly we remain committed to an ongoing evaluation of our corporate and administrative expenses and maintaining a lean cost structure throughout the organization
4227505 we hear lots of promises and figures but we want to make sure that these projects do what they say theyre going to do
4227506 were not talking about building a hospital were not talking about a railroad thats going to take us to the west were talking about developers

4227520 were proud to report the best quarter in the history of webtrends with bookings even higher than our record revenues adding to our software as a service subscription base
4227521 our record quarter and the increased demand for our solution is a direct result of shipping substantive products that satisfy real needs investing in customer support and services to ensure our clients success and focusing on product innovation in strategic growth areas
4227522 webtrends has moved beyond simplistic solutions that skim the surface
4227523 those products are great for the mass market but were focused on delivering a customized marketing solution to our enterprise customers that they cant get from the countless out of the box reports that other analytics providers offer
4227524 it has been clearly stated to me that this is a working document that has dated information
4227525 im surprised that we take a document out of the thousands that were generated and pick what we want to advance an agenda
4227526 there are so many concerns in this that have not been finalized
4227527 these are major issues that we are just glossing over
4227528 i think we are right where we want to be
4227529 unless for some reason they decided to build two separate mechanisms into the iphone to do this of which the other one is invisible this one likely feeds a master kill switch perhaps there is a special setting in the configuration file which can vaporize the app all together of course this is just speculation but as i said before it would be irresponsible to have a blacklist but only use it to kill gps applications

4227535 the discrimination in this case ended up costing american soldiers their lives

4227605 our focus throughout 2008 has been on streamlining our operations and reducing costs in order to generate positive ebitda we began the year by improving our ebitda margin by 52 in the first quarter of 2008 over the fourth quarter of 2007 we continued this trend by improving our margin another 6 5 in the second quarter through our cost controlling initiatives notably our margin was increased by 26 over the previous quarter
4227606 as part of our strategy to improve operating results our marketing efforts were focused on targeted areas as opposed to a more broadly based marketing program employed in 2007 leading to flat revenue growth over our previous quarter however in the presence of flat revenue growth our margin improvement is directly attributable to our cost controlling initiatives in addition this was an unusual quarter for the company as we experienced severe weather in many of our midwestern markets resulting in higher than expected tower repairs maintenance and service credits these costs were responsible for an increase of 6 7 in our network costs over the previous quarter
4227607 we made some great strides toward our goal of generating positive ebitda our two consecutive quarters of ebitda margin improvement demonstrate that our efforts are materializing in addition we believe that the benefits of some of our cost controlling measures implemented in this quarter will be fully realized in the subsequent quarter as a result we expect the company to be ebitda positive in the third quarter
4227608 keyon continues to execute its business plan in spite of the current economic environment and turbulent capital markets in the first quarter of 2008 we added a third goal of generating positive ebitda after completing our last acquisition in october 2007 we have moderated our approach to strategic acquisitions of similar wireless broadband companies until the company is able to do so with cost effective capital finally on the strategic new product and service development front our partnership with airspan networks for the deployment of wimax in our markets is progressing well and we have been testing this product to offer high speed data and voip in one of our markets for several months

4227691 an additional rate hike would have potentially tipped the balance
4227692 our property prices should remain static for the next year this will effectively mean that with our current inflation rate we will probably not see any real price growth over the next year
4227693 however south africas economic stability and growth will continue to create job opportunities and thereby improve conditions for many people creating new entrants to the property market

4227713 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light

4227728 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4227729 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4227730 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4227731 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade

4228157 the biggest home sales gains over the previous quarter have been in some of the markets with the steepest and fastest price drops
4228158 buyers in these areas are responding to deeply discounted home prices
4228159 each of these areas has seen a strong buyer response in recent months to the big cuts in home prices
4228160 prices having fallen sharply and quickly in very distressed markets but most or all of the price declines may have already occurred in these areas since buyers have now returned to those markets

4228169 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class

4228231 the first flight was a success and made the first in situ measurements of gases in a volcanic plume using meteorological balloons
4228232 with flight visualization using google earth we were looking at tropospheric volcanic emissions of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and water which can be hazardous to human and animal health and degrade ecosystems
4228233 we could count the rows of trees to find the balloon
4228234 we are fairly confident of three findings first this work is feasible for measuring sulfur dioxide so2 and carbon dioxide co2 in volcanic emissions for several hours after eruptions second there is a loss of so2 after one hour of flight away from the source which could reflect conversion to sulfate aerosol which may lower the earths temperature by reflecting away solar radiation and third there is a clear stratification of so2 above co2 within the plumes
4228235 one of the largest subdivisions in america is ocean view and it is downwind from the volcano on the west side of the island
4228236 we detected sulfur dioxide over the development several hours after it was erupted into the atmosphere
4228237 in the past 20 to 30 years researchers have been able to shrink the size of devices and the size of the patterns that you need to make those devices following the use of the same types of lithographic materials tools and strategies only getting better and better at it
4228238 theres information encoded in the molecules that results in getting certain size and spacing of features with certain desirable properties
4228239 thermodynamic driving forces make the structures more uniform in size and higher density than you can obtain with the traditional materials
4228240 if you only have to pattern every fourth spot you can write those patterns at a fraction of the time and expense
4228241 this research addresses one of the most significant challenges to delivering patterned media the mass production of patterned disks in high volume at a reasonable cost
4228242 the large potential gains in density offered by patterned media make it one of the most promising new technologies on the horizon for future hard disk drives
4228243 these results have profound implications for advancing the performance and capabilities of lithographic materials and processes beyond current limits

4228266 any potential association between these two public health issues is of considerable interest
4228267 this suggests that taste damage from ear infections may alter food choice and thus lead to obesity risk
4228268 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits
4228269 obesity has doubled over the past 20 years among preschool children the more data we collect on what contributes to this major public health problem the greater likelihood that we can help prevent it

4228309 our focus throughout 2008 has been on streamlining our operations and reducing costs in order to generate positive ebitda we began the year by improving our ebitda margin by 52 in the first quarter of 2008 over the fourth quarter of 2007 we continued this trend by improving our margin another 6 5 in the second quarter through our cost controlling initiatives notably our margin was increased by 26 over the previous quarter
4228310 as part of our strategy to improve operating results our marketing efforts were focused on targeted areas as opposed to a more broadly based marketing program employed in 2007 leading to flat revenue growth over our previous quarter however in the presence of flat revenue growth our margin improvement is directly attributable to our cost controlling initiatives in addition this was an unusual quarter for the company as we experienced severe weather in many of our midwestern markets resulting in higher than expected tower repairs maintenance and service credits these costs were responsible for an increase of 6 7 in our network costs over the previous quarter
4228311 we made some great strides toward our goal of generating positive ebitda our two consecutive quarters of ebitda margin improvement demonstrate that our efforts are materializing in addition we believe that the benefits of some of our cost controlling measures implemented in this quarter will be fully realized in the subsequent quarter as a result we expect the company to be ebitda positive in the third quarter
4228312 keyon continues to execute its business plan in spite of the current economic environment and turbulent capital markets in the first quarter of 2008 we added a third goal of generating positive ebitda after completing our last acquisition in october 2007 we have moderated our approach to strategic acquisitions of similar wireless broadband companies until the company is able to do so with cost effective capital finally on the strategic new product and service development front our partnership with airspan networks for the deployment of wimax in our markets is progressing well and we have been testing this product to offer high speed data and voip in one of our markets for several months

4228360 for our safety we have colored lights in the air and colored lines on the road that tell us what to do while were the most advanced species on the planet we will all stop what were doing because a little red light in the air turned on
4228361 in the event we broke one of the rules and got caught a grown man wearing a uniform would come along and give us a piece of paper ultimately the paper is useless but it tells us we owe a sum of money based on our infraction yelling at the uniformed man could increase the amount of money you owe there are very few uniformed people around but most people live in fear that theyre always watching kind of like jesus but not as forgiving
4228362 the posted speed limit is 25 miles per hour ive seen average of 45 miles per hour its a cut through
4228363 people who live along this stretch say theyve already noticed efforts to have more police officers patrolling out here and there are a number of signs trying to get people to slow down but they say so far it hasnt helped

4228388 how do i bundle the work ive done for an sap administrator to install on the production server
4228389 what does it take to learn how to be productive with this software
4228390 where would i use sap netweaver ce in the future
4228391 during my first three weeks running slackware i have yet to find a single bug that is something ive never been able to write in a review of a linux distribution before and it is truly impressive
4228392 i should also note that slackware includes only one piece of non free software jre
4228393 to have hal correctly add and remove icons on my xfce desktop i had to create the hal mtab file in media it wasnt done automatically as is the case in most distributions
4228394 slackware does not include a display manager which allows you to choose your session at login unless you install kde as part of the initial installation process
4228395 slackware 12 1 is the first release to include hal support
4228396 its very easy to add a piece of software only to find it wont run due to some missing library
4228397 once you start adding software from third party sources this becomes particularly messy if you dont do your homework and track down all the dependencies on your own
4228398 its a recipe for dependency hell thats rarely seen on other major distributions in 2008
4228399 even advanced users will find slackware time consuming to install and configure properly
4228400 the fact that slackware is largely developed and maintained by one person and offers no commercial support makes it inappropriate for the corporate or institutional server room
4228401 the x lockup you encountered is actually a bug in the vesa driver shipped with xorg in 12
4228402 if i know what im doing in slackware it will work 100 of the time
4228403 correct because slackbuilds org and slacky eu the two biggest and most useful repositories ignoring linuxpackages net dont list dependencies right
4228404 why is it important that other distro offers insane number of packages how many of them do you use how often do you have to install them
4228405 i have to find all these dependencies blah blah blah
4228406 you probably screwed up since that most certainly isnt required you need to add yourself to the plugdev cdrom audio and video groups
4228407 theres almost always a trade off involved there making something easier for a beginner often makes it harder for an advanced user
4228408 ince slackware is maintained primarily though not entirely by one man pat must understand the entire system and how everything works together this is a benefit compared to debian etc in my opinion where incompatibilities may arise because of the high fractionation of jobs to different areas
4228409 correct because slackbuilds org and slacky eu the two biggest and most useful repositories ignoring linuxpackages net dont list dependencies right
4228410 an alternate 2 4 x kernel included in slackware 11 and 12 has been dropped
4228411 it is not what i consider to be a good distribution in its own right
4228412 slackware wasnt a good distribution for someone who wanted everything to be looked after automatically
4228413 slackware was a good distribution for those wanting extra control but only if theyre prepared to get their hands dirty
4228414 slackware was not a good distribution in its own right
4228415 and slackware will always matter as long as craftsmanship commitment and quality make a difference
4228416 there is excellent detailed well written documentation in the slackbook directory of the dvd also available online that should be more than adequate to walk a computer literate user with a modicum of experience through the process
4228417 once you start adding software from third party sources this becomes particularly messy if you dont do your homework and track down all the dependencies on your own its a recipe for dependency hell thats rarely seen on other major distributions in 2008
4228418 the comments you make about early versions of red hat linux circa 1996 1998 are certainly valid but that was a long time ago
4228419 there absolutely is extra work that you wouldnt have on slackware vis a vis dependencies
4228420 you are also correct in characterizing slackware boxes as always needing fiddling with

4228448 the negative about this weather its just a pain in the rear end
4228449 the positive is were getting a lot of throwing and catching and kicking the ball in this weather we hit two 47s 47 yard field goals at the end of practice in this weather so its a good sign
4228450 you can tell from my demeanor right now that we had a heck of a practice
4228451 that was good stuff today i heard that thunder and said here we go again and we jumped right into full contact team scrimmage situation third downs and we had two sets scripted and we went six sets and then we went to our two minute drill
4228452 our guys reacted and thats a good sign there was not complaining or whining the defensive ends were getting good pressure
4228453 ill tell you the one thing camerons doing is running the football really well
4228454 i wouldnt be surprised to see him do that in games i think he gives us that element because i think hes a very functional runner and hes very tight with the ball right now
4228455 jonathan phillips is not giving that thing up he got accepted to miami law school and we had a long discussion and he came back because he wanted a chance to kick at florida hes not done a darn thing yet but his whole approach to the game has been very impressive
4228456 i made a comment that when his foot hits the ball it sounds different from most other kickers
4228457 he hits bombs but hes also go to split the uprights with them theres a great battle going on over there
4228458 the good thing is brandon james is dynamic and theres a couple guys right behind him joe haden i watch him catch those punts and hes going to be a punt returner we got joe haden we got chris rainey louis murphys back there catching punts weve got some guys i remember my first year we had vernell brown and me it wasnt a good deal
4228459 if its not down the field then you get available underneath
4228460 and if theyre putting their man to man against you and theyre trying to match you up then you create separation and you go and you get open were an offense thats based on matchups
4228461 having a productive running back that can catch the ball and run a route helps the offense the reason you havent see them in there is because they werent productive and they didnt do their stuff the right way our guys are doing a good job with them
4228462 the things you get with tate being that second tight end compared to a ci youre dealing with a little bit of a speed difference in terms of blocking and everything else and assignments everythings still there

4228492 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4228493 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4228494 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4228495 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4228496 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4228497 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4228498 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4228499 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4228500 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4228501 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4228502 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4228503 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4228504 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4228505 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4228506 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4228507 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4228508 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4228509 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4228510 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4228511 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4228512 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4228513 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4228514 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

4228519 i almost cant believe it there were so many remix entries i did not expect anything to be honest
4228520 music is the answer has always been one of my favorite records and just to have the chance to remix it for my own pleasure was a big thing for me
4228521 but to actually win this competition is almost unreal and a huge honor
4228522 my father noticed this so he gave me two turntables a little mixer and a small drum computer for me to learn and experiment
4228523 i carefully started producing tracks with a very small set up still learning the tricks of the equipment
4228524 in a later stage of my life i did a music production course to really learn the ins and outs of studio equipment
4228525 it wasnt until 2004 when i started djing i have a weekly residency in a small club in rotterdam the netherlands
4228526 im 27 years of age now so ive been involved with music for thirteen years
4228527 currently im producing on a daily basis in my studio and doing a collaboration with dutch dj michel de hey which is rather cool as well

4228542 this was unexpected we really did not expect to see the tumor promoting activity of these creams
4228543 we thought it would be prudent to test dermabase by itself to see if it had tumor promoting activity
4228544 we did not think it would but lo and behold to our surprise we got an increased rate of skin cancer
4228545 the answer is we dont know our study raises a red flag and points out the need for epidemiologists to take a look at people who use moisturizing creams and the companies that market these products should take a look at animal models and see if their products promote tumors
4228546 this study could definitely be a warning to alert these companies to consider testing moisturizing creams with some sort of assay
4228547 these creams need to be tested first before they come to market

4228572 one day i said to myself estelle youre dumpy youre out of condition and youre also ridiculously short
4228573 we hope that the volvo product picks up between now and the first of year which it is anticipated that it will and that will sort of compensate for the mack product leaving
4228574 the thing i like most about rediscovering led zeppelin and listening to the chemical brothers and the bends is that they can no longer be comfortably accommodated into my life so much of what you consume as you get older is about accommodation i have kids and neighbors and a partner who could quite happily never hear another blues metal riff or block rockin beat in her life i have less time less tolerance for bullshit more interest in taste and more confidence in my own judgement the culture with which i surround myself is a reflection of my personality and the circumstances of my life which is in part how it should be
4228575 this was damaged to the extent that we had to replace it
4228576 this light was illuminated at the time and i thought it was quite bold that they would stand here and beat on that till they beat through a steel door
4228577 this has been replaced but it was locked with the master lock and the hasp and everything they actually cut through the hasp with the ax and busted the lock
4228578 very violated im sure its not as you would feel if it was your personal residence but i did a lot of the work on this building myself and i cant help but take it personal
4228579 in these days and times and gas you can find something a for less a bit cheaper save a little money thats good
4228580 it supports the mission of good will to help families and individuals
4228581 it also gives an option for great bargains in the community shopping from clothes to wares and to help the community have a place to go thats close and put the dollars back into the goodwill industries the store is located on melrose avenue next to the headquarters for goodwill industries of the valleys

4228589 grabbling does not require a special license in the state of mississippi other than a sport fishing license so little is known about this group of anglers
4228590 we are hoping to find grabblers to participate in the study to identify why they hand grabble for various catfishes how often they do so their attitudes toward fishing and fisheries management and how they differ from traditional hook and line recreational anglers
4228591 the information gained through this study will provide fishery managers with a better understanding of the social aspects of hand grabbling
4228592 grabblers interested in the study also are encouraged to find others to participate
4228593 replace clogged air filters to increase mileage and keep tires properly inflated to increase it by about 3 percent compared to a slightly underinflated tire
4228594 look in your manufacturers manual to see if you absolutely have to use premium grade fuel
4228595 if it only says its recommended then the lower octane is going to be ok
4228596 dont let your car idle for long periods of time especially if youre going through a drive through
4228597 if youre going to be idling for more than 30 seconds its best just to turn the engine off
4228598 driving without air conditioning would likely increase fuel usage slightly because lowering the windows would increase wind resistance
4228599 camper shells reduce wind resistance for pickup trucks and can result in better mileage
4228600 there may be carpooling information on the internet in larger cities
4228601 the hybrid systems are designed to recover energy while braking and to even out the energy demands for acceleration and in town driving
4228602 the environmental protection agency has evaluated more than 100 gas saving products and none of them significantly improve gasoline mileage
4228603 no government agency endorses any of the gas saving products
4228604 rising costs make it more difficult than ever to keep food on the table but families can take steps to ensure they are stretching their grocery dollars as far as possible
4228605 the more preparation that already has gone into a food product the more it will cost
4228606 while convenience foods are nice they cost much more and they have lots of additives and preservatives that may not be healthy
4228607 never go grocery shopping hungry and if possible leave the kids and maybe even your spouse home when you shop for food
4228608 use coupons for items you have on your list and try to shop sales for good food buys
4228609 consumers with lower incomes spend a larger portion of their income on food than do those with higher incomes but those with low incomes may receive food stamp assistance
4228610 moderate income consumers who had been making ends meet may be having the worst time now with prices rising so rapidly
4228611 just about any food can be frozen except for canned foods in the can and eggs in the shell
4228612 make sure you are freezing the food properly and using proper packaging like freezer bags or freezer containers
4228613 foods are freezer burned when they have dried out and lost flavor and nutritional value
4228614 freezer burn is caused by poor packaging and it gives food a dark color and a bad taste but it is not a food safety issue
4228615 freezer bags and storage bags are side by side in the grocery store but there is a difference
4228616 storage bags are just to store things and freezer bags are designed to protect foods in the freezer
4228617 what some of us are fighting for is to see that this oppressive system is crushed we dont care i dont care whether i will be part of the top echelon in the ruling class i am not worried about it i am dying to see a change in the system i would like to see the young people enjoying together black and white enjoying together in a new under ian douglas smith the right of all citizens to choose their leaders freely and without fear of reprisal was denied by brutal force legal shenanigans and political mechanizations under the rubrics of maintaining law and order the god given right to the enjoyment of life was severely curtailed robert gabriel mugabe inherited the very same organs that smith used to deny the people their liberty the joint operations command was not dismantled the feared central intelligence organization was kept in place ian smith needed these institutions to safeguard his unpopular minority government against a restive and disenfranchised majority out of political expedience at the time when his popularity was at its peak mugabe copied and bolstered all of smiths evil practices now we understand why he did that the good things that the udi regime did mugabes regime jettisoned why who betrayed the men and women those who selflessly paid for our yet to be fulfilled liberty with their blood sweat and tears if not the same people to whom mutambara is now trying to curry favour for self aggrandizement in another myth arthur tells us that the liberation struggle succeeded because of tactics not strategy ago being ago it takes him five hundred and sixty two words to say it this assertion is wholly without merit strategy and tactics are not mutually exclusive if anything there is a synergistic link between them tactical success or failure is a derivative of the quality of the strategy a good tactician will fail if asked to implement a bad plan planners can learn and improve based on tactical failures i will cite two examples that arthur should know during the american civil war the confederacy had a good tactician general lee however he was taking his orders from inept strategists in jefferson davis his commander in chief and judah benjamin his secretary of war lee was defeated at appomattox and surrendered without bothering to consult his civilian leaders on the other hand the union had a good strategist in abraham lincoln at the beginning of the war the inept tactician general mcclellan was leading the union army to a series of defeats lincoln fired the hapless mcclellan and replaced him with the drink soaked general grant in another example that exposes mutambaras flawed observation the zimbabwe liberation war was stalling in the early 1970s once there was solid leadership following the release of mugabe tekere zvobgo et cetera by smith the struggle gathered momentum culminating in smith conceding defeat mugabe admitted he had never fired a gun but that never negated his leadership and strategic importance on the war council dare rechimurenga there is a reason successful democracies subordinate the military to civilian leadership if there had been a feasibility study carried out before the decision to wage the armed struggle in the 1960s there would have been no liberation war if nelson mandela had done a cost benefit analysis and a net present value assessment before joining the anc or launching mk the african icon we celebrate today would not have existed

4228638 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4228639 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4228640 after the state by state roll is tallied mrs clinton is expected to turn over her cache of delegates to senator barack obama
4228641 so how will mrs clinton who is a superdelegate herself vote associates say she will throw her lot behind mr obama and ask her supporters to follow suit
4228642 there are many many fine choices senator obama can make for vp
4228643 my first choice would be senator hillary rodham clinton obviously but i have no reason to believe that will happen and i have no idea who the final choice will be
4228644 senator obamas campaign encouraged senator clintons name to be placed in nomination as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests

4228700 based on our current visibility during the olympic games for leisure travelers most of them are staying home watching games on tv
4228701 so they are delaying their trips until after olympic games for business travelers most of the companies are also delaying their meetings and conferences until after olympic games
4228702 it appears the impact from the olympic games is greater than we previously thought severe traffic controls in beijing discouraged both leisure and business travel activities
4228703 considering that management has been habitually conservative we think there is still a chance that 3q results may be better than guided
4228704 short term disruption and less favorable macro conditions will not affect ctrips long term growth on the back of its continuing market expansion and strong management execution
4228705 we suggest investors look beyond 3q to get a rational view on ctrip though we believe ctrip is working hard to mitigate the negative impact in 3q zhao wrote
4228706 we expect one time events and near term travel softness to abate toward the end of q3 and think q4 could see upside from travel plans that are delayed from q3 to q4 as chinas economy remains robust

4228714 the number of people in this country who depend on cell phones goes well into the millions
4228715 i think a great example of this is the federal excise tax that was created to help pay for the spanish american war that was only rescinded a few short years ago
4228716 the irs realized that most employers arent following those rules
4228717 and that way the tax burden shifts to the employee and the university has no exposure because were giving the employee additional wages to go out and buy their own phone
4228718 and it was pretty easy to track them because only a few people had them things have changed and the tax code needs to catch up with it

4228764 il principale scopo degli russi di cambiare il regime attuale mostrare che la russia il proprietario e che il caucaso di loro vogliono sbarrarsi del presidente saakachvili perch un capo nazionale che rifiuta di sottoporre
4228765 poutine chi ai comandi di questoperazione dice che porta la pace ma la russia ha sempre aizzato i popoli del caucaso gli uni contro gli altri
4228766 mentre ha sulla coscienza le decine di migliaia di morti della cecenia
4228767 ci che avviene oggi gli ricorda del resto molto linizio della guerra con i ceceni in cui allinizio nessuno poteva credere il che arriverebbe a grozny
4228768 i russi hanno provocato questoperazione in piena estate per impedirci di entrare nella nato in dicembre prossimo ecco tutta la storia
4228769 la georgia resta il solo vero paese democratico e pro occidentale della regione una situazione che la russia non pu accettare
4228770 vogliono ritornare per ragioni psicologiche perch quelli al potere fra cui poutine non ha mai accettato il crollo dellurss ma anche per controllare le strade energetiche del caucaso del sud dove passano le sole condutture che i russi non controllano
4228771 aveva sempre svolto un ruolo molto importante e molto positivo al caucaso come fattore di progresso e di stabilit

4228773 schip and medicaid provide an important safety net for americas families especially for families with chronically ill children these programs allow kids to get the care they need so they can feel better grow stronger and thrive in school
4228774 when children who need care do not receive it their conditions worsen and are harder and more expensive to treat later because of medicaid and schip millions of kids can get regular check ups take the medications they need to stay well and see a doctor when they are sick parents of any uninsured child should find out if their family is eligible for low cost or free insurance before sending their kids back to school
4228775 i had heard of god by the hearing of the ear but now my eye sees him
4228776 its difficult at the tactical level to know each and every engagement in each town
4228777 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4228778 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4228779 i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia
4228780 we are very concerned about these reports it is a serious situation
4228781 there are more than 35 000 visits each year in the u s to emergency departments for injuries from nail guns
4228782 over the past three years we have consistently found the sequential trigger twice as safe as the more commonly used contact trip trigger
4228783 the contact trip trigger allows workers to rapidly fire the tool and more frequently results in injuries from accidental discharges double fires and ricocheting nails
4228784 we found that carpenters with more training were better equipped to handle the tool and less prone to injury carpenters were best protected when they received both classroom training and hands on instruction unfortunately most residential carpenters including immigrant workers are less likely to get training compared to the union workers we studied
4228785 there are currently no regulations that require the sequential trigger be used or that define minimal training requirements even though data suggests there should be
4228786 they could have died within months to a year or two
4228787 they direct traffic recognize when foreign invaders come into the body and they can induce formation of killer cells to go after the invader
4228788 the antibody decorates tumor cells so any passing t cell touching that cell briefly will adhere to it much longer than normal and then the whole program of cell killing is kicked off
4228789 i think its exciting that we have new tools to treat cancer
4228790 whenever you have specificity to act against the cancer cell and also solicit host systems to combat the cancer i think thats an advance
4228791 if i give this to a person with a normal immune system will i take out all the b cells
4228792 probably and you have to ask yourself what the significance of that is
4228793 patients do follow physician recommendations to exercise when instructed to and patients who follow exercise recommendations tend to have lower systolic blood pressures than those who do not
4228794 non pharmacological methods such as exercising are important in improving blood pressure control on a population level as this study looked at the cross section of the u s population
4228795 that would result in an annual reduction of stroke coronary heart disease and all cause mortality by 6 percent 4 percent and 3 percent respectively
4228796 it is thus appropriate to recommend exercise as most patients will follow their physician recommendations and this is associated with improved blood pressure control and likely a reduction in the morbidity and mortality associated with uncontrolled blood pressure
4228797 despite clinical trial evidence and national guideline recommendations for exercise counseling to be provided for patients with high blood pressure this study demonstrates that only one third of these eligible patients received exercise counseling
4228798 our country simply cannot afford to have insecure supply of electricity
4228799 we dont think banning new thermal baseload is necessary to encourage investment in renewables it is happening already one major generator with approval to build a combined cycle gas plant has shelved that in favour of massive investment in geothermal and wind power
4228800 we say trust the market a price on carbon will do the job of encouraging renewables
4228801 without these details todays announcement is simply a mandate for heavier reliance on coal and gas which is not the way of the future
4228802 i would love to be the class of olympic athletes to sweep but everything has to go right
4228803 its being said that its a little hot here so the final decision will be made after the 10 000

4228809 horses have to be just as well as any top athlete and in the same mind set as the rider on the day
4228810 every little girl that rides a showjumping pony has dreams of doing this its been an absolute dream
4228811 she didnt actually go to pony club because she was one of those kids that wanted to be jumping three feet when they were all only jumping six inches
4228812 she got a bit bored but she did loads on the hunt field she was jumping full wires when she was seven with the waikato hunt
4228813 the great thing with mountaineering is that there are no traffic cops no traffic lights is it a law that you must have a helmet when you go climbing no nothing is law you make your own rules
4228814 it takes her about 24 hours to tune out of her special work environment and then shes like everybody else
4228815 climbing a mountain is like life in general when you make a decision you must put up with the outcome good or bad
4228816 i would say that if you are able to pull off a climb on a mountain you will see personal difficulties from a distant perspective fewer and fewer pursuits in life are as creative as personally challenging and as satisfying as being in the mountains

4228834 i am confident that the concept of india that is functioning in unison in a milieu of a vast diversity will continue to define our identity
4228835 we should pause and reflect on how our conduct and our actions are promoting unity we must ask ourselves whether our actions are contributing to the strengthening of the national fabric and bringing about tolerant thinking
4228836 india has been the target of terrorist attacks for several decades
4228837 we must stand united against the threats emanating from terrorism terrorists with their disruptive agenda will never succeed in discouraging us from our resolve to build a strong india or from working with our neighbours to eliminate this menace from our region
4228838 often we are vocal about our rights but we tend to focus less on our numerous duties we have duties towards the country society and family of which we can ignore none we must remember that while discharging our duties we have an obligation to act responsibly
4228839 no one should be left behind as the nation progresses it is my wish that growth and prosperity reaches every state every district every city every town every village and every individual of the country we have attained impressive rates of growth but empowerment of all sections of society still remains unaccomplished

4228896 i got off to a great start and made tons of putts
4228897 i missed a few opportunities on the second nine but i made a birdie to finish on a high note so im very pleased this course is tough and 5 under id take that any day here
4228898 id say the difference between the back nine and the front is the greens theyre not as undulating
4228899 but i want to say i had a career putting round
4228900 i cant remember the last time i had 10 putts on nine holes thats what you need to score here
4228901 i dont think the trend of today rounds of 5 under or 4 under are going to continue the rest of the week
4228902 i dont think well see 11 under or 10 under on the very last day maybe 8 under or 7 under will win it
4228903 im pretty happy about the score because out there its pretty narrow and greens are fast and have undulations

4228908 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4228909 people who were highly anxious had raised wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4228910 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research
4228911 basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
4228912 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
4228913 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4228914 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4228915 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening
4228916 the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the nest day when least expected
4228917 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
4228918 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion
4228919 antihistimines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day people may be setting themselves up to have more persistent problems by being stressed and anxious when allergy attacks begin

4229045 t he american armed and trained georgian army swarmed into south ossetia last thursday killing an estimated 2 000 civilians sending 40 000 south ossetians fleeing over the russian border and destroying much of the capital tskhinvali
4229046 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia
4229047 the war games included a us navy supercarrier battle group an us navy expeditionary carrier battle group a royal navy carrier battle group a french nuclear hunter killer submarine plus a large number of us navy cruisers destroyers and frigates playing the
4229048 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4229049 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4229050 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4229051 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4229052 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4229053 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4229054 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4229055 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4229056 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
4229057 you have heard the statement by the u s president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia

4229132 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
4229133 an act or the commission of an act that is forbidden or the omission of a duty that is commanded by a public law and that makes the offender liable to punishment by that law
4229134 someone needs to clean up this mess that the justice department created and i dont think what mukasey is doing goes far enough
4229135 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
4229136 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
4229137 appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
4229138 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
4229139 kyle sampson jan williams and monica goodling each violated department of justice policy and federal law
4229140 we believe that rooney and ohlson had sufficient evidence for them to have realized that political or ideological affiliations played a role in the selection process and we believe that they should have brought this issue to the attention of senior leaders at the department
4229141 maneuvering around senior officials who outranked her including the departments second in command
4229142 engaged in misconduct by systematically involving politics in the hiring of immigration judges
4229143 used political affiliations to make decisions on detailee candidates to the odag
4229144 participated in those decisions when she worked in the white house presidential personnel office
4229145 used political or ideological affiliations when assessing waiver requests from interim u s attorneys in at least three cases which violated department policy and federal law and also constituted misconduct
4229146 implemented a hiring process for ijs that treated the positions as political appointments
4229147 did not find evidence to support sampsons claim that he received such advice from olc
4229148 which increased the burden on the immigration courts that were already experiencing an increased workload
4229149 in 2006 the screening committee inappropriately used political and ideological considerations to deselect many honors program and summer intern candidates
4229150 two members of the 2006 screening committee esther slater mcdonald and michael elston took political or ideological affiliations into account in deselecting candidates in violation of department policy and federal law

4229157 its fun seeing people succeed at what theyre really good at
4229158 its great for them and its fun watching their reactions whenever they win
4229159 there isnt a sport we havent tried in this family and frankly its such a blessing to have such a diversity and every child can feel special in their own little niche
4229160 plus you cant all be talented in the same thing
4229161 they learn a lot about life and about winning and losing and as long as you keep that all in perspective it can be a very healthy experience
4229162 i just love watching great competition and learning how athletes prepare themselves to be their best
4229163 she doesnt care what anyone says or thinks or whatever shes just taking the risk and god bless her shes getting the reward but she took the risk
4229164 we sincerely apologize for the error that resulted in fenway park being unavailable to host the 2009 acc baseball championship
4229165 the atlantic coast conference and its baseball championship are very important to us and we are truly sorry for this situation
4229166 its disappointing that this scheduling error has resulted in the upcoming championship not being played at fenway park but we look forward to being at fenway in 2010
4229167 in terms of this years event we are moving swiftly to find a quality venue to host one of our premiere conference championships
4229168 we look forward to bringing acc baseball to fenway and will do everything possible to make 2010 a great success
4229169 tact is the art of making guests feel at home when thats really where you wish they were
4229170 one of the secrets of life is to make stepping stones out of stumbling blocks
4229171 resolve to perform what you ought perform without fail what you resolve
4229172 once we discover how to appreciate the timeless values in our daily experiences we can enjoy the best things in life
4229173 great things are not done by impulse but by a series of small things brought together
4229174 when we do the best we can we never know what miracle is wrought in our life or in the life of another
4229175 those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize
4229176 forgiveness is the scent that the rose leaves on the heel that crushes it
4229177 let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier
4229178 the advantage of a bad memory is that one enjoys several times the same good things for the first time
4229179 opportunities are usually disguised as hard work so most people dont recognize them
4229180 remember that as a teenager you are at the last stage of your life when you will be happy to hear that the phone is for you
4229181 silence is golden when you cant think of a good answer
4229182 learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere
4229183 its how you deal with failure that determines how you achieve success
4229184 forgiveness does not change the past but it does enlarge the future
4229185 love is the master key which opens the gates of happiness
4229186 what you keep to yourself you lose what you give away you keep forever
4229187 kind words do not cost much yet they accomplish much
4229188 happiness is a butterfly which when pursued is always just beyond your grasp but which if you will sit down quietly may alight upon you
4229189 he who knows that enough is enough will always have enough
4229190 if you can organize your kitchen you can organize your life
4229191 a pleasure is not full grown until it is remembered
4229192 the human heart at whatever age opens only to the heart that opens in return
4229193 experience tells you what to do confidence allows you to do it
4229194 the achievement of your goal is assured the moment you commit yourself to it
4229195 common sense is the knack of seeing things as they are and doing things as they ought to be done
4229196 the difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a persons determination
4229197 what we hope ever to do with ease we must learn first to do with diligence
4229198 you have succeeded in life when all you really want is only what you really need
4229199 keep true never be ashamed of doing right decide on what you think is right and stick to it
4229200 to handle yourself use your head to handle others use your heart
4229201 a little nonsense now and then is cherished by the wisest men
4229202 success is liking yourself liking what you do and liking how you do it
4229203 life engenders life energy creates energy it is by spending oneself that one becomes rich
4229204 anything that is of value in life only multiplies when it is given
4229205 only passions great passions can elevate the soul to great things
4229206 cleanliness and order are not matters of instinct they are matters of education and like most great things you must cultivate a taste for them
4229207 i have witnessed the softening of the hardest of hearts by a simple smile
4229208 riches and power are but gifts of blind fate whereas goodness is the result of ones own merits
4229209 anything that has real and lasting value is always a gift from within
4229210 we could never learn to be brave and patient if there were only joy in the world
4229211 there is nothing like returning to a place that remains unchanged to find the ways in which you yourself have altered
4229212 the true test of character is how we behave when we dont know what to do
4229213 what sunshine is to flowers smiles are to humanity these are but trifles to be sure but scattered along lifes pathway the good they do is inconceivable
4229214 beauty is not in the face beauty is a light in the heart
4229215 when you can think of yesterday without regret and tomorrow without fear you are near contentment
4229216 good humor and enthusiasm should be the sunshine ahead that will keep that shadow behind
4229217 the manner of giving is worth more than the gift
4229218 enjoy the little things for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things
4229219 sometimes i would rather have people take away years of my life than take away a moment
4229220 it is difficult to give away kindness it keeps coming back to you
4229221 with ordinary talents and extraordinary perseverance all things are attainable
4229222 never measure the height of a mountain until you have reached the top then you will see how low it was
4229223 satisfaction lies in the effort not in the attainment full effort is full victory
4229224 what we love to do we find time to do

4229226 the cure for boredom is curiosity there is no cure for curiosity
4229227 it is a mistake to look too far ahead the chain of destiny can only be grasped one link at a time
4229228 reality is the leading cause of stress for those in touch with it
4229229 we come to love not by finding a perfect person but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly
4229230 ill do my dreaming with my eyes wide open and ill do my looking back with my eyes closed
4229231 im living so far beyond my income that we may almost be said to be living apart
4229232 you dont get harmony when everybody sings the same note
4229233 if we could sell our experiences for what they cost us wed all be millionaires
4229234 life consists not in holding good cards but in playing those you hold well
4229235 you cannot be lonely if you like the person youre alone with
4229236 life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit
4229237 more marriages might survive if the partners realized that sometimes the better comes after the worse
4229238 we have not in fact decided to pull out of afghanistan
4229239 we have temporarily and indefinitely suspended operations there foremost out of respect and sheer grief for the families and also obviously to protect the security of our remaining staff and to reassess what we might be able to do going forward
4229240 our staff currently are safe as safe as they can be and we are talking to communities government officials others on how we might be able to go forward but we have made no decisions now
4229241 right now we offer our deepest condolences truly i dont have words to express our grief at the loss to these families
4229242 they do need security and unfortunately its a fact of life and those that arent providing security for their workers theyre paying the price now
4229243 she was incredibly motivated she really cared about the children in the world who cant get an education because of conflict
4229244 we believed it was risky but the risks were managed
4229245 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position

4229247 council has indicated to us a go ahead from a financing point of view
4229248 fall construction is the anticipated date for the west harbour development that will be the first mega sized project that will go ahead
4229249 overall the project will have about 1500 doors its one of the largest projects between calgary and vancouver
4229250 i believe the towers are somewhat back from the lake things like shadows wind circulation around the towers its all part of the permit application and is all being considered
4229251 i think the future is calling for more increased density housing as long as its done right architecturally from what weve seen theres a lot of open space and protection of the lake and the environment so all of those things are being considered
4229252 the driver of the bus was deceased before police arrived on scene he was a caucasian male in his early to mid 60s and is believed to be from the lower mainland

4229256 then the fifth vehicle wasnt able to stop in time to avoid hitting the car in front of it and that was the first rear ender the sixth vehicle hit the fifth and that created the domino effect of one car rear ending another
4229257 i believe it was the forth and fifth vehicle which caught fire the fire department says it looks like the fuel pump in one of the vehicles got cracked during the crash and thats what started the fire
4229258 whats really amazing is no one was seriously hurt there are a few cases of whiplash but thats it there were four children in one of the vehicles which caught fire but they had all gotten out okay
4229259 drivers need to remember to leave more space between them and other vehicles so that when you come across blocked traffic you have time to stop

4229273 the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4229274 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
4229275 if on a bad day a guy gets that letter that says his tour has been extended from 12 to 15 months that could spur a quick donation and expression of anger
4229276 donating helps members of the military express their political views privately

4229313 the significant revenue growth during the quarter resulted from increased sales of our interactive content and data applications as well as from increased subscriptions to our quotestream product line
4229314 this is our 21st consecutive quarter of revenue growth reflecting the strong continuing market penetration of our full line of financial data products and the increasing depth of our data offerings which now cover over 70 exchanges worldwide
4229315 during the second quarter quotemedia continued to build on the revenue growth momentum that has been building since 2007
4229316 our second quarter was also significant in that much of the groundwork was laid for developments that are coming to fruition now

4229319 oh happy day get me to the church on time
4229320 my son hes a little bicycle mechanic hes always in the backyard and he dont recall ever seeing nobody over here
4229321 usually ive got a yard full of kids but ive never seen any of those kids come out and play
4229322 they said they had a mother and four kids and apparently theyd been kept at home and there was some abuse allegations and the dad wouldnt let them leave
4229323 just his presence alone was enough for them to comply
4229324 i want you to see this with your own eyes
4229325 if i had been arrested and hadnt done anything my first reaction would be wheres my wife and kids
4229326 in true costa style he got out of the vehicle after doing a lap to avoid us and tried to intimidate the firefighters
4229327 he was met with boos and much frank and open debate regarding the nsw wages policy and the threat to close fire stations and sack firefighters he was quite aggressive and the firefighters present were just as up front with him it was quite a spectacle
4229328 at one point he made a statement saying nsw firefighters are the best paid firefighters in the country
4229329 my 10 year old daughter then said for all to hear standing right next to him excuse me sir im only 10 years old and even i know that is a lie
4229330 costa then tried to say that that was a good line that daddy had taught her he was then booed again
4229331 were always ready to talk to workers were more than happy to talk to them about their wage claims

4229339 we have previously announced that revenue in our core business would remain steady in a range of 4 0 million to 4 5 million per quarter for the first three quarters of this year we are pleased to report that revenue for the quarter ended june 30 2008 was within this range and that revenue for the first six months of this year was also within this range in addition as we announced earlier this year we are in the process of introducing new products that we believe will help us increase our revenues by the fourth quarter of this year i am pleased to announce that we have added several significant products already this year
4229340 while we are always pleased to have large sales such as the sale to the u s army which occurred in 2007 we believe that our core business will continue to grow particularly as our new products gain market acceptance
4229341 natural products expo east is creating a green event that has a broad and thoughtful array of environmentally friendly practices
4229342 by doing so they are demonstrating the kinds of practices that are very important to our future
4229343 by partnering with the boston convention and exhibition center our trade show vendors and our exhibitors this years show will prove to be our greenest yet and will set the standard for improvement in the years to come
4229344 all these workers are asking for is family health care coverage and a wage that will make it a bit easier for them to provide for their families
4229345 the aerospace industry is making billions of dollars but those of us who clean their buildings are barely surviving

4229349 the additional security speed and phone line consolidation help retailers make the most of their investment today and builds infrastructure for future enhancements
4229350 cybera is focused on superior application delivery through implementation on going performance and ultimately support

4229353 this honorable distinction as a top company finalist signifies our success in our mission to honor the gift of tissue donation by responsibly processing and distributing life saving and life enhancing human allograft tissue for our communities
4229354 although we have not yet seen the text of the joint business agreement todays announcement is problematic on several fronts
4229355 for example the scope clause in our current collective bargaining agreement does not include an exception for a joint business agreement between american airlines and another airline management therefore needs apas consent before this joint business agreement can go forward
4229356 todays announcement illustrates that american airlines management can negotiate complex agreements on a timely basis when they want to do so
4229357 its indicative of managements misplaced priorities that they arent willing to apply the same sense of urgency toward negotiating new collective bargaining agreements with their employees
4229358 moreover it seems to us that management should focus first on running a more reliable operation before embarking on a new venture of this magnitude and complexity
4229359 our airline unfortunately continues to lag the industry to an embarrassing degree in key customer service metrics such as on time performance
4229360 that said we understand clearly why the other carriers would want to link up with american airlines the u s aviation market is the worlds largest and most lucrative
4229361 and thats precisely why we have such serious concerns apa agrees with both john mccain and barack obama we oppose any scheme that jeopardizes american jobs
4229362 make no mistake we want american airlines to succeed but that success cannot come at the expense of the employees
4229363 we have serious job security concerns that must be addressed as part of any revenue producing agreement with another airline
4229364 as with all international mail operators the high fuel surcharges imposed by the airlines during the second quarter could not be immediately passed along to our contracted mail clients
4229365 with the increase in fuel surcharges upwards of 30 we are exploring ways to recover some of these incredibly high surcharges which have been unprecedented in our industry
4229366 we anticipate being able to substantially grow skypostal in the second half through several targeted acquisitions introduction of service to europe introduction of new mailing solutions to lac for internet marketers and the roll out of our gps pda units which will provide skypostal with a decidedly unique advantage over the state owned public postal networks by offering automatic confirmation of delivery on mail at a fraction of the cost charged by express operators

4229380 i believe that is a definite risk for dion right now
4229381 especially in this weakening economy people need to know and hear that theres some plan for the economy
4229382 right now conservatives are very solid in a whole bunch of areas and thats almost a surrogate for leadership thats why it really will come down to the campaign
4229383 our 3g chips are for example used in samsung handsets and we are not aware of such problems there
4229384 one source says apple programmed the infineon chip to demand a more powerful 3g signal than the iphone really requires so if too many people try to make a call or go on the internet in a given area some of the devices will decide theres insufficient power and switch to the slower network even if there is enough 3g bandwidth available
4229385 initiative will highlight and encourage discussion among millions about 100 of the most innovative and world changing ideas to take root in the city since katrina

4229398 if any city in america deserves the title of home of the beat generation it is san francisco although new york can rightly boast to be the birthplace of the beats the literary group came to maturity and national prominence in this most beautiful city by the bay in the 1950s san francisco was a magnet attracting inventive writers artists and thinkers during the conservative postwar years intellectual freedom blossomed with the publication and trial of howl and by the 1960s san francisco was the destination of choice for a new generation of radical innovators

4229425 today was a culmination of the hard work we have put in the last one year and the team deserved the win
4229426 tonight it was not about tactics but about the desire to win the team showed a lot of character and since we took a big lead very early in the game we had a tough time defending as tajikistan threw everything at us
4229427 we can carry on with our systematic preparations for three years

4229437 theres no need for people to be fearful of the people who were associated with this particular crime
4229438 but people should continue with the normal amount of vigilance lock your homes when you are inside or out the back and lock up at night normal routine security this particular crime doesnt change that advice
4229439 we are seeking as much information as we can possibly get

4229678 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
4229679 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
4229680 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
4229681 these proposed additions to delawares tidal and non tidal fishing regulations will allow us to meet these new federal requirements with no additional cost to our anglers
4229682 the federal national marine fisheries service has been tasked to identify saltwater anglers for survey purposes if we can provide a complete registry of delawares marine recreational fishermen from our state issued fishing license program our anglers will be exempt from participating in the federal registry and federal license fees
4229683 under the new regulations the first question we would ask our license applicants is fresh salt or both presently we have no way to determine this and the fisheries service is only looking for saltwater angler information

4229690 id never seen a hyperlink before and it was kind of drop dead amazing
4229691 i sure would switch but adobe photoshop autocad runs on windows
4229692 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4229693 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4229694 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4229695 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4229696 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4229697 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4229698 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4229699 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4229700 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4229701 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4229702 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4229703 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4229704 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4229705 thats right not just one but two opportunities to see previously unseen gameplay footage and get new information about the force unleashed and the upcoming demo this thursday august 14th x play on g4 reports direct from lucasarts and devotes an entire show to the force unleashed lots of new gameplay some new revelations and perhaps more importantly wall to wall morgan webb then this friday august 15th gametrailers tv on spike has a big reveal about the force unleashed and even more new footage check it out at midnight and then at gametrailers com i promise by the end of this week youll know everything you need to know about the demo

4229708 this was a direct reflection of how the market has changed
4229709 chrysler how dare you idle st louis and continue to run three shifts in canada
4229710 the way it is now these younger people will never be able to own a home or buy a decent vehicle
4229711 the st louis facilities were opened to support growing demand
4229712 my view is that the russians and i would say principally prime minister vladimir putin is interested in reasserting russia s
4229713 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russia relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4229714 in the days and weeks ahead the defense department will re examine the entire gamut of our military to military activities with russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian actions
4229715 i have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust i think you make national security policy based on interests and realities
4229716 this year it escalated very quickly and it seemed to me that the russians were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively
4229717 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west economically politically and in security arrangements
4229718 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the longtime russian sphere of influence
4229719 i don t see any prospect for the use of military force in this situation
4229720 we do seem to be busy with other things so there is a question of resources but at the same time i think that it s
4229721 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4229722 as soon as the plane did something that i knew link wasn t doing i said we gotta get out
4229723 we didn t have control of anything we were along for the ride
4229724 it felt like the plane was going to crash i remember looking at my hands and saying you ve got to be kidding me i put my head back closed my eyes and pulled as hard as i could
4229725 it was a plane and it wasn t working right
4229726 airplane was doing exactly what it was supposed to be doing
4229727 that s the crazy thing it was just a matter of bad data in bad data out i have so much faith in the b 2 as a plane that it hasn t thrown me off my game
4229728 it was a teary eyed moment for both of us
4229729 it s something that not many people in my career field ever get to experience when a plane goes down everybody usually dies you don t hear about a good ejection very often

4229736 who has truly abused the system and said libelous things for years now the only way to get him is to step outside the box

4229742 the whole of life is only a swan song never forget those lines the lion when stricken to the heart gives out his mightiest roar when smitten on the head the cobra lifts its hood and the majesty of the soul comes forth only when a man is wounded to his depths i shall now recount one or two incidents to illustrate the swamis deep love and reverence for swami vivekananda once when i was staying at the advaita ashrama gangadhar maharaj was for some time at the kolkata residence of the rani of puntia whose grandsons were the disciples of swami saradananda a devotee who was staying for one or two days at advaita ashrama spent a little money and fed the monastics with rasagollas and green coconuts during the noon meal as we finished our meal a monk arrived from the udbodhan he too had a share of sweets and coconuts later he met gangadhar maharaj and said to him maharaj today there was a sumptuous feast at the advaita ashrama there were plenty of rasagollas what to speak of green coconuts and then he added maharaj you are here and there was such a big feast at advaita ashrama and they did not invite you on hearing this the swami said like a boy how strange i am here so near and prabhu did not invite me wait let him come the monk came back and said to me i have lodged a big complaint with maharaj against you wait when you meet him this time you will see the fun a few days later i went to visit gangadhar maharaj after i saluted him and sat at his feet the grandchildren of the rani of puntia and one or two monks among whom was the one who had reported against me all sat down there eager to see what would transpire gangadhar maharaj sat very grave uttering not a word i too kept mum after a while he said shaking his index finger at me i have something to say against you i too have something to say against you i replied what have you got to say against me please tell me first what you have to say after looking into your charge sheet i shall speak out what i have to say then fix up a judge said gangadhar maharaj like a little boy you will be the best judge i said how can i be the judge when i have brought an accusation against you i have faith in you only rather than in anyone else present here well then let it be so then he said you had such a big feast over there and i am staying so near yet you did not care to invite me it was not really a feast maharaj i said and then i explained the whole matter to him finally i added this monk here has for nothing reported to you against me and you too expressed a grievance without enquiring from me what actually had happened swamiji has said if anyone is at fault call him and speak to him dont tell anything to anyone else

4229785 rumors have been circulating around capitol hill that a few activist groups have renewed their surge and have begun lobbying full force for a bill introduced by presidential candidate sen barack obama d il the bill has already passed out of the senate foreign relations committee without any public hearings and it also passed the house earlier this year it is important to note that both of these votes were voice votes which was a deliberate strategy of the congressional majority so that no record would be kept of those who voted in favor of this problematic bill
4229786 while senator barack obama struggles to keep the public in the dark about the nature of his pro u n global poverty act a recent bay area interfaith leaders luncheon was held to lobby for senate passage of the bill whose cost has been estimated at 845 billion
4229787 meanwhile a concerned parent alerted us to the fact that a christian preschool in long island new york was handing out a coloring page for children which included a plea for congress to pass obamas global poverty act
4229788 the enclosed sheet said dear senator at preschool i learned to thank god for the food i eat
4229789 the pictures to be colored included what appeared to be an angel holding a bowl of food with a valentine heart on the robe and the bowl and a basket with apples
4229790 this amounts to a tax of over 2 000 on each man woman and child in the united states the foreign aid budget now stands at 300 billion the act would add the additional expenditure to the already huge amount allocated to assist the world
4229791 through a global tax preferably on carbon emitting fossil fuels
4229792 we will need in the end to put real resources in support of our hopes a global tax on carbon emitting fossil fuels might be the way to begin

4229808 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4229809 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4229810 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4229811 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4229822 its a huge situation for me after 35 years because ive wanted to bring one back
4229823 this whole thing unfolded about two weeks ago when these two boys came on a talk show here in the states and announced theyd found a bigfoot body
4229824 the commentator asked them if they could send someone to see the body and they said the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body is the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
4229825 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there
4229826 i got to be honest when i first saw it i hated to see it in that state it was in i wanted to capture one so the world could see it walking i guess this is the next best thing for the time being
4229827 we trekked in for a day a half what kind of lunatic would be out here in a monkey suit i saw the thing i touched it
4229828 theyre fine guys one works for the police department in georgia and the other was a correctional officer theyre pretty credible guys
4229829 well release the dna analysis and well have the body right next to the two boys then you can see its real that its not all bullshit
4229830 as long as his part time business doesnt affect his work ethic
4229831 his claims of finding bigfoot is entirely a different matter unfortunately thats spilling over into his police life and thats where we have concerns when he comes back from medical leave well have to sit down and address those issues

4229857 energy prices do seem to be coming down a bit so im hopeful that going forward we wont see as much of an increase
4229858 that decline will translate into lower gasoline prices and lower prices across the board
4229859 now that the tidal surge in energy and other commodity costs is showing unmistakable signs of turning up in consumer prices at large the fed finds itself pushed further into the corner
4229860 the recent report on retail sales coupled with todays report indicates that a dip in real consumer spending is now underway
4229861 consumers are trying to scrimp and save and they have to because their incomes are not going up
4229862 in fact they are not even running in place they are moving backward
4229863 whats happened in the last 40 50 years is that human activity has made the water quality conditions worse
4229864 dead zones tend to occur in areas that are historically prime fishing grounds
4229865 there are large areas of the gulf where you cant catch any shrimp
4229866 the overwhelming response of the organisms in our coastal areas is to migrate or to die
4229867 to adapt to low oxygen water it has to be a part of your evolutionary history its not something you can develop in a 40 or 50 year time period
4229868 they have major consequences for the ability of fish populations to renew themselves
4229869 but its one of the major problems we face in terms of the health of coastal ecosystems
4229870 we would prefer no more reductions but we must keep expenses in line with revenue

4229875 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4229876 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4229877 put the middle class ahead of corporate interests end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas cut taxes for working families and make energy independence an urgent national priority

4229879 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4229880 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying
4229881 he walked around an employee walked in and did meet mr gwatney
4229882 they introduced themselves at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times he then turned and left the business
4229883 she was saying that somebody was in her office shooting a gun and she didnt know if he had been hit
4229884 she was just screaming so we got her behind the counter and locked the door because we didnt know if someone was following her
4229885 she said he didnt scare me he was puzzling to me for some reason and i was trying to get rid of him
4229886 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4229887 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
4229888 his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time
4229889 the united states is now accepting musharrafs removal as a fait accompli
4229890 they just want that he should not be humiliated we dont want his humiliation either
4229891 they are saying if you do it according to the book its none of our business they have pushed against musharraf
4229892 with one voice they said this is the time you have to be with the democratic forces
4229893 but no one is actually in the mood to see what it is going to be like to be in the post musharraf era
4229894 we very very strongly feel it has to be a man of national consensus a man of stature a man everyone looks up to as a head of state
4229895 we see them generally complying and moving back to a position where they can make their exit
4229896 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
4229897 it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4229898 we will support any decision made by the people of south ossetia and abkhazia
4229899 i dont know how they are going to isolate us
4229900 i have heard threats that we are not going to be admitted to the world trade organization but we see clearly that nobody is going to admit us there anyway
4229901 we regret that the u s still refuses to admit the real cause for what happened which is that georgian president mikheil saakashvilis regime in violation of all its international obligations unleashed a war against the people of south ossetia
4229902 this is an important signal the u s will keep georgian airport and seaports open
4229903 the first plane landed and thats a turning point this is an operation led by the pentagon
4229904 they are there to neutralize a huge arsenal of arms and military hardware which they found there totally abandoned it was necessary to neutralize them in order not to create a threat for civilians
4229905 numerous houses in the villages of kekhvi nizhnie achaveti verkhnie achaveti and tamarasheni had been burnt down over the last day
4229906 saw the smoldering remnants of the houses and household items the villages were virtually deserted with the exception of a few elderly and incapacitated people who stayed behind either because they were unable to flee or because they were trying to save their belongings and cattle
4229907 when we challenged them on this the russians told us that they dont control everything yet

4229921 when it was motionless it was actually towed to the bay
4229922 this is what i would put in the context of yet another flat battery or flat tyre

4229924 anytime race is the topic du jour in the campaign its a bad day for obama period

4229926 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4229927 buyers see and hear stories about the collapse of the national housing market everywhere and that makes them afraid to move forward with a purchase
4229928 much of the savings in prices was consumed by higher interest rates leaving buyers frustrated that they are not benefitting from price declines as they expected
4229929 we have reached a deal with the united states on the shield
4229930 our key demand the presence of patriots has been accepted by the americans
4229931 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4229932 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4229933 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4229934 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4229935 to honour and celebrate these voices and votes both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4229936 senator obamas campaign encouraged senator clintons name to be placed in nomination as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4229937 senator obama and senator clinton are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee and to victory this fall for america
4229938 after the state by state roll is tallied mrs clinton is expected to turn over her cache of delegates to senator barack obama
4229939 so how will mrs clinton who is a superdelegate herself vote associates say she will throw her lot behind mr obama and ask her supporters to follow suit
4229940 we had a hail storm that hurt us really bad two years ago
4229941 residual security arrangements that the russians would be able to maintain
4229942 critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4229943 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4229944 the whole thing was going to be determined at this sadc summit
4229945 we were all scheduled to go and meet with the troika the sadc organ on politics and defence
4229946 as everyone is aware for any foreign travel one needs travel documents and mr tsvangirai does not currently have any such documents
4229947 there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
4229948 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
4229949 would be accommodated in the new government when he was ready to sign
4229950 a financial settlement is going to be found at the beginning of next week

4229952 we were looking forward to seeing him play toulouse used their best players against us
4229953 profound implications for our security relationship going forward not only bilaterally but with nato
4229954 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4229955 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4229956 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4229957 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4229958 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4229959 we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4229960 and so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4229961 our early comments were make sure that the airports are available to us the roads are available to us and the seaports available to us so thats the assessment thats going on during this 48 hours
4229962 were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively that went far beyond just re asserting the autonomy of abkhazia and or their view of the autonomy of abkhazia and south ossetia but to punish georgia
4229963 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the long time russian sphere of influence
4229964 i have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust i think you make national security policy based on interests and on realities
4229965 the secretary general is extremely concerned by the impact of the recent conflict on the civilian population in georgia which has suffered loss of life and injury significant damage to civilian property and infrastructure as well as sizeable displacement
4229966 the critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
