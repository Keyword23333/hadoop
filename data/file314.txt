3140025 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
3140026 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
3140027 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade

3140077 kami memprotes dpt itu bukan karena takut kalah tapi kami melihat ada proses yang tidak jujur di dalamnya dan kami wajib meluruskan agar pilkada tidak tercederai oleh tindakan tindakan yang menodai proses demokrasi karena itu kami menolak hasil tersebut

3140079 one of our bedrock privacy principles is transparency by which we mean that we are upfront with our users about what information we collect and how we use it so that they can make informed choices about their personal information
3140080 ensuring that we earn and keep our users trust is an essential constant for building the best possible products
3140081 with every google product we work hard to earn and keep that trust with a long standing commitment to protect the privacy of our users personal information
3140082 both last octet of the ip address and the full unique cookie id
3140083 used in association with other information to identify an individual
3140084 we also believe that a strong and easy to find mechanism to permit consumers to opt out of this type of data collection is a goal that all companies should aspire to achieve
3140085 opt out mechanisms for online advertising are often buried in fine print difficult to understand hard to execute and technically inadequate
3140086 moreover in most cases opt out mechanisms offered for behavioral advertising only opt a user out of receiving targeted ads but do not opt the user out of data collection about his or her internet usage
3140087 individual web sites and search engines and their affiliates that monitor users also owe consumers constructive notice of such activities and the right to limit or thwart any personal data collection

3140096 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3140097 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3140098 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3140099 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them

3140118 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3140119 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3140120 its quite possible that they will use this was support for their case but one cant determine that because a species is under less threat from extinction that its automatically okay to start hunting them

3140160 however it has no significant impact on russias economic fundamentals and corporate earnings and at the end of the day we firmly believe this is what ultimately drives the markets rather then emotions and swings in investor sentiment

3140185 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3140186 both the fungus and the birds eat chilies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
3140187 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3140188 having such a specific defense one that doesnt harm reproduction or dispersal is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant and i think it is a great example of the power of natural selection
3140189 by contrast peppers increase their chemical defense levels or their heat as they ripen this is a very different model and peppers can get away with it because birds dont sense pain when they eat capsaicin
3140190 i think a lot of plants would love to come up with this way of stopping fungal growth without inhibiting dispersers its just very hard to do
3140191 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3140192 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3140193 in the north any adaptive benefit to using eating chilies would be much smaller than at the equator because microbial infection of food is less common and its easier to keep food cold maybe thats why food in the north can be so boring
3140194 along the equator without access to refrigeration you could be dead pretty quickly unless you can find a way to protect yourself against the microbes you ingest every day

3140479 we therefore made a decision to drastically minimize sales of weapons to georgia

3140810 we must respect our differences without restrictions or red lines
3140811 all parties know the meaning of resistance we all have martyrs in the name of all martyrs let us reach an agreement within the framework of the state
3140812 the right of lebanons people armed forces and resistance to liberate or reclaim the israeli occupied shebaa farms kafar shuba hills and the lebanese section of ghajar village and defend lebanon using all legal and possible means
3140813 the cabinet will win a vote of confidence in parliament but the lebanese people alone can grant it true confidence based on its performance
3140814 formulate the national strategy for youth and sport for the next ten years
3140815 the establishment of diplomatic ties between damascus and beirut and the opening of embassies in each others countries for the first time in their history will be at the center of the discussions
3140816 there will be coordination between the two countries embassies and the council
3140817 will broaden the horizons for lebanese syrian relations and allow for a diplomatic exchange between the two countries
3140818 an agreement concerning the detainees and missing in syria will be reached through the syrian lebanese higher council slhc
3140819 president sleiman however wants a clear definition of the councils mission and tasks so they dont overlap with those of the future syrian and lebanese ambassadors
3140820 the names of the ambassadors will soon be made public before modifying the 40 treaties and agreements signed between lebanon and syria
3140821 most of the children come from extremely underprivileged homes and diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds a mix of lebanese palestinian iraqi muslim and christian kids creates the unique atmosphere of this summers camp we want to expose the kids to a healthier and happier environment
3140822 this is the way to teach children important life skills like work ethics and team work
3140823 non violence is a must to build peace lets get started here and right now
3140824 at the beginning many children are homesick and cry but by the end of the two weeks most just want to stay
3140825 it is the most intense and perhaps the best experience of my life
3140826 its frustrating to learn about abuse and not be able to report it for lack of proof
3140827 there are a number of potential reasons why proton pump inhibitors might have this effect but we need to do further research to answer those questions
3140828 someone might have very mild heartburn that could easily be managed with other medications such as tums or zantac who are prescribed a proton pump inhibitor
3140829 and then it works but no one ever thinks of stepping down the therapy
3140830 and there are a lot of people we know who arent on these medications
3140831 however there are also people who get prescribed these medications and dont know why there is obviously appropriate use but there is inappropriate overuse and inappropriate underuse
3140832 im comfortable at this point with saying if youre only going to be on this medication a short time dont worry if youre going to be on it a long time the jurys still out as to what you should do
3140833 if youre on one of these medications and think you may be at risk for osteoporosis or you have osteoporosis or youve had a fracture in the past its a good time for you to make an appointment with your doctor to discuss why youre on these medications
3140834 au inceput sa arunce cu pietre in masina si sa dea cu bate in geamuri apoi s au urcat pe capota am reusit sa scapam cu greu dupa ce am mers mai bine de 100 de metri cu spatele printre carute si rromi
3140835 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time
3140836 survivors reported that coalition aircraft dropped a bomb on the enemy position which killed eight of the civilians
3140837 an anonymous eyewitness told coalition forces the civilians tried to escape the compound but the militants beat them and refused to let them leave
3140838 a convoy of vehicles was attacked by a suicide bomber i believe it hit one of the vehicles in the convoy it is an armored vehicle
3140839 we carried out the suicide bombing in kabul against foreign forces
3140840 an icrc assessment team that managed to visit the georgian town of gori has confirmed that many people have fled we are also hearing reports of widespread displacement throughout the region
3140841 this provocation was aimed at occupying south ossetia abkhazia and then all of georgia
3140842 about 30 minutes into the flight and 90 kilometers northwest of geneina in west darfur the pilot heard shots being fired
3140843 now that the united states is involved it should stay involved with the full strength of our diplomacy
3140844 america has no other choice but to leave the middle east region beaten and humiliated
3140845 we had an overt policy that was one of negotiation and confidence building
3140846 and a covert policy that was continuation of our nuclear activities
3140847 prove to the entire world that we want the power plants for electricity but afterward we can continue with other activities
3140848 as long as we were not subjected to sanctions and during our negotiations we could import technology
3140849 we should have negotiated for so long and benefited from the atmosphere of negotiations to the extent that we could import all the technology we needed
3140850 the two sides agreed to continue talks in a constructive atmosphere
3140851 solana and jalili voiced satisfaction at the constructive trend of negotiations in geneva and the contacts afterward
3140852 theyve deeply understood that irans peaceful nuclear program will never be halted and of course they have no choice but to keep on talking to iran
3140853 despite threats and sanctions by a number of big powers our nation is robust and is continuing to live its own life as they cannot put obstacles in the path of our progress
3140854 this visit will open a new page in relations between the two countries which will help to maintain the stability and security in iraq and all the region
3140855 renewed his support to the iraqi government and his support for the efforts to spread security stability and reconstruction
3140856 iraqi and jordanian officials should exchange visits after this trip to discuss mechanisms for boosting bilateral relations in various fields and serve the interests of jordan and iraq
3140857 uniting sunni shiite and kurdish political powers is the only way to build a unified and sovereign iraq that would be capable of serving its people and the arab nation

3140862 we woke up from a coma to see a monocolored flag of hamas do away with the four color flag of palestine
3140863 we have triumphed gaza won its independence from the west bank one people now have two states prisons who dont greet each other we have triumphed knowing that it is the occupier who really won
3140864 in primele doua trei minute nu am simti nimic neobisnuit insa cand au trecut cinci am inceput sa simt cum imi arde carnea pe mine credeti ma iti trebuie vointa de fier ca sa rezisti intr o astfel de atmosfera
3140865 sunt foarte fericita ca am rezistat mai mult cu o secunda decat natalia si astfel am castigat concursul pentru ca ea era una dintre principalele favorite

3140867 id prefer the plain stuff although the coloring is kind of cool
3140868 looking like fruity pebbles tasting more like sour patch kids
3140869 as someone who inhabits a small new york city apartment
3140870 i am terrified of anything with fur or more legs than me that also wants to call my place home and these harry potter creepy crawlers look dark and imposing with a squishy center beady black eyes and dangling antennas
3140871 its a combination of a gumball and a piece of licorice all in the shape of a cockroach
3140872 its more like grape flavored gummy goodness than crunchy bug guts
3140873 the pear and the grape just tasted like you tried to chew that flavor of bubblegum and eat a chocolate m amp m at the same time
3140874 not even the feather can make this candy look any less inappropriate
3140875 id rather take my chances of a bag of bertie botts every flavor beans than willfully eat watermelon flavored candy
3140876 fortunately for candy fans the wrapper should prevent any confusion
3140877 if you like marshmallow fluff mixed with toothpaste and covered in a thin layer of chocolate then you would love peppermint toads
3140878 this one i have to say is a big disappointment at least thematically
3140879 why on earth does it taste like a giant grape gumball
3140880 it tasted a lot better than you would think unicorn s would taste like
3140881 its horrible when you first put it in your mouth but when you bite its magic
3140882 they taste like sour patch kids but with not as much bite
3140883 if i ever decide to eat anything from unicorns or droppings of any kind i would hope they taste like these
3140884 but instead tastes like a rare blend of strawberry coconut paste
3140885 crumbly super sugary and inexplicably pink stuff binding the cube together
3140886 the latest developments such as the crossing of the georgian borders by russian troops change the dimension of the conflict
3140887 we therefore call upon russia to stop immediately all military activity on georgian territory

3140891 we come here as slaves all of us slaves of the sultan we give up everything even our names it is a strange fact dont you think that not one of us was born ottoman or even a muslim not one of us there is nothing to unite us except the fact that we have the honour to be the sultans women and do not forget this there is no higher honour
3140892 a rare glimpse into the forbidden confines of the sultans harem
3140893 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3140894 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3140895 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3140896 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3140897 people have always been fascinated by how some trees such as douglas fir or redwoods can grow so tall
3140898 this is not an easy thing to do think about trying to drink water through a narrow 350 foot long straw it takes a lot of suction
3140899 more efficiently and avoid misusing it to regulate global climate change
3140900 it means that well likely see vegetation shift a lot faster than we might think
3140901 the plant death was striking and occurred in most species
3140902 the occurrence of plant death was obvious to everyone living in that area
3140903 drought certainly stands out as a real likely explanation it is an extremely severe event
3140904 to be in prison for 18 years for something you didnt do and then know you are going to walk out of court a free man thats a lot to take in in one day
3140905 if my child acts like that i will just spank him and make him mind me she needs to show him who is in control

3140912 its such a peculiar thing happening so its probably the same person
3140913 it is time our politicians understood that caring for children is work and that caring for them without a partner and on a woefully inadequate benefit is very hard work indeed
3140914 the proposal to shift the abatement threshold to 100 is welcome but doesnt go far enough
3140915 if you are expecting people to work for 15 hours then it would seem logical that the threshold should be 15 hours at the minimum wage or 180 as things stand sole parents face a marginal tax rate of 50 percent on every dollar they earn over 100 and 90 percent on earnings of over 180
3140916 long term welfare dependency locks people into a life of limited income and limited choices
3140917 were really indicating that those people are the ones we are going to encourage to undertake 15 hours part time work or training or be at least looking for work

3140940 vastasena m ratlevad nad venemaad ja on impeeriumi k itumisest okeeritud
3140941 eeldame et nato peaks kinnitama veel kord oma toetust gruusia suver nsusele ja territoriaalsele terviklikkusele samuti peaks nato n udma vaenutegevuse viivitamatut l petamist ja k ikide vene v e ksuste viivitamatut v ljaviimist gruusia territooriumilt
3140942 t en oliselt on m tet elda v lja et gruusia on endiselt partnerriik ja kandidaatriik ning tegevus tema teel nato suunas j tkub
3140943 el peaks tegutsema kiirelt ja otsustavalt ning el i n htavus selle konflikti puhul peaks ilmselgelt kasvama
3140944 el peaks hukka m istma venemaa s jalise agressiooni gruusia vastu ja n udma selle viivitamatut l petamist

3140946 aga kui agressioon on toimunud siis peavad sellel olema ka j reldused tegemist on teistsuguse olukorraga ja teistsuguse riigiga venemaa on teatavasti nato s strateegiline partner kuid kas saab olla selline strateegiline partner kes kasutab agressiooni naaberriigi m jutamiseks

3141055 this appeared to clear humans of any involvement in the disappearance of the islands large megafauna
3141056 ever since charles darwins discovery of giant ground sloth remains in south america debate has ensued about the cause of early extinction of the worlds megafauna
3141057 it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
3141058 they typically have a similar megafauna and climate to neighbouring continental landmasses but human arrival was often delayed
3141059 the tasmanian results echo those on mainland australia putting humans squarely back in the frame as the driving force behind megafaunal extinction
3141060 although fuel cells can be used to power things a camera is not a thing hence this crap is patentable
3141061 as a patent examiner im not allowed to post my opinion of patentability but i will say that most cases are heavily modified from their original application form as this one is in now
3141062 the patent covers other electronic devices generally but is clearly directed toward dslr cameras given the diagrams and examples used

3141083 i dont need more ram ive got an external hard drive with 500gb of memory
3141084 yes but its a different type of memory the ram is what the pc uses to process stuff and the hard drive is what it uses to store stuff
3141085 why cant it use the memory on the external hard drive to process stuff
3141086 i always think just because you are allowed to do something does not mean you should necessarily do it if you impose a few restrictions on yourself it forces you to come up with cleverer ways to get round things
3141087 bbc3 wants to be a young persons channel and they think the way to do that is to be as risky as they can i just never ever watch bbc3 i dont think it is tuned in on my tv it is tv that further polarises and atomises audiences there is that kind of tv where your dad has to leave the room every ten minutes because he is too embarrassed to watch i want to avoid that
3141088 there is a way to talk about taboo subjects and adult subjects without making people feel like they need a bath seinfeld does it the simpsons does it always in such a clever way and that is what you should be aiming for
3141089 that is what i am depressed about at the moment the kind of charmlessness of most comedy on television

3141097 the attack vector is not new but simply a repeat of dans work to a much higher degree of speed
3141098 add s mathematical difficulty of a brute force attempt essentially making the attack take so long that it would be unreasonable to be successful
3141099 for example if in 20 years that secure credit card transaction you made over the internet was hacked it would be rather useless to the attacker
3141100 by adding more randomization in dns just like with cryptography by the time someone breaks in it would be too late anyway

3141115 he started thinking more and more about the off time the family a lot of people dont know but he was very involved with charitable organizations skip is a private man a charitable man and yet he can tell a joke like anybody
3141116 i think most people underestimated his intelligence because a lot of his humor went right over their heads but he had a good time with it it was his spirit and that kind of humor has to be coming from somone who is very very intelligent
3141117 first thing was have you heard this one because he enjoyed telling a joke enjoyed hearing a good joke and was just so much more than a broadcaster

3141145 el mas cree que estas decisiones no tienen legitimidad social ni legalidad esas decisiones se est n haciendo al margen de lo que las grandes mayor as hoy piensan y son decisiones que buscan seguir acorralando y desmoralizando a una sociedad que tiene antecedentes positivos de que quiere que en venezuela se produzcan cambios pero que se produzcan dentro del marco de las leyes

3141150 this is telling you that being a runner being active is going to reduce your disability and its going to increase your survival
3141151 late in life you still see the benefit of vigorous activity
3141152 illness would be compressed between later age of onset and age of death and that paradigm was controversial because it went against conventional wisdom and had no proof
3141153 running delayed the onset of disability by an average of 16 years and that is largely a conservative number because the control group was pretty darn healthy
3141154 i always thought that the two curves would start to parallel each other and that eventually aging would overpower exercise
3141155 i think that will happen but we cant find even a little twitch toward that gap narrowing in the present time
3141156 vigorous activity has a really dramatic impact but we cant ignore that there are also helpful benefits to people who are active at all levels meaning those people who are just out walking
3141157 its so important to be physically active your whole life not just in your 20s or 40s but forever
3141158 exercise is like the most potent drug exercise is by far the best thing you can do
3141159 at 19 years 15 percent of runners had died compared with 34 percent of controls
3141160 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se
3141161 it is the regular physical vigorous activity that is important
3141162 over time all groups decreased running activity but the runners groups continued to accumulate more minutes per week of vigorous activity of all kinds
3141163 members of the running groups had significantly lower mean disability levels at all time points
3141164 almost all of them did something else they continued their vigorous exercise
3141165 i learned a lot of stuff out here today keep my hips square because im used to corner and open up the hips
3141166 basically open up the hips its allowed me to be a more athletic linebacker now coach strong was basically teaching me today to keep my hips square stay on the inside and wait for them to make a move and run with them
3141167 my dad still wants me to visit some more schools so then i can start putting those schools in order
3141168 ever since i came here last year i always liked it here last year was my first time visiting a college campus besides bethune cookman my dads school im kind of used to smaller colleges so when i came here and saw the stadium and saw three or four games this year i see what its like to be on a big campus
3141169 if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
3141170 the health benefits of exercise are greater than we thought
3141171 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3141172 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3141173 its quite possible that they will use this was support for their case but one cant determine that because a species is under less threat from extinction that its automatically okay to start hunting them
3141174 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting

3141178 ceasefire agreement is signed by two sides when they meet
3141179 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia

3141188 it appears that the more that obama speaks the more afraid folks in south carolina get
3141189 we are seeing die hard democrats tell us that obama is not their man
3141190 we are expecting the white democrats to be fleeing the democratic ship when november 4 comes around plus the democratic candidate bob conley that is running against senator lindsey graham is also running away from the democrats and you can quote me on that

3141274 life sure has changed for obediah since he hooked up with that pretty young filly
3141275 i doth believe jonathan hath misunderstood what a jackass pulling contest means
3141276 actually 69 years is a ripe old age for someone with all those maladies

3141278 i still think she was a hypochndriac with her poor eyesight she just didnt see the train coming
3141279 i guess we should have believed her when she said her feet were killing her
3141280 the answer is yes mary simply because you took such delight in discussing your plantar warts hay fever and fallen arches
3141281 the answer is no mary simply because you took such delight in discussing your plantar warts hayfever and fallen arches
3141282 she also designed the angel to make me feel guilty
3141283 ever seen an angel with an attitude that was her idea too
3141284 press the button on the back of the angel to hear her list of ailments
3141285 a tombstone and an angel with an attitude why me
3141286 bless her heart this has to be the happiest day of her life
3141287 so this is what it took to make her happy
3141288 she did make a lot of close friends in the medical community
3141289 never is not the operative word here she was hit by a car
3141290 mary im sorry i dared you to go a whole day without taking your meds
3141291 she was run over by a truck shortly after ordering the stone
3141292 she was certainly persistent she carried that thought to her grave
3141293 you should have known better than to hire a gargoyle sculptor to make a tombstone angel
3141294 mary was sick as she said now we believe her because shes dead
3141295 antes de comenzar esta columna ten a como gran virtud la constancia
3141296 you know we have that in the u s all the time
3141297 apparently its a rarity here so i dont feel any less safe here than i do in new york city
3141298 i guess hearing that news doesnt make me feel that good
3141299 its very difficult for a lot of people to get visas
3141300 its difficult for a lot of people to get access to the beautiful olympic center if you dont have tickets you just want to visit the olympic park that has the downside of spoiling some of the beauty of the olympics for some people
3141301 i think theyre scared so theyre trying to use all the resources theyve got to make people safe
3141302 so we said we go dressed in orange so they know we are not americans
3141303 these are similar to kiosks consumers are already familiar with
3141304 consumers are already comfortable with buying cosmetics and other items like this from vending machines
3141305 customers can expect the same type of price on items that theyd find in our retail stores
3141306 she love s anything japanese like going down to sawtelle and looking at all the japanese y stuff
3141307 that song is about a specific guy that i used to date and specific issues that he had the song is about my ex wearing guyliner and taking emo pictures of himself in the bathroom mirror the listeners have to read the context of the song and decide for themselves
3141308 it looks like a tanning bed you go lay down and it helps with your speech and your focusing and all that so it helps my brain its really exciting
3141309 we are six weeks into the process now and weve seen great improvements with memory her cognitive skills her ability to ambulate her joints have loosened up drastically so ive been very pleased with it
3141310 most of these have to do with neurological problems brain injuries stroke cerebral palsy potentially for autism
3141311 we cant promise that this will be of miraculous benefit but theres enough evidence out there to show this is at least worth trying
3141312 uralkali sells potash to makers of mixed fertilizers or directly to farmers the potash industrys response to the announcement was extreme there is a great deal of concern in the sector and uralkalis announcement also slammed potash related share prices in europe as well as shares in the sector on wall street
3141313 uralkali is a monopoly in russia and is subject to regulation the russian government is protecting russian consumers uralkali produces about 5 3 million tons of potash a year 10 to 15 of which is sold in russia
3141314 uralkalis announcement is an internal russian issue and it doesnt make sense for it to affect the rest of the world
3141315 the price of potash will stabilize at about 1 000 per ton in my opinion though i dont expect them to pass that level
3141316 those are the prices in present contracts and even in europe where prices are traditionally lower contracts are closing at that level

3141338 son you have to not worry about finding cows you just keep walking and eventually they will be found remember we do not need the cows they need us to give birth to champion stock
3141339 papa papa lets run down there and screw one of them cows
3141340 no son we are not going to run down there and screw one of them we are going to walk down there and screw them all
3141341 there is a man and a woman who find each other it seems that nothing bad could ever happen between these two until that fateful day he does the unthinkable one thing that no woman could ever forgive many of the movies vary on what this unthinkable thing is she finds out and he proceeds to prove his love by sending dozens of roses calling hundreds of times and spending thousands of dollars he will do whatever it takes oh and dont forget the if you love her him then go get her which usually leads to some far fetched chase that would land anyone in the real world in a jail
3141342 through the progression of song writing we became more philosophical

3141352 viele anbieter versuchen die kunden zu langen vertragslaufzeiten zu berreden ich wage zu bezweifeln dass alle kunden damit gl cklich sind man sollte sich auf jeden fall vor der unterschrift informieren ob der anbieter lange oder kurze vertragslaufzeiten hat
3141353 kunden sind nicht mehr gewillt sich langfristig an einen anbieter zu binden sie wollen von g nstigen preisen profitieren und flexibel sein
3141354 das ist f r uns nat rlich mit dem anspruch verbunden unsere alice produkte sowie zusatzoptionen auch weiterhin konsequent entsprechend der bed rfnisse unserer kunden und den entwicklungen des marktes zu optimieren

3141359 weve made up some terms to help describe our sound
3141360 troy calls it freight train music i call it deth jamn correct spelling
3141361 at the root of it all its just four guys walking a razors edge between the sublime and the utterly ludicrous we usually spill over into the utterly ludicrous
3141362 we dont expect to be perfect our imperfections help make us what we are and i think that kind of approach separates us from bands who tend to take things too seriously
3141363 we enjoy what we do and that really shows when were performing
3141364 we get on stage and have a good time and the crowd picks up on that energy which creates a great vibe we can play a dive bar a blues bar a folk festival a punk show hell we could even play a country bar
3141365 the only problem i have encountered with our category is that most people think were a hardcore band because of our name once they hear us or come see us they realize that we are nothing like that
3141366 usually involves a bottle of wild turkey a blow torch cotton candy and a giant octopus
3141367 i usually sail the high seas drinking jack daniels on a pirate ship that i constructed out of empty beer cans keg shells and palm fronds oh and there is a tiki bar on the pirate ship that i built out of coconuts and tortoise shells
3141368 i graduated from usf and i work for the department of envi ronmental protection in my off band time i work in water quality i collect water samples and conduct biological assessments on streams and lakes i also love to go mountain biking canoeing and hiking anything outdoors
3141369 i wrote the bios and its all true every last diabolical word of it

3141373 seguimos sin tratar los temas pendientes y todo est igual o peor que el 10 de marzo pasado porque los precios internacionales caen y los costos para producir suben enormemente
3141374 se termin la sensaci n de aire fresco que dej la votaci n del senado adem s rodaron cabezas pero no llegaron cambios en la pol tica
3141375 los signos son malos y la gente est muy nerviosa todo est siendo discutido en asambleas del interior del pa s
3141376 estamos haciendo asambleas casi todas las noches y esto se est viendo en todo el pa s
3141377 volvimos al 10 de marzo con las retenciones pero a valores de producci n m s bajos y con costos m s altos
3141378 nunca se implement un plan de esa envergadura de bacheo y veredas a lo largo y lo ancho de toda la ciudad
3141379 primero quer amos parar las causas y el estudio nos dio que el 95 lo produc an las empresas de servicios porque el cierre de los baches se hace de forma precaria apenas se hace el cierre a los pocos meses tenemos un bache nuevo en la ciudad
3141380 durante los primeros meses del a o se taparon m s de 15 000 baches y estimamos para fin de a o taparemos un total de 35 000 en julio los baches no superaban los 10 000 estimamos a fin de a o llegar a menos de 5000 baches
3141381 c mo camina la gente y c mo viaja la gente en la ciudad en ese esfuerzo estamos hemos hecho bastante pero creemos que es importante dar cuenta de lo que hacemos con el dinero de la gente
3141382 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3141383 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3141384 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3141385 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3141386 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3141387 it costs so much to be u full human being that there are very few who have the enlightenment or the courage to pay the price one has to abandon altogether the search for security and reach out to the risk of living with both arms
3141388 most people tend to overcompensate people who are riddled with doubts tend to be dogmatists who are never wrong superiority complex
3141389 to tell you my thoughts is to locate myself in a category
3141390 it could have been better if i am a child forever
3141391 haha he always tells me like that in response to my cliche quetions like
3141392 the other way is to say so much that they cant possibly sort it all out and figure out anything about you
3141393 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3141394 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3141395 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3141396 while this was a very difficult decision we feel it was the right thing to do for the future of midway
3141397 we view every game as an investment that must meet certain standards for quality scheduling and profitability midway remains committed to producing the highest quality entertainment as evidenced by our strong holiday line up which includes tna impact blitz the league ii and mortal kombat vs dc universe starring a team of mk characters and some of the most recognizable dc comics personalities such as batman the joker and superman

3141401 stopping russia the us and its allies must unite against moscows war on georgia
3141402 this is a grave challenge to the united states and europe
3141403 the united states and its nato allies must together impose a price on russia
3141404 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3141405 greater financial discipline at individual institutions must be reinforced by a renewed commitment to collective discipline in the spirit of elevated financial statesmanship to put aside specific interests in the name of the common interest

3141408 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy

3141410 specialized health care needs of women veterans including victims of sexual assault
3141411 these are all things that are either going on already or need more oomph to get them going in washington
3141412 there is merit to helping some veterans who live in extremely rural areas to get care
3141413 but we want to make sure its not the start of a process that will raise medical prices because the va will have to pay that non va doctors fees which will not be the same as the bill if the government provided the care
3141414 this isnt a beauty contest its more like a show in a nightclub

3141472 the allocation is based on the needs of the students
3141473 school nurse ratios and coverage differ widely from district to district
3141474 i see a lot of schools doing without there are rural schools with no nurse period not even one in the district nonlicensed people are making medical decisions about medications and diabetic care
3141475 nurses can make children optimally ready to learn and make sure kids understand proper hygiene something as simple as hand washing will reduce the number of absences
3141476 school nurses salaries are about 23 less than those of hospital nurses
3141477 typically you start all over at the bottom of the pay scale because the school is not willing to give nurses credit for nursing experience like they give teachers for teaching experience
3141478 the first thing we did was get the dehumidifier in so that we would have a dry basement and it would be inviting to come down here

3141495 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
3141496 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
3141497 what she will treasure the most is the fact that she was his wife for 30 years and not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly

3141503 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3141504 do you remember what happens to the melody when we sing in a round
3141505 worldwide market for total cell phones is somewhere around 1 billion and our objective of getting 1 of it would yield 10 million units

3141513 il governo smetta di giocare ai soldatini e risponda della grave situazione economica in cui versa il paese
3141514 la verit che il paese da marciapiede i segni del disagio li offre e in abbondanza da tempo ma la politica li toglie dai titoli di testa sviando lattenzione con le immagini del presidente spazzino linutile gioco dei soldatini nelle citt i finti problemi di sicurezza la lotta al fannullone

3141521 ceasefire agreement is signed by two sides when they meet
3141522 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3141523 it seems that this will not change anything but will move us away from resolving the situation
3141524 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3141525 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3141526 its quite possible that they will use this was support for their case but one cant determine that because a species is under less threat from extinction that its automatically okay to start hunting them
3141527 as oil fell to a 14 week low below us114 per barrel
3141528 our businesses again delivered strong growth in a challenging economic environment our consistent operating performance reflects the actions we have taken to transform air products into a higher growth and less cyclical company under any economic scenario
3141529 we also announced two major orders in tonnage gases completed the sale of our remaining polymer emulsions assets and are moving forward with the decision to sell our us healthcare business
3141530 we expect to continue to benefit from our very strong new business signings and the geographic diversity of our markets and portfolio of businesses we are not however relying on growth and pricing alone we will continue to focus relentlessly on driving productivity and reducing costs
3141531 our us healthcare employees have worked very hard to execute our plan to increase volumes and reduce costs unfortunately despite progress in a number of areas the us business is still not meeting expectations
3141532 at this time we believe the decision to sell this business is in the best interest of our shareholders this in no way affects our healthcare operations outside of the us which continue to perform well and remain a core component of our strategy moving forward
3141533 id ask you to stay and have a drink but im afraid you might accept

3141544 artists feed each other not just through critique which we do but when you paint with someone you get ideas you are inspired by each others work it is enriching

3141548 yes a billion it is quite a hard number to wrap your head around but i am still young and very determined to get it done i figure that i have at least thirty years to plant a billion trees it will be my life
3141549 the earth is going through a warming trend which usually natural but we humans have accelerated the rate of the warming by producing massive amounts of carbon dioxide emissions we have depended upon fossil fuels for our energy for hundreds of years and will for many more
3141550 the goal is to plant enough trees to pull the excess carbon dioxide out of the air and lock it back up in the earth for another few hundred thousand years that is what trees do
3141551 for every one ton of mass in a tree about one and a half tons of carbon dioxide are removed from the air of that one and a half tons of carbon dioxide about one ton is turned into oxygen and the other half ton is locked up in the tree and the earth as solid organic carbon
3141552 it can be done it will take time and i know that it is going to be a slow start i dont intend on doing it on my own though that would break my back and my checkbook really quick i started a website where people can donate money to the cause volunteers and i will then plant the trees in addition to http www greenifynow org i also have a myspace page where i have found over three hundred people in a week that are willing to help
3141553 i cannot personally plant a billion trees but i will be responsible for getting it done
3141554 an ancient israelite sect called the essenes dressed in white as do some kabbalists
3141555 we started this company in response to the needs of a local literacy program we use the artwork of not necessarily well known artists that may do incredible work but may not have the resources to market themselves the village concept is it takes a village or community to raise a child but you have to take that to the next level and help inspire that child even employ that child when you can
3141556 my business partner and i saw the hustle and sales made by some of the teens and were very impressed
3141557 we know teens want to show they can handle themselves and yet they still need the security and guidance of home we require parent or guardians permission for them to come on board and we are selective part of what we will ask is for them to tell us their sales plan for the puzzles in a way we are offering the teens a mini business course from which they can make a profit if they apply themselves

3141572 please say a prayer for the families of those who lost loved ones on that fateful day
3141573 just as there is no national weather map we are working hard to educate consumers that each market and neighborhood varies in such critical indicators as appreciation inventory and time on market
3141574 to me this is one of the greatest times to buy a home in my 33 years in the business in most markets inventory is up giving buyers choices combined with interest rates being at near historic low levels and home prices leveling off after the 1995 2005 bull run this should help buyers get off the fence i am concerned that many including first time home buyers might miss out on this opportunity because they are reading national headlines and not gaining a local perspective this is especially important for the military families stationed at fort stewart so many are overseas protecting our country and only getting national reports about the housing market when they return they are pre conditioned to not explore the long term benefits of home ownership which include appreciation that has run 6 2 percent annually according to the national association of realtors over the last 25 years we also have an obligation in our industry to educate buyers and sellers that they move for lifestyle reasons and to view their home as a home not a winning lottery ticket
3141575 having jim come to hinesville speaks volumes to the success our company has had and our value to the coldwell banker organization
3141576 it is ironic that he spoke so much about local conditions being important because we spend so much time educating consumers and the fort stewart troops each and every day about the hinesville market
3141577 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
3141578 we today come to fort mccoy to seek an end to the war in and occupation of iraq by the united states
3141579 the strain upon service men and women and their families continues unabated with repeat deployments to iraq

3141586 we felt fortunate to have had so much support during the hardest time in our lives we understand that not every child and family has the resources and support we received during such an emotionally and financially draining time
3141587 in 2007 we organized a golf tournament in which 100 of the proceeds will be used to support the families of children needing surgery for congenital heart defects this includes assisting with meals and lodging for families while their children are hospitalized as well as providing money to support the pioneering research of dr galantowicz and the department of pediatric cardiac surgery at nationwide childrens hospital last year the event raised 8 000 for the heart center and this years goal is 10 000
3141588 tafaya has been a terrific asset to dcps this summer as an integral member of the school opening and transition team she worked with school communities to develop stronger cultures to ensure that schools are ready to teach and children are ready to learn most impressively she ran a district wide field assessment of all our schools readiness for the start of school this latter activity required persistence strong analytics deep organizational skills public speaking and facilitating and tremendous hard work the result was a high quality assessment of our schools to guide our efforts for the month before school starts absolutely invaluable and she did it all with grace and a great sense of humor

3141591 an off duty gainesville police officer that was en route going home spotted and confronted the suspect which the suspect pointed the gun at the officer
3141592 our hall county s w a t team attempted negotiations with the perpetrator during it we had one officer injured
3141593 anytime we have someone barricaded with a firearm not only do was have to worry about the officers we need to worry about the general public also
3141594 we dont have any information to believe the perpetrator was going to that school just as a safety precaution we worked with the school board to shut down the school to make sure everyone was safe
3141595 this is really just an offshoot of a project that is really aimed at trying to develop a methodology ultimately to be used in surgery

3141598 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3141599 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3141600 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3141601 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3141602 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3141603 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3141604 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3141605 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision

3141622 its only a hate crime when the victim is intentionally selected specifically because of their ethnic religious or sexual identity
3141623 hate crimes are message crimes they are intended to harm not just the immediate victim but all people of that same class within the community

3141765 to be honest the real reason why i dont think ill go to his party is that i just dont think i have the energy
3141766 i mean petanque then dinner then drinks thats asking a lot
3141767 what ever happened to just having people over to your apartment for a couple beers
3141768 generation y or millenials are an incredibly self absorbed population
3141769 in my research i have found that most young people expect their friends to spend an average of 47 and five hours on them for each milestone occasion birthday going away party et cetera perhaps surprisingly most of their friends comply perhaps because they expect reciprocity when their turn comes along

3141794 the courts order is an illegal prior restraint on legitimate academic research in violation of the first amendment
3141795 the court has adopted an interpretation of the statute that is blatantly unconstitutional equating discussion in a public forum with computer intrusion
3141796 it will just stop the public from knowing that these systems are vulnerable and from pressuring the companies that develop and implement them to fix security holes

3141798 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
3141799 this is a planning took where all things are going
3141800 the surgery was very successful in lining up the fractures and repairing the nail bed
3141801 not to use too much of a pun but i think we probably hit a home run putting it back together considering what the doctors said in cincinnati
3141802 im so happy and calm now in your heart you feel its all going to be fine but until they tell you its over youre not calm
3141803 he didnt seem scared or apprehensive of course hes a little drowsy but he seems just fine we were real happy
3141804 this was the first option the best option for him
3141805 we were able to use the first option being able to line up the fracture without having to do too many incisions he has two incisions but theyre very small
3141806 i think this is going to successfully treat the problem so that will be good the best case scenario if we had a little more time in the season we would probably try to push things
3141807 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
3141808 all three replied in more or less unison agreeing profusely wrapping their arms round each other and laughing helplessly
3141809 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
3141810 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
3141811 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
3141812 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
3141813 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
3141814 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others

3141826 we are fulfilling our agreement with the georgian government that in an emergency we would assist them in redeploying their troops
3141827 we are honoring that commitment and we are following through with that
3141828 commanders on the ground are making necessary adjustments to mitigate any of the impact of the loss of georgian forces
3141829 quite frankly these were good soldiers but weve been able to adapt at the battle space to account for their loss
3141830 i not only said it to russian prime minister vladimir putin ive said it to the president of the country dmitriy medvedev
3141831 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3141832 there needs to be an international mediation there for the south ossetia issue
3141833 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3141834 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3141835 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3141836 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3141837 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3141838 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3141839 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3141840 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3141841 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3141842 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

3141858 people who would kill their sisters or daughters for bringing shame on the family would do anything to avoid being labeled a debtor
3141859 get to tell city council what they think the priorities should be
3141860 the demand for green collar jobs is really exploding especially as the cost of energy continues to climb
3141861 students need to start thinking about developing skills that will give them an edge for these types of careers that did not even exist until recently
3141862 in the next 10 years we will put a man on the moon
3141863 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3141864 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3141865 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3141866 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3141867 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3141868 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3141869 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3141870 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3141871 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3141872 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3141873 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3141874 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3141875 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3141876 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3141877 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3141878 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3141879 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

3141886 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3141887 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3141888 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3141889 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3141890 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3141891 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3141892 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3141893 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3141894 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3141895 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3141896 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3141897 who are open to doing something on the production side
3141898 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3141899 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3141900 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3141901 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3141902 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3141903 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3141904 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3141905 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3141906 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3141907 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3141908 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3141909 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3141910 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

3141933 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3141934 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3141935 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3141936 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3141937 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3141938 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

3141941 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3141942 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3141943 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3141944 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3141945 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3141946 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3141947 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3141948 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3141949 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3141950 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3141951 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3141952 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3141953 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3141954 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3141955 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3141956 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3141957 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3141958 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3141959 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3141960 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3141961 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3141962 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3141963 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3141964 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3141965 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

3142007 claude has made a strong contribution to the airline as head of air canada cargo and i am very pleased that he has accepted the challenge of leading the global sales team at air canada
3142008 his proven leadership skills coupled with his commitment to customer relationship management makes him the right candidate for this key position as the airline continues to innovate the way it sells and distributes its product
3142009 that air canada is recognized as the industry leader in sales and the use of new technologies is a tribute to marc rosenberg
3142010 marc has held more than a dozen increasingly responsible positions with air canada following his first summer job with the airline in 1967 and then joining the company in 1972 since becoming vice president sales and product distribution in 1996 marc has driven an overhaul of our sales and distribution systems modernizing them to make them more efficient and effective while building our relationship with the travel agent community which voted air canada its favorite airline in the influential 2007 agents choice award for canadian travel agents we will miss marcs dynamic leadership but he leaves behind a tremendous legacy for the company to build upon

3142193 beyond his special human qualities his great sensitivity to the numerous cultures that express themselves in the great pacific area and within the forum his proven skills we would like to remember above all else his commitment to the advancement of the french pacific communities integration within this organization
3142194 even before taking on his role as forum secretary general greg enjoyed a distinguished career focused on service to the pacific it was fitting that greg should end his career as head of the forum secretariat the south pacific was where greg made his home his enthusiasm and love of our region was very evident in the way he went about his work
3142195 gregs appointment in 2003 coincided with the launch of work on the pacific plan an effort strongly supported by to develop closer co operation the development of regional solutions to pressing issues
3142196 greg was a strong advocate for the pacific and his passing is a great loss his significant service to the pacific islands forum region will be remembered by all who had the privilege of working with him
3142197 i would be completely in error not to say that my time in as secretary general has been a period of enormous satisfaction overall one for which i can only express my thanks to all of those who made it possible
3142198 critical in my absolute view to the business of showing all of our regional organizations to work most effectively and concertedly with each other rather than continue to be prone to pull against one another something which despite a good deal of effort on our own part we remain something of a captive to
3142199 it has also included in a very integral way the complex far reaching work we have been doing in the area of trade relations of fisheries as regards the eu but also as regards picta and further down the track the whole issue of pacer the pacer picta issues important in themselves will again have it seems to me a direct reinforcing effort on the whole effort we are making to strengthen our regional integration
3142200 let me conclude by thanking you the foc members and the forum secretariat for all youve done in the service of our wonderful region it has been an honour and a privilege to work with you all let us take this work forward together

3142205 i want a job that has benefits and better pay
3142206 oftentimes if a prison is located in a place where there arent a lot of jobs but there are a lot of women that are single and in many cases raising children on their own they dont have a lot of other opportunities
3142207 it was a job with job security thats why i took it
3142208 they see the women as easy prey they will flatter you theyll listen to everything you say and use it against you
3142209 but if you stay with it long enough and you are bright enough you learn to use words a lot and that can get you out of a lot of stuff
3142210 people have found over the years that women in a male prison have profoundly had a calming effect
3142211 men act differently when women are around its just a fact of life
3142212 early on i learned a lot of the guys although they were here for whatever the crime they still had respect for women they are not as ready to go physically at a woman as a man
3142213 nothing to do but watch you and if they know they can play you they will i constantly say take your hands out of your pants pull your pants up pull your shirt up but the more straightforward and professional you are the less problems you tend to have
3142214 my experience is they do the same job as the men and i dont see a disadvantage
3142215 but im tired of struggling so much you can make so much money here

3142219 and its a case where we could have acted and bought land five or 10 years ago and it would have never happened
3142220 when they drew the lines to create yellowstone it was a group of men sitting in an office in washington d c with a map and a ruler
3142221 when people visit the big parks they dont get the fact that the federal government doesnt own all the land

3142229 then its a race to figure out the game the players change but mostly its what ea does with the game the new features

3142231 randy moss has a big advantage over any defensive back
3142232 just throw the ball up and hell go get it
3142233 im very competitive and i like to match wits with other opponents
3142234 i love to talk trash thats the best part of the game for me
3142235 if youre playing a good defensive back like antonio cromartie why would the ball go through his hands and hit him in the face
3142236 ea does it because they dont want the backs to have outrageous interception stats but its really annoying
3142237 it should balance out between someone with twitch skills and someone who knows football strategy

3142244 made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
3142245 to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
3142246 there are already russian aircraft over georgia so the chances of direct engagement between russian and nato aircraft is very high
3142247 if you are in moscow and you are looking at the tools that the u s nato and the eu have what are they
3142248 nobody is going to send troops so you are going to get away with it
3142249 get off the phone and onto a plane and make it completely clear to moscow that our relationship depends on what they do from here on out

3142253 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
3142254 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
3142255 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
3142256 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
3142257 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
3142258 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
3142259 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
3142260 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

3142273 my own people used to say to me you speak like a white woman
3142274 what does that even mean anyway everyone has their way of speaking and living their life no one should be judging and assuming that because im black i have to speak in that hip hop way thats something i prefer not to do

3142280 behind the rhetoric of corporate responsibility very little has changed
3142281 i am exhausted to death now none of us have time to go to toilet or drink water we are working without rest and are always afraid of not working fast enough to supply soles to the next production line campaign statement
3142282 people have always been fascinated by how some trees such as douglas fir or redwoods can grow so tall
3142283 this is not an easy thing to do think about trying to drink water through a narrow 350 foot long straw it takes a lot of suction
3142284 higher and higher in the tree the valves are able to withstand more pulling force from the long heavy column of water before air bubbles can be sucked through
3142285 but the problem is that the valves become less efficient at letting water pass the height at which no water would pass at all according to our models coincides the tallest records for douglas fir about 350 to 400 feet
3142286 as you go higher and higher in a douglas fir tree its almost like experiencing a drought
3142287 and thats what we see at the tops of very tall trees the foliage is struggling to get enough water and seems to be under drought stress its not unusual to see periodic die back at the tops of very tall douglas fir trees that are near their height limits
3142288 weve learned that the nf1 gene affects stature through a different pathway than the one weve previously focused on to understand cancers in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1
3142289 given that this second pathway has been linked to cancer in other contexts we may need to consider the possibility that it is contributing to these tumors and alter our treatment goals accordingly
3142290 we wanted to know if we could blame this on ras protein activity so we generated new mice with normal levels of neurofibromin expression but increased levels of ras activation in brain stem cells
3142291 what weve learned also may help us gain insight into other disease processes
3142292 there are a number of other rare genetic abnormalities that cause short stature and this same pathway may be involved
3142293 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3142294 both the fungus and the birds eat chilies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
3142295 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3142296 having such a specific defense one that doesnt harm reproduction or dispersal is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant and i think it is a great example of the power of natural selection
3142297 by contrast peppers increase their chemical defense levels or their heat as they ripen this is a very different model and peppers can get away with it because birds dont sense pain when they eat capsaicin
3142298 i think a lot of plants would love to come up with this way of stopping fungal growth without inhibiting dispersers its just very hard to do
3142299 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3142300 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3142301 in the north any adaptive benefit to using eating chilies would be much smaller than at the equator because microbial infection of food is less common and its easier to keep food cold maybe thats why food in the north can be so boring
3142302 along the equator without access to refrigeration you could be dead pretty quickly unless you can find a way to protect yourself against the microbes you ingest every day
3142303 we hear from some users who really appreciate the benefits of relevant advertising and some who prefer not to receive this type of marketing so we decided to offer transparency and choice about the options that are available to all users
3142304 greatest asset so we strive to create the most trusted compelling experience online
3142305 we moved up the announcement date in order to let congress know about the options available to consumers
3142306 confident that consumers are responding to the customization of online content and they would prefer relevant advertising that saves them time and money
3142307 we believe that consumers are seeking online networks that offer that customization within a relationship of trust in that sense we believe that we create more business value by offering transparency and choice in our
3142308 this is a small fraction of a percent of our total user base
3142309 our survey illustrates that u s online consumers want choice and control when it comes to personal information that is collected about them by giving users the option to choose idc believes the site will build greater trust with users and that the majority will not opt out of these services if they trust the site
3142310 yahoo is taking the high road here to build trust realizing that so far most of its users have not actually gone through the steps of opting out of targeted

3142313 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change

3142319 in light of recent developments in caucasus the immigration absorption ministry will devise an aliyah plan for each immigrant from georgia and will offer increased funding for housing language education and employment

3142325 while claiming to be protecting the world from proliferation threats in iraq libya iran and north korea american leaders have not only abandoned existing treaty restrictions but also assert plans to test and develop new weapons including antiballistic missiles the earth penetrating bunker buster and perhaps some secret new small bombs they have also reversed another long standing policy by threatening first use of nuclear weapons against non nuclear states

3142328 one of our bedrock privacy principles is transparency by which we mean that we are upfront with our users about what information we collect and how we use it so that they can make informed choices about their personal information
3142329 ensuring that we earn and keep our users trust is an essential constant for building the best possible products
3142330 with every google product we work hard to earn and keep that trust with a long standing commitment to protect the privacy of our users personal information
3142331 both last octet of the ip address and the full unique cookie id
3142332 used in association with other information to identify an individual
3142333 we also believe that a strong and easy to find mechanism to permit consumers to opt out of this type of data collection is a goal that all companies should aspire to achieve
3142334 opt out mechanisms for online advertising are often buried in fine print difficult to understand hard to execute and technically inadequate
3142335 moreover in most cases opt out mechanisms offered for behavioral advertising only opt a user out of receiving targeted ads but do not opt the user out of data collection about his or her internet usage
3142336 individual web sites and search engines and their affiliates that monitor users also owe consumers constructive notice of such activities and the right to limit or thwart any personal data collection
3142337 these are similar to kiosks consumers are already familiar with
3142338 consumers are already comfortable with buying cosmetics and other items like this from vending machines
3142339 customers can expect the same type of price on items that theyd find in our retail stores

3142345 americans wishing to spend august vacationing with their families or watching the olympics may wonder why their newspapers and television screens are filled with images of war in the small country of georgia
3142346 georgia is an ancient country at the crossroads of eastern europe and central asia and one of the worlds first nations to adopt christianity as an official religion
3142347 following fraudulent parliamentary elections in 2003 a peaceful democratic revolution took place led by the u
3142348 what the people of georgia have accomplished in terms of democratic governance a western orientation and domestic reform is nothing short of remarkable
3142349 in recent days moscow has sent its tanks and troops across the internationally recognized border into the georgian region of south ossetia
3142350 the implications of russian actions go beyond their threat to the territorial integrity and independence of a democratic georgia
3142351 yesterday georgia withdrew its troops from south ossetia and offered a ceasefire
3142352 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe it is time we moved forward with a number of steps
3142353 the united states and our allies should continue efforts to bring a resolution before the un security council condemning russian aggression noting the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of russian troops from georgian territory
3142354 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia a partnership for peace nation
3142355 the secretary of state should begin high level diplomacy including visiting europe to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3142356 the u s should work with azerbaijan and turkey and other interested friends to develop plans to strengthen the security of the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline
3142357 the u s should send immediate economic and humanitarian assistance to help mitigate the impact the invasion has had on the people of georgia
3142358 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attacks withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia
3142359 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3142360 the kill switch is a very controlling gesture i am not sure why apple didnt disclose it up front as simply a security measure
3142361 consumers will accept an awful lot if you let them know what they are accepting
3142362 forcing us to download and reinstall the entire program for every little update and bundling quicktime too whether its new or not
3142363 so why does the itunes store still employ digital rights management drm for the majority of songs in its library blaming the record labels no longer holds water amazonmp3 and rhapsody are among a growing number of services selling drm free mp3s from all the major labels not just emi
3142364 apple seems unwilling to acknowledge that people get music from sources other than itunes how else to explain the softwares inability to monitor folders and automatically add new music to the library
3142365 earlier this year apple hopped aboard the crapware train by adding its new for windows safari browser to its software update tool which tends to appear whenever theres a new version of itunes
3142366 if youre going to keep clinging to drm apple how about giving us a music subscription service to go with it you know the kind offered by napster rhapsody and zune marketplace
3142367 itunes is like a strict schoolmarm if you dont listen to your subscribed podcasts on a frequent and regular basis the program stops downloading new episodes
3142368 next to every single item in your library songs tv shows podcasts and so a little check box its been there as long as we can remember but if the itunes help function explains its purpose that entry is really hard to find
3142369 actually its pretty simple unchecked items dont get played when youre listening to your library or a playlist likewise unchecked items dont get synced to your ipod if you enable the sync only checked songs and videos option in the devices summary menu
3142370 come on apple make nice with nbc already swallow your pride and get nbc back on board in time for september
3142371 here we are seven versions into itunes and the player still doesnt have decent dockable controls
3142372 dockable itunes toolbar with volume seek play pause and other controls and an optional song info ticker

3142374 admittedly smallish ipod screens dont lend themselves well to reading on the go but the iphone and ipod touch are perfect for the job
3142375 the fec had sent two letters to the obama campaign seeking additional information regarding contributions it received that appeared to exceed the 2300 legal limit among those questionable contributions were donations from monir and hosam edwan the obama campaign responded to the first letter in may 2008 but apparently the fec was not satisfied with its response and sent out a second letter to the obama campaign on july 30 2008 requesting additional information for sixteen pages of questionable contributions including several of monir edwans contributions so apparently the obama campaign failed to tell the fec about the refunded money both in its original fec report and in its response to the fecs letter in may of 2008 5 months after they allegedly returned the money otherwise the fec would have had no reason to further question them about these donations in its follow up letter in july which makes the obama campaigns claim that it returned their donations in december all the more difficult to swallow

3142464 i felt much more attracted to women and just felt like a man but i knew i was not lesbian
3142465 if todays athletes say they want to take the risk they really dont know what risk they are taking
3142466 the ioc means business in stamping out those who are not playing by the rules
3142467 we are going to hunt down the shameless people who are causing harm to the health of our athletes
3142468 we will look to apply the maximum law to totally clamp down on drug taking in sport we will go to the courts because we want to jail all the cheats

3142470 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050
3142471 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3142472 couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution
3142473 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from specific decisions she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
3142474 her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
3142475 clintons top advisers never agreed on the answer over the course of the campaign they split into competing factions that drifted in and out of clintons favor but always seemed to work at cross purposes and clinton herself could never quite decide who was right
3142476 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
3142477 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
3142478 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
3142479 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
3142480 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
3142481 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
3142482 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
3142483 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the chinese people at all
3142484 my attitude is if youve got relations with sudanese president omar hassan al bashir think about helping to solve the humanitarian crisis in darfur
3142485 joey cheek has just got to know that i took the sudanese message for him to the chinese government
3142486 it gave me a chance to say to the chinese people religion wont hurt you
3142487 and it gave me a chance to say to the government why dont you register the underground churches and give them a chance to flourish
3142488 young men with unlimited capital looking for interesting legitimate investment opportunities and business propositions
3142489 it could have either sold millions or if there were riots be one of the best documentaries ever made

3142496 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3142497 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3142498 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3142499 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3142500 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3142501 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3142502 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3142503 in terms of the conservative constituency of the republican party sen
3142504 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3142523 we struggled pretty bad in qualifying but they never got down and then gave me a great car in the first round but we just didnt have quite enough were disappointed of course but the way our team battled back is a testament to the great group of people we have working on our car
3142524 it sure was a great feeling going some rounds in sonoma
3142525 our race car is great and our team is awesome we just got some bad breaks before sonoma

3142527 we had a car that we could use in top alcohol and bucky austin a racer and family friend said he would build our motors
3142528 after a few divisional races in 2004 we won our first national event in las vegas in 2005 in 2006 i finally decided that i wanted to go all or nothing and make racing my career i took a big risk and left my job to try to devote 100 of my time to turning my hobby into my career then i got the phone call from jim o jim oberhofer it was completely unexpected prior to the phone call i had heard about ken black racing and kalitta motorsports teaming up to go top fuel racing but i never ever considered myself for the driving position i didnt even consider applying for it
3142529 there is a big difference between top alcohol dragster and top fuel
3142530 top alcohol is the best prep for top fuel because it helped me get used to the speed acceleration and how quickly everything happens

3142561 i preferred not having the status quo and i think it is a national security issue
3142562 in this incident the positive and proactive initiative of the atc controller who on realising that mobile audio communication from the pilot was intermittent quickly switched to texting his instructions instead

3142579 just because the air bag does not inflate does not mean air is not flowing through the system but we are looking into that
3142580 in a tight space like that the odor is going to be very strong
3142581 we follow all airworthiness directives and if this one applies to our fleet well have it completed by the time the faa directs us to do so
3142582 both parties have agreed on mutually agreeable terms to part company
3142583 it is an amicable arrangement and we appreciate and respect the issues that ruud has highlighted with the club and are very grateful for all the hard work he has contributed while with the organization hopefully he has laid the foundations for future success for the los angeles galaxy
3142584 in truth it has proved a lot more difficult than i anticipated for my family to settle in the area and the club has been very supportive and understanding of my decision
3142585 i would like to thank the players and the fans for their fantastic support and i wish the l a galaxy much success in the future i would now like to spend some time with my family before considering any other position in football
3142586 with ruud moving on we believe that this is the right time to make more sweeping changes throughout the organization

3142601 so to lay a whole new level of change and even more uncertainty for the business i think would be a real challenge for telecom and could in fact increase costs with perhaps some rather uncertain benefits
3142602 that cant intrinsically be good value for long term holders of a telecommunications stock
3142603 there is not a wider concerted offer behind what we have put together today so far

3142643 they can be surprisingly expensive for the quality so i suppose the image of the cheap backpackers hostel is rapidly disappearing
3142644 they talk about the price but it doesnt prevent them from coming here and traveling
3142645 we chose hostels because i think we wanted a more authentic backpacking experience

3142653 perfect 10 has provided numerous iconic moments in the sports history mary lou rettons perfect 10 in 1984 at the los angeles games that memorable sticking of her full twisting tsukahara vault lore had it she had step in some soda on the way to the vault made her an instant star and clinched the gold for her

3142659 to tell you the truth i was concerned i would have a whole bunch of scars on my stomach and i didnt want that
3142660 we go through the vagina we go behind the uterus and that muscle doesnt sense pain the same way as the abdominal wall does
3142661 so its scar free hopefully we can improve the point of pain hopefully we can improve the point of recovery without putting patients at risk by making holes in their stomachs

3142666 i guess if youre going to finish second and they tell you that you qualify for the ryder cup i think that youll take it
3142667 i definitely feel like i played well enough to win but unfortunately it didnt happen so thats pretty much all i can ask myself to do
3142668 its not disappointing every time youre out there trying to win a major you know what can you do there can only be one winner im fine it was worse when i finished the open championship than this year
3142669 i feel like i played well enough to win probably more than two majors throughout my career unfortunately it hasnt happened that doesnt mean that im not in the right track so im looking forward to the challenges and i just am going to keep giving it my best and its just a matter of time
3142670 youre on such an adrenaline rush out there that you always try to take a deep breath and just try and enjoy the moment because you never know how many more opportunities youre going to get like this
3142671 obviously i know i can compete and hopefully this will carry over to next year and hopefully get a win by the end of this year

3142675 i was probably the only man happy to finish bogey bogey and think i had done well
3142676 even though i finished with three bogeys i played awesome for the first 15 holes at winged foot

3142678 ive been saying for three years now ive done my practice
3142679 i have spent ten years working all hours on my swing now i am here to play major championships
3142680 it has always been a part of my game the worse situation you put me in the better i get
3142681 i have always been good backed up against the wall
3142682 most guys who had won two in a row would be on cloud nine and would play great golf for the next six months
3142683 i will be fighting it the next time i play
3142684 if the government wants to go in that direction we are absolutely the right organisation to support the process for doing so
3142685 one of the things we think we could do really well would be to provide entirely independent objective information for individuals to make up their own mind we think we could do that very well and would be happy to do that
3142686 one of the big dangers of allowing people to top up their treatment is that consumers arent informed and they can be susceptible in a moment of crisis to pressure from pharmaceutical companies
3142687 these drugs can be very expensive and i would welcome the provision of a source of independent reliable advice
3142688 the fact that nice are preparing to offer advice shows that the realisation is finally filtering through that you cant with hold information on good drugs which are out there and what they can do even if the nhs cant afford it
3142689 but that has got to be balanced with some sort of mechanism to make sure that people can afford access to these treatments
3142690 any information which is available is obviously valuable but people would have less need to top up if nice did not reject cancer drugs available elsewhere
3142691 it seems that the government is intent on pre empting the outcome of its own consultation on top up payments and that it wants to assist people to buy their own drugs rather than have them provided on the nhs
3142692 but labour are still avoiding two key questions if patients buy top up drugs will that prejudice their access to nhs treatment secondly why is access to new cancer medicines worse in the uk than in the rest of europe and america

3142697 ceasefire agreement is signed by two sides when they meet
3142698 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3142699 it seems that this will not change anything but will move us away from resolving the situation
3142700 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3142701 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3142702 its quite possible that they will use this was support for their case but one cant determine that because a species is under less threat from extinction that its automatically okay to start hunting them

3142716 i didnt understand the dark knight i still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy
3142717 im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie
3142718 was written with just a hint of sarcasm and tone which hints at my being underwhelmed but the rest was genuinely positive

3142734 one of the biggest ones is the spending spree that the state went on she was in full support of that
3142735 a lot of people are very upset about the deficit and budget issues
3142736 but a lot of people are also concerned about the social issues especially dealing with parental rights and the repeal of the parental notification law
3142737 when this news first fluttered across the screen a few months back i thought those bastards

3142747 we were 40 hours into this and now the doctors are getting concerned about the water being broken and the possibility of infection
3142748 i wouldnt say shes alves suffering but shes having to dig deep shes tired shes exhausted shes in pain when the contractions come youve gotta push and in between them those 30 second intervals shes passing out and then coming back to and that went on for hours
3142749 and we had this problem upon contractions the babys pulse would sink it was getting down to 70 which means the umbilical cord is somewhere strapped across the oesophagus
3142750 the doctor called c section and as soon as they say c section 33 minutes later the babys out i was like 60 hours weve been in here and if wed have come in and just said lets just have it you could do it in three hours
3142751 it went down perfectly even though we went 60 hours to do what could have been done in a few hours it was a great journey for both of us

3142776 we are very pleased to report that airmedias financial results in the second quarter of 2008 were in line with our raised revenue guidance we are particularly excited about our roll out of digital frames to a total of sixteen airports which marked the successful source of revenue generation from this relatively new product line and underscored the increasing acceptance by advertisers of this innovative media format
3142777 we also complement airmedias organic business growth with our latest acquisitions which enabled us to expand into advertising business on gate bridges in airports making us well positioned to capture the growth opportunities in the air travel advertising sector in china while the olympic games currently taking place in beijing china may to certain extent limit our rapid growth in the short term since we are only allowed to sell advertisements to olympic sponsors in beijing capital international airport and qingdao liuting international airport from july 11 2008 to september 18 2008 the olympic games will further drive our growth in the long term as we have obtained several new clients who are olympic sponsors and we expect to continue to retain them after the olympic games we are expecting a strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2008 as we expect that non olympic sponsor clients will increase their advertising spending in the fourth quarter
3142778 we are very pleased with airmedias strong top line and bottom line financial results this quarter while we are experiencing gross margin pressure in the second quarter from the increased concession fees in connection with terminal 3 of beijing capital international airport and other newly signed concession rights contracts we believe these investments enable us to grow our revenues and maintain our leading position in the air travel advertising market in china we expect to improve on gross margin in the quarters after the olympic games

3142780 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3142781 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3142782 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3142783 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3142784 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3142785 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box

3142789 rio is the post card city for brazil and staging this event here will mean a lot
3142790 people from all over will now have time to plan their trip to the marvelous city to watch great tennis and get really close to the players that have made history in our sport this is an event that cant be missed

3142794 i dont think homosexuality has anything to do with this
3142795 the story of an occasional music journalist and full time techie who wakes up in the land of odd with a girlfriend
3142796 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3142797 hes from chicago and he showed he can make it if you push yourself
3142798 he was a good kid and he never did deny where he was raised up
3142799 he used to come back and give the kids coats for the winter he did a lot for the neighborhood
3142800 his show with the family was a positive showing that black people could have things and be successful in life
3142801 from time to time i would get a message from bernie saying nice move here or go get some more pitching it was a genuine love of the white sox and a love of chicago aside from being funny he was just a nice man i am just heartbroken
3142802 everyone who knew him was touched by him he was generous he had a very very very beautiful spirit he seemed very connected for that were all going to miss him even more than his comedy he was an individual there were many people who followed him who were inspired by him and borrowed his style and attitude he was a trailblazer and a leader and a sweetheart
3142803 he never forgot that he was a kid who grew up on chicagos south side because of his chicago roots we picked bernie mac to be the face of the state lottery his passion enthusiasm and humor helped make that one of our most successful and funniest campaigns
3142804 im at my wits end doctor its about my husband i truly need your help
3142805 well it started a while back hes lost all of his hair his head is totally bald there are large roundish swellings either side of his neck and his face has turned a strange purplish color hes too embarrassed to come out doctor oh please help him help him
3142806 my dear lady i suggest very strongly that you give this man the elbow what
3142807 the technology is really simple and the wells and the water and the earth will be there forever
3142808 its a huge resource but its a largely untapped resource
3142809 its like deciding between two cars one that costs 10 000 and one that costs 35 000
3142810 but the 35 000 car comes with a lifetime supply of gas now that energy prices are high people are beginning to think about what they pay for fuel
3142811 the relative story continues today with markets searching out the positive usd stories and focusing on falling commodity prices this is likely to add to recent weakness in both the nzd and aud throughout asian trading today
3142812 its such a peculiar thing happening so its probably the same person
3142813 it is time our politicians understood that caring for children is work and that caring for them without a partner and on a woefully inadequate benefit is very hard work indeed
3142814 the proposal to shift the abatement threshold to 100 is welcome but doesnt go far enough
3142815 if you are expecting people to work for 15 hours then it would seem logical that the threshold should be 15 hours at the minimum wage or 180 as things stand sole parents face a marginal tax rate of 50 percent on every dollar they earn over 100 and 90 percent on earnings of over 180
3142816 long term welfare dependency locks people into a life of limited income and limited choices
3142817 were really indicating that those people are the ones we are going to encourage to undertake 15 hours part time work or training or be at least looking for work

3142824 do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves
3142825 newer countries with emerging cultures such as the us and australia seem to use international performance as a way of reinforcing their presence and importance on the world stage
3142826 so for them its very black and white winning and losing is the only thing that matters
3142827 maybe we missed this but we werent aware that whinging is an olympic sport
3142828 mate ive been living with that other blokes name for years it doesnt worry me at all ive always been brad let him change his name
3142829 to play 21 years and not play in a premiership is of course youre going to feel unfulfilled about that
3142830 when i did it last wednesday its the first thing you think of
3142831 the last four or five years before ive retired ive been playing from year to year but weve always been in the hunt for the premiership in that year and ive felt weve been pretty close every year
3142832 so the first thing when i announced my retirement last week was that unfulfilled feeling of maybe never playing in a grand final
3142833 we knew collingwood would come out after the week they had but for us to play like we did was very very disappointing and something with three weeks to go weve got to do something about
3142834 the clubs have too many vested and conflicting interests and are not equipped to deal with these issues consistently
3142835 sadly that is compromising the values and the brand of afl football
3142836 what penalties can the afl tribunal impose financial incarceration the death penalty
3142837 it is incredulous that mr jackson thinks it acceptable that after legal process has taken place afl players should face further deliberation by an afl appointed tribunal
3142838 while plaintiffs maintain that some members of the alleged class bought from boa in private placements they concede that none of the named plaintiffs themselves did so
3142839 the stocks were so oversold last year and for most of this year
3142840 i think youre seeing the cloud lift with oil prices drop the 4 gas price was really crimping into consumers ability to spend
3142841 the people who have been taking the money out of oil have to go somewhere and these stocks are cheap cheap cheap
3142842 we currently believe this is more likely a 2010 event rather we believe a smaller version of the 13 inch macbook air is likely in the 2009 timeframe
3142843 apple is clearly leveraging its technology portfolio from the iphone to improve the mac experience as well and we believe apple will continue to add multitouch gestures to its notebooks

3142854 i have large boobs and a sizable a so i guess the title comes with the territory but i just play tennis i always try to look my best even though its hard to look your best when youre sweating grunting and making faces i never look my best when playing
3142855 im attracted to guys who are really athletic so its never a problem to be honest i absolutely hate working out i hate going to the gym i do it only cause its my job and i think about it like ok other peoples jobs are to go to the office nine to five and my job is to go the gym and look sexy thats the only thing that gets me through it
3142856 i love my smile my smile and my cleavage laughs i think they go really well together
3142857 it definitely makes it harder which is not really cool because i

3142862 los juegos tambi n tienen un significado para m ya que ser n mis dos ltimas carreras oficiales por ello quiero disfrutar y si llega un buen resultado en forma de medalla mejor esa es mi intenci n sobre todo no me gustar a retirarme dando una mala sensaci n el resultado es algo secundario en una prueba tan complicada como sta no obstante aspiro a todo
3142863 es bastante mejor que en sydney o en atenas donde las dos pruebas estaban m s juntas
3142864 la preparaci n es b sicamente la misma de siempre
3142865 me preocupan sobre todo las largas distancias entre la villa y el vel dromo as como la dificultad para entrenar en bicicleta en las calles de pek n
3142866 habr poco tiempo para descansar y muchas dificultades para los traslados

3142869 what was thought to be a safe transit route doesnt look as safe as a few weeks ago
3142870 and the anxiety is not likely to dissipate when the crisis ends
3142871 a new iron curtain is descending around the periphery of russia any chance of a new non russian pipeline out of central asia and into europe is pretty much dead
3142872 russia has demonstrated that its military is a force to reckon with that it can defeat a western trained force and that the west and nato will not act to intervene
3142873 it was just such a horrible feeling it was a feeling of fear
3142874 you never can recoup your total loss in a disaster like this you just cant replace everything
3142875 were obviously excited because we went from no coverage to now were covered
3142876 we still need to sit with metlife and see what that means im still trying to find out what theyll cover
3142877 they worked on this every single day for us it was daily communication and they just went above and beyond
3142878 they had denied it but because of the nature of this incident and the losses and the terrible heartache metlife stepped up and agreed that they would take claims on these three homes
3142879 im familiar with floods and i know the psychological impact and the monetary impact it has on people its tough i saw that when i visited the binney street houses the next day
3142880 thats why i was glad to see the insurance company do the right thing

3142882 they have to maintain that culvert the states not off the hook
3142883 im still trying to pick up the pieces and put my house back together
3142884 bottom line this should have never happened if they only listened to the little people
3142885 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
3142886 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing a complex trait as anxiety still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction

3142897 the color coded campaign why isnt obama doing better in the polls the answer no one wants to hear
3142898 its the thing that nobody wants to talk about but its obviously a huge factor
3142899 why are we then sending them photos of our family or the family newsletter saying oh merry christmas and by the way look at me and my family and we did that was so wonderful
3142900 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
3142901 i dont even want to hear it well take care of business in the pool
3142902 californias central valley already sits at the center of the housing crisis but high prices and contracting incomes are now compounding the foreclosure problem homeowners have mortgages higher than their homes value and the payments have gotten beyond their reach not necessarily because interest rates have risen but because their budgets have tightened
3142903 thats what happened to bob scarpitto he used to donate his time installing pools for needy families on the tv show extreme makeover home edition mr scarpittos pool business dried up last year when banks tightened home equity lending
3142904 he went from a 300 000 salary to zero trying to keep the business afloat with no income and a higher cost of living he lost his modest home to foreclosure he sold everything except a prized boat which he just put on craigslist in april when he had to hand back the keys of his home
3142905 his greatest problem is the tough job market here for anyone connected to the housing sector no one wants to hire a contractor he says
3142906 scarpittos hometown merced now tops the charts with 9 3 percent of first mortgages in delinquency according to figures from economy com stockton sits at 8 6 percent and modesto at 8 3 percent meanwhile incomes in the three cities fell by around 4 percent over the past year in terms of purchasing power according to estimates from andr s carbacho burgos housing economist at moodys economy com
3142907 the tough economy and inflation are piling onto the housing markets woes says merced mayor ellie wooten who is also a real estate agent
3142908 in modesto city housing official barbara kauss worries about a coming third wave of foreclosures the first wave washed over investor properties the second peaking in early july wiped out recent adjustable mortgages whose rates ratcheted up
3142909 a third wave she worries will be people who just truly cant afford the mortgage payment
3142910 the number of troubled homeowners able to sell their houses for less than their debt on the property is increasing the number of houses sold in july in fresno and clovis through short sales totaled 30 up from 19 in june short sales in just those two months topped the 46 in all of 2007 said don scordino president of the fresno association of realtors
3142911 the story is similar in visalia where real estate broker nancy riggs said many banks are organizing short sale divisions to handle the soaring number of requests riggs estimated that 17 of the 800 houses for sale in visalia are potential short sales
3142912 whether those homes close as short sales remains to be seen real estate agents say the process can be difficult time consuming and frustrating by some estimates fewer than 10 of all short sale attempts succeed although realtors expect that percentage to increase
3142913 there is nothing short about a short sale said ken neufeld a london properties agent who is spending a large chunk of time trying to close two of them
3142914 a bank often would rather work with homeowners in structuring some kind of workout or loan modification workouts only succeed if the borrower has a reasonable chance of recovery if there is lost income and they cant make any type of reasonable payment there is no conversation to be had said martha lucey president of a nonprofit financial counseling service in fresno
3142915 patrick prince of westland realty amp investment in fresno is one of the leaders in the area when it comes to short sales completing almost 50 of those he attempts on behalf of sellers and buyers
3142916 prince said a key is to price the property according to its value not the loan amount if the house is worth 300 000 and the loan is 450 000 the bank only cares about the appraisal he said
3142917 the citys block 36 redevelopment project proved to be another casualty of a faltering housing market the city council last week terminated block 36 a redevelopment project slated for the southeast corner of foothill boulevard and azusa avenue
3142918 officials from lowe enterprises the los angeles based developer blamed economic conditions for halting the block 36 project in an e mailed statement
3142919 we think the project we planned is the right thing for the city of azusa and regret that we cannot move forward at this time the statement read
3142920 city manager fran delach said lowe had suggested making the residential units rentals but the city council declined the idea the general feeling was that there are a significant number of apartments in azusa currently delach said
3142921 block 36 also known as azusa village center would have been a mixed use project consisting of floor level retail with 66 residential units above a type of vertical building often seen in dense areas like new york city
3142922 like food pantry operators around the county and across the country kittie fidermutz is being squeezed hit with higher food prices and fewer donations the coordinator of care and share in simi valley has helped more than 800 new families this year
3142923 were seeing people who used to donate food coming in and getting food now fidermutz said were getting hit really hard
3142924 during the first eight months of last year the nonprofit served 1 947 households more than 4 700 individuals compared to 2 762 families or nearly 7 500 people so far this year
3142925 at least in certain markets its a new world for monterey county real estate becky jones can tell by the armload of offers that a 900 square foot seaside home recently attracted
3142926 the bank owned property two bedrooms one bath on a 6 000 square foot lot drew 35 offers within days of being listed the number would certainly have kept climbing she said except that the bank stopped taking new offers
3142927 a buyer jones cant disclose who it is other than to say its a local resident is now in escrow with one of the many offers that topped the 189 000 listed price shes prohibited from disclosing what the top bid was until the sale is completed but the last time the property changed hands in december 2005 it sold for 625 000
3142928 the bulk of sales right now is in the distressed housing market and that is creating opportunities for first time homebuyers and those previously outpriced from the regions housing market according to jones
3142929 but while thats where the flurry of action is these days jones said its not just the foreclosures and the short sales that are creating opportunities traditional sellers have been forced by market shifts to reset price expectations and unlike bank owned properties those homes have been maintained and often upgraded
3142930 ive got homes right now all over the peninsula that people are selling for less than they bought them for said jones
3142931 business confidence in the sonoma county economy fell to its lowest level in nearly a decade and is likely to fall further according to a survey of local executives its important to keep the survey in perspective said ben stone the boards executive director he noted that confidence was at an all time high just two years ago
3142932 weve been on a fantastic boom for several years stone said
3142933 on atree lined street in central napa green lawns in front of modest 1940s era homes paint the typical picture ofmiddle class suburbia
3142934 all seems in order except for the one house with furniture dumped on the lawn and boxes of clothing and other detritus scattered on the driveway
3142935 the two bedroom one bath home on pacific street foreclosed on june 30 to a passerby it seems the residents attempted to make few bucks as an eviction date drew near then gave up as the deadline passed
3142936 unfortunately the trouble isnt isolated to pacific street over the last five months some 209 napa county homes went into foreclosure according to title company reports for all county foreclosures between march 10 and aug 6 2008
3142937 some of the 209 homeowners were less than 10 000 behind in payments according to title company reports a homeowner on michael lane in american canyon was only 2 078 behind a family on tallac street in napa owed 14 242
3142938 others had fallen delinquent by staggering amounts a homeowner on kingsford drive in napa had missed payments totaling 55 530 when the lender foreclosed
3142939 harrison and kilburn avenues and beecham street in napa and via bellagio vine terrace way and rio del mar in american canyon have between two and five foreclosures each
3142940 harrison and kilburn are in westwood three or four years ago values for two and three bedroom single bathroom homes in the neighborhood soared above 400 000 as many residents of the largely latino community sought a place of their own in napa county the majority of newer foreclosed homes are in american canyon
3142941 a huge number of the folks being foreclosed are hispanic said stephen cogswell director of fair housing napa valley sixty percent of hispanic home buyers in 2006 used lenders whose primary business was subprime lending he said
3142942 according to cogswell 2006 was the peak year for subprime loans as these loans mature and interest rates adjust it is likely that we are only beginning to see a portion of the homes on their way to foreclosure said cogswell
3142943 many of the napa county homeowners now in trouble paid between 300 000 and 600 000 for the homes supporting the observation of mike silvas of morgan lane that it is the first time buyers who are most at risk
3142944 the problem is particularly dramatic for american canyon where our numbers show as many as one in 12 homeowners are currently being or have been foreclosed
3142945 a foreclosed home in the rancho del mar neighborhood of american canyon is just one example three years ago the three bedroom one bath home at 211 carolyn dr sold for 465 000 the current listing price 219 900
3142946 times are tough in the real estate market even in the top echelons some properties are languishing one marin county realtor is hoping to kick start the mansion market going after international buyers whose euros carry extra oomph here in the land of the weak dollar
3142947 luxury home realtor and owner olivia hsu decker is running a swank six day event in september for ultra high net worth individuals mostly from overseas to view 30 palatial estates in the bay area
3142948 this black tie affair is a parallel universe version of the foreclosure bus tour in which bargain hunters see discounted bank repos but its born of the same market downturn as these times require a little extra vigor to sell real estate even to the ultra rich
3142949 even in this upper crust market its slowed down decker admits
3142950 when the market is good we can sit here waiting for local people to buy we didnt do that much marketing out there she said
3142951 prospective buyers will be wined and dined by sponsors such as bentley and first republic bank and chauffeured to tour such properties as an english tudor style mega mansion in los altos hills 38 million and a tuscan villa in tiburon 15 million
3142952 these are really glorified open houses decker said in a dry understatement
3142953 we cant help the fact that the market is what it is right now on new suvs joe and iree borges sold their house and brought a 40 foot rv in 2001 it made perfect sense the santa maria couple had retired after all and they wanted to see the country i didnt want to retire to mow a lawn joe borges said initially the couple traveled to places like oregon washington montana wyoming and south dakota but with the price of diesel fuel soaring to 5 a gallon their home on wheels is parked a lot more these days if fuel prices stay the way they are right now or even go up a little higher as they say they may in a couple more years i dont know what were going to do
3142954 the tough economy and inflation are piling onto the housing markets woes says merced mayor ellie wooten who is also a real estate agent

3142960 at 19 years 15 percent of runners had died compared with 34 percent of controls
3142961 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se
3142962 it is the regular physical vigorous activity that is important
3142963 over time all groups decreased running activity but the runners groups continued to accumulate more minutes per week of vigorous activity of all kinds
3142964 members of the running groups had significantly lower mean disability levels at all time points
3142965 almost all of them did something else they continued their vigorous exercise
3142966 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3142967 the rumors come up every couple of months and every time nothing happens
3142968 the problem is that a deal makes sense fedex needs tnt and ups could use it so thats why tnts shares react
3142969 eventually i am convinced there will be a deal but in the meantime its like the little boy who cried wolf
3142970 recently there has been increased press speculation about first fedex and now ups purchasing all of tnt or its express division
3142971 we believe at this point there remains little evidence of such a deal occurring
3142972 were allowed to text out of school like on school grounds outside in the parking lot
3142973 its really best to tell kids when you are texting you know devote your attention to texting go to a safe place and do it rather than trying to operate a vehicle or a bike or walking
3142974 his cell phone stays locked in his trunk until he stops the car if he gets caught texting or talking on the cell phone his license will be taken away for at least a month
3142975 he does not see me do those kinds of things
3142976 among teens and young adults in particular who are arriving in emergency departments with serious and sometimes fatal injuries because they were not paying attention while texting
3142977 we see this every day since we are in downtown chicago with lots of people walking around
3142978 people are texting and they trip and fall on their faces usually people in their 20s we see a lot of face chin mouth and eye injuries from falls
3142979 some people are actually on chicagos busy lakefront path texting while walking or exercising
3142980 we see people rollerblading or biking while texting they are usually very skilled but sometimes crash and fall when they are not watching where they are going
3142981 in march we were driving and saw a woman in her twenties step off the curb and get struck square by a pickup truck
3142982 she was unconscious and it appeared shed suffered a massive brain injury you could tell she saw the truck at the last moment because her cell phone was dropped right where she was struck just off the curb and she was thrown about 20 or 30 feet it was horrifying the truck stopped the driver was devastated i was amazed to hear she survived all the way to trauma center but died in the er
3142983 he was distracted and was killed as he crossed the road
3142984 in ireland the government developed advertising specifically targeted at teens for this very reason
3142985 the bottom line is to be aware of potential safety concerns and to simply exercise caution restraint and good judgment at all times when using a cell phone or blackberry
3142986 weve never quite understood nicholas negropontes position when it comes to the 100 laptop olpc xo
3142987 generally we have always had clarity but mike masnick has always been prominently ignorant
3142988 while the idea behind creating a super cheap super durable useful computer for children in developing nations is good
3142989 just try to build a machine using ots retail or even oem parts and software if you do a truly apples to apples build your cost will be higher than buying that machine from a dell or hp or similar reseller
3142990 im sure you could have figured it out if only you had the idea to try
3142991 woman therefore confused and pitiable muslim therefore dangerous and without pity
3142992 a major factor in this increase has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts
3142993 if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
3142994 my read was that the westerners felt shame in those situations but they were inhibiting those responses and i think that is supported by the blind findings
3142995 in american and other western cultures were taught from a very early age not to show shame its stigmatized whereas in the east its appropriate to show shame in a major olympic failure for instance
3142996 with pride the original function may have been actually if i make myself larger that tells others im someone to watch out for
3142997 over the course of evolution humans would acquire the innate propensity to associate this display with success
3142998 there are many times where its not that adaptive to show shame essentially youre saying i just screwed up
3142999 but if you really feel yourself weaker than an adversary and you could convey that that you agree youre more powerful than me i submit to you dont hurt me and we both save resources compared to if we had to fight my guess is thats why its still around
3143000 here are people who have never seen people express this
3143001 the only possible explanation you could make is well maybe their parents physically move their bodies in this way to teach them given the specificity of the response were not just talking about a simple arm stretch but chest expansion and shoulders pulling back and everything to me that seems like a less parsimonious suggestion than it being innate
3143002 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful
3143003 people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3143004 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3143005 both the fungus and the birds eat chilies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
3143006 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3143007 by contrast peppers increase their chemical defense levels or heat as they ripen
3143008 in the north any adaptive benefit to using eating chilies would be much smaller than at the equator because microbial infection of food is less common and its easier to keep food cold maybe thats why food in the north can be so boring
3143009 along the equator without access to refrigeration you could be dead pretty quickly unless you can find a way to protect yourself against the microbes you ingest every day
3143010 after taking a close look at the candidates in this race i was more impressed by senator clintons ability to meet the challenges of the presidency end the war reinvigorate the economy and provide universal healthcare

3143014 were not familiar with the purpose of their trip i cant say because we dont know what the agenda was
3143015 we hope it will impact how cities look at their trees
3143016 obviously a lot of cities havent yet stepped back and said why do we do this the way we do it
3143017 we need to look at ordinances across multiple states and see if there are common features we havent done that

3143027 we had a nice silvery light with a thin layer of clouds today
3143028 but although the even light is beautiful it also poses some difficulties because your values are often close together on a day like this it is much more difficult to convey the direction of light when the light is even you have to take a more sensitive approach to temperature rather than concentrate on strong shifts in value
3143029 as the sun moves in and out you have to decide which type of light you want
3143030 for instance if you want a softer effect and sunlight hitting your scene are you going to keep waiting for the sun to break through the clouds before you make your value judgments or will you wait until the sun goes behind the clouds to make those comparisons
3143031 painting in a public urban setting requires both being aware of your surroundings and being considerate of others
3143032 you need to set up your equipment in a place where your easel wont be knocked into or tripped over by passersby and try to stay out of peoples way also in a big city like chicago you have to strap everything together so nothing gets taken there are also safety been in a situation where i was standing a little too close to the edge of the sidewalk and was nearly knocked in the head by a buss mirror as it went whizzing by
3143033 more so than in other areas of chicago people in the neighborhood of humboldt park are curious about what were doing one evening this past summer while i was doing a quick painting some kids came by including one charming little girl who offered me a quarter to paint her a picture of the lagoon
3143034 the information you get from painting outdoors such as the effects of color light and atmosphere is simply not available when you look through a camera
3143035 the camera does things that are alien to the visual experience of standing outside such as flattening things out and distorting edges especially if youre using a camera with a smaller aperture it has such a great depth of field that every edge is equally sharp no matter how far away it is
3143036 also when we look at things we experience peripheral vision but the camera doesnt
3143037 and we also experience gazing for example there are certain things you can best see by not looking directly at them such as the pleiades constellation if you look straight at it in the night sky it fades away and you cant see it but if you look 10 to 15 degrees to the side it becomes sharper there are actually a number of optical tricks or illusions one can best experience by gazing at them
3143038 weve gone out in 20 degree days in the snow with a 10 below wind chill factor and weve also painted through rainstorms
3143039 i tell artists painting in the rain that when the canvas is covered with oil the water will not mix with it if its a harder rain its easier to see your canvas because the water will drop off quicker but if its mistier youll end up with little water droplets all over so i usually lay a piece of viva paper towel over the top of it and blow on the backside the paper towel absorbs the drops making it easier to see your canvas again
3143040 there are certainly some difficulties and obstacles involved with painting outdoors in an urban environment
3143041 but the only way youre going to accurately capture the energy and passion of the city youre painting is if you fully immerse yourself in it
3143042 its a long way to the top if you wanna rock n roll

3143045 sunt elemente de care justitia din romania nu se poate dispensa
3143046 in perioada mai iunie a anului acesta cand au avut loc cresterile succesive de preturi la pompa am pierdut pana la 10 din vanzari vorbim de un consumator foarte sensibil mult mai afectat de preturile la pompa decat vecinii din regiune in pofida faptului ca se vorbeste despre cresteri salariale peste media europeana puterea de cumparare este extrem de redusa in luna iulie dupa 4 micsorari consecutive de preturi am reusit sa crestem vanzarile cu aproximativ 7 fata de aceeasi perioada a anului trecut
3143047 primul semn al senzitivitatii consumatorului roman fata de cresterea preturilor la petrol a fost scaderea numarului de masini vandute o parte din romani renunta deja la luxul de a detine un autoturism pentru ca inevitabil se gandesc la cheltuielile ulterioare de aici incolo efectul este vizibil in scaderea vanzarilor la pompa pentru ca o parte renunta la alimentari nu am resimtit acest lucru in nivelul afacerilor pentru ca barilul de petrol ne a acoperit scaderile de volum prin plusul fara precedent de valoare
3143048 au intervenit diferte mecanisme financiare care au domolit aceasta volatilitate a pretului pe baril au fost numeroase incercari administrative de a stopa tranzactiile futures in sua ceea ce a redus de trei ori numarul participantilor de astfel de speculatii la aceasta s a adaugat si declinul economic raportat de mai multe tari ceea ce a dus implicit la o scadere a cererii practic am asistat la o retragere a traderilor pe petrol s au speriat acum nu se mai joaca pe contracte de lunga durata pretul barilului nu va depasi pragul de 150 de dolari pana la sfarsitul anului dar cred ca se va situa in jurul valorii de 120 125 de dolari ceea ce pentru noi inseamna atingerea obiectivelor propuse
3143049 anul trecut lukoil romania a fost desemnata ca fiind cea mai buna filiala la nivelul intregului grup s au luat in calcul mai multi factori pornind de la rezultatele economice pana la starea sociala a angajatilor sau la masurile de protectia muncii implementate
3143050 suntem in grafic si cu planurile pentru acest an care prevad vanzarea a aproximativ 800 000 de tone prin statiile de distributie cred ca totusi vom vinde cu 2 3 procente mai putin catre terti comparativ cu anul trecut
3143051 nu ar avea sens sa inchiriezi in alta parte a lumii
3143052 avem o concentrare pe clienti foarte mari dar de exemplu banca romaneasca este un client mediu care s a regasit in serviciile noastre un client mic nu este neaparat usor de gestionat si este necesar sa ai prezenta in toate categoriile de clienti
3143053 estimam o crestere organica semnificativa dar si o crestere datorata noilor clienti
3143054 avem o concentrare pe clienti foarte mari dar de exemplu banca romaneasca este un client mediu care s a regasit in serviciile noastre un client mic nu este neaparat usor de gestionat si este necesar sa ai prezenta in toate categoriile de clienti
3143055 am avut cativa ani de crestere importanta si 2007 a fost un an in care am vrut sa ne stabilizam sa aducem standarde si servicii din afara tarii ceea ce ne a creat premisele unei cresteri semnificative in 2008
3143056 the first half of 2008 was characterised by difficult market conditions and by rising competition brd adapted to this climate and responded with adequate commercial measures also continuing the implementation of strategic policies to improve the it infrastructure and develop distribution channels
3143057 brd ramane cea mai eficienta si mai profitabila banca romaneasca
3143058 concretizarea unor strategii de preluare pe fondul fortarii sistematice a scaderii preturilor la actiunile urmarite este dependenta si de forta si disponibilitatea detinatorilor de actiuni daca ei sunt constienti de strategie si nu sunt foarte dependenti de veniturile asteptate de la investitia in titluri bursiere atunci o astfel de strategie este sortita esecului
3143059 pentru anul in curs s a alocat un buget pentru investitii in valoare de aproximativ 11 mil lei suma care va fi orientata spre dezvoltarea de noi solutii informatice si dezvoltarea canalelor alternative de distributie

3143122 primul semn al senzitivitatii consumatorului roman fata de cresterea preturilor la petrol a fost scaderea numarului de masini vandute o parte din romani renunta deja la luxul de a detine un autoturism pentru ca inevitabil se gandesc la cheltuielile ulterioare de aici incolo efectul este vizibil in scaderea vanzarilor la pompa pentru ca o parte renunta la alimentari nu am resimtit acest lucru in nivelul afacerilor pentru ca barilul de petrol ne a acoperit scaderile de volum prin plusul fara precedent de valoare

3143214 i was reading a little today in that lovely old bible you gave me abu ramiz
3143215 its not the religious message you see god knows if there were no bible and no koran how much happier would our troubled little town be if the famous star had shone for the wise men above lets say baghdad instead of bethlehem life would be much brighter here

3143223 i can say what i feel about the martyrs brigades because i have a big clan here they wouldnt threaten me unless they were prepared to face the anger of half of dehaisha but you george youre a christian you dont have the same protection
3143224 maybe ive lived too long away from here to accept things
3143225 perhaps i just cant forget what you taught me about living a principled life
3143226 you know who else has returned to bethlehem from our old crowd

3143229 ill go to the church and say hello to elias as soon as i get a chance

3143316 sinti en su boca el suave olor de la fiebre y lo aspiro como si quisiera llenarse de las intimidades de su cuerpo y en ese momento se imagin que ya llevaba muchos a os en su casa y que se estaba muriendo de pronto tuvo la clara sensaci n que no podr a sobrevivir a la muerte de ella se acostar a a su lado y querr a morir con ella conmovido por esa imagen hundi en ese momento la cara en la almohada junto a la cabeza de ella y permaneci as durante mucho tiempo y le dio pena que en una situaci n como aquella en la que un hombre de verdad ser a capaz de tomar inmediatamente una decisi n l dudase privando as de su significado al momento mas hermoso que hab a vivido jam s estaba arrodillado junto a su cama y pensaba que no podr a sobrevivir a su muerte se enfad consigo mismo pero luego se le ocurri que en realidad era bastante natural que no supiera que quer a el hombre nunca puede saber que debe querer porque vive solo una vida y no tiene modo de compararla con sus vidas precedentes ni de enmendarla en sus vidas posteriores no existe posibilidad alguna de comprobar cual de las decisiones es la mejor porque no existe comparaci n alguna el hombre lo vive todo a la primera y sin preparaci n como si un actor representase su obra sin ning n tipo de ensayo pero que valor puede tener la vida si el primer ensayo para vivir es ya la vida misma por eso la vida parece un boceto pero ni un boceto es la palabra precisa porque un boceto es siempre un borrador de algo la preparaci n para un cuadro mientras que el boceto que es nuestra vida es un boceto para nada un borrador sin cuadro si cada uno de los instantes de nuestra vida se va a repetir infinitas veces estamos clavados a la eternidad como jesucristo a la cruz la imagen es terrible en el mundo del eterno retorno descansa sobre cada gesto el peso de una insoportable responsabilidad ese es el motivo por el cual nietzsche llam a la idea del eterno retorno la carga m s pesada pero si el eterno retorno es la carga m s pesada entonces nuestras vidas pueden aparecer sobre ese tel n de fondo en toda su maravillosa levedad la carga m s pesada nos destroza somos derribados por ella nos aplasta contra la tierra pero en la poes a amatoria de todas las pocas la mujer desea cargar con el peso del cuerpo del hombre la carga m s pesada es por lo tanto a la vez la imagen de la m s intensa plenitud de la vida cuanto m s pesada sea la carga m s a ras de tierra estar nuestra vida m s real y verdadera ser por el contrario la ausencia absoluta de carga hace que el hombre se vuelva m s ligero que el aire vuele hacia lo alto se distancie de la tierra de su ser terreno que sea real s lo a medias y sus movimientos sean tan libres como insignificantes

3143522 it is considered more likely than not mr quigley would not have died at the time he did were it not for the traumatic event that occured
3143523 he deserved it he tried to rape me he hope he dies
3143524 he had to deal with his passenger trying to get out of the car and make off without paying for the trip
3143525 the driver was able to restrain the passenger so the police could be called
3143526 but the passenger was having none of it and repeatedly struggled to break free
3143527 so anxious indeed was the passenger to break free and thus get away without paying for his trip that the driver was left with multiple bruises and abrasions to his face torso and arms
3143528 the driver was 72 year old raymond quigley the passenger was this defendant then 17
3143529 patterson continued to try and get away for upward of ten minutes
3143530 all mr quigley was trying to do was get him to stay where he was
3143531 but unfortunately this defendant struggled so violently mr quigley suffered a heart attack
3143532 it is not suggested that the defendant intended to kill mr quigley or even to do him really serious harm if that was our case he would be facing a charge of murder
3143533 it is submitted on behalf of the crown the violence he used towards mr quigley was unlawful and directly caused mr quigleys death
3143534 it is considered more likely than not mr quigley would not have died at the time he did were it not for the traumatic event that occured
3143535 put more simply this man had a heart condition but were it not for what happened against that railing mr quigley would not have died between 3 45 and 4am that morning

3143558 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3143559 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3143560 it should simply be plunge and move on plunge and move on
3143561 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3143562 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3143563 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3143564 this is one of the reasons why im so in love with you
3143565 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3143566 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3143567 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3143568 if everything goes well i think in a couple days

3143573 hes got that kind of demeanour that you need on the ryder cup team

3143609 is that the founders of these disciplines envisioned the same thing that you have this broad dispersal of all of the organisms that each happened to be studying and that they would colonize the surface of the earth depending on whether the environment was suitable for them
3143610 before now all biologists could do was look at the biodiversity of microbes that could be cultured in a petri dish we now know that the vast majority of microbial life cannot be kept in captivity now we have the ability to grab dna from the environment and try to characterize different species or taxonomic groups using genetic material allowing our field to blast off
3143611 we are just beginning to scratch the surface of what these patterns look like
3143612 was that the diversity gradient more correlated with temperature than primary productivity
3143613 sackler colloquium in the light of evolution biodiversity and extinction
3143614 from our study we saw that environmental selection seemed to play a larger role and was more important for microbes than the plants
3143615 you have to be careful about the conclusions that you make
3143616 so on a 2 000 meter elevation gradient for example the spatial scale relative to the body size of a plant is much much larger when you consider what the universe looks like to a microbe
3143617 diversity patterns on mountainsides have been studied mostly on plants and animals for hundreds of years
3143618 yet microbes are the most diverse set of organisms on earth and they are really important for how ecosystems work our study establishes the first elevation gradient pattern for microbes we found that yes microbes do have a diversity pattern that is similar to what has been studied for plants and animals but the pattern is different than what you see for plants in the rockies and there is much to be done to understand why microbes might have a different biodiversity pattern
3143619 i dont think that microbes are fundamentally different from a biological standpoint from plants and animals i think that we havent figured out how to study them in an analogous way

3143672 theyre in combat outposts because these are difficult areas where the insurgents have a reasonable grip
3143673 the only other option is you leave the population completely uncovered and you leave them completely at the mercy of the taliban and thats not what were here to do were here to bring security to the people so its tough theres no question its tough and every time we have a loss like this it has a big effect

3143700 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3143701 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

3143704 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3143705 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3143706 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3143707 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3143708 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3143709 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3143710 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3143711 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3143712 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3143713 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3143714 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3143715 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3143716 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3143717 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3143718 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3143719 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3143720 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3143721 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3143722 we hear from some users who really appreciate the benefits of relevant advertising and some who prefer not to receive this type of marketing so we decided to offer transparency and choice about the options that are available to all users
3143723 greatest asset so we strive to create the most trusted compelling experience online
3143724 we moved up the announcement date in order to let congress know about the options available to consumers
3143725 confident that consumers are responding to the customization of online content and they would prefer relevant advertising that saves them time and money
3143726 we believe that consumers are seeking online networks that offer that customization within a relationship of trust in that sense we believe that we create more business value by offering transparency and choice in our
3143727 this is a small fraction of a percent of our total user base
3143728 our survey illustrates that u s online consumers want choice and control when it comes to personal information that is collected about them by giving users the option to choose idc believes the site will build greater trust with users and that the majority will not opt out of these services if they trust the site
3143729 yahoo is taking the high road here to build trust realizing that so far most of its users have not actually gone through the steps of opting out of targeted
3143730 after kicking ass with all our metal friends on mayhem this past summer we knew that our next step had to be massive and after a list of brilliant projects we had the opportunity to tour with we have put together an annihilating bill this fall death punch will be charging back through the states with one of metals premiere front women in this moment the crushing sounds of long time underground bad asses bury your dead and some stellar newcomers another black day we are pulling out all the stops and we are taking no prisoners
3143731 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3143732 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3143733 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3143734 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3143735 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3143736 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3143737 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3143738 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3143739 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3143740 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3143741 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3143742 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3143743 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3143744 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3143745 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3143746 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3143747 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3143748 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3143749 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3143750 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3143751 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3143752 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3143753 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3143754 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3143755 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3143756 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3143757 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3143758 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3143759 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3143760 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3143761 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3143762 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3143763 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3143764 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3143765 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3143766 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3143767 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3143768 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3143769 our main goal is to create a user friendly site with the best classic pc games for a price that might be considered impossible to achieve

3143772 he had a real sense of himself as working class
3143773 he always said i am a worker not middle class like they say today
3143774 employers violate workers rights every time we try to organize
3143775 its the fear of being deported that makes people afraid
3143776 the launch of the apple app store allows consumers to easily discover and download games for their mobile devices
3143777 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3143778 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3143779 they promised not to be mean and i had to trust them im not going to have a heart attack i take what i do very seriously and i think there is a lesson to be learned in every segment but contrary to popular opinion i do have a sense of humor
3143780 i think that 20 somethings and 30 somethings will watch this show and laugh along but still come away learning something my die hard fans might get upset if they do then they just shouldnt watch it

3143788 what the russians just did is for the first time since the fall of the soviet union they have taken a decisive military action and imposed a military reality
3143789 theyve done it unilaterally and all of the countries that have been looking to the west to intimidate the russians are now forced into a position to consider what just happened
3143790 there is no possibility of drawing nato or the international community into this
3143791 strategically the russians have been sending signals that they really wanted to flex their muscles and theyre upset about kosovo

3143798 strategically the russians have been sending signals that they really wanted to flex their muscles and theyre upset about kosovo
3143799 if someone went to the russians and said ok kosovo for iran wed have a deal
3143800 weve placed ourselves in a position that globally we dont have the wherewithal to do anything

3143813 la estrategia de georgia es un acto desesperado que sin embargo le ha permitido alcanzar su objetivo de internacionalizaci n del conflicto con un coste econ mico enorme
3143814 es evidente que los soldados de paz rusos en la regi n ya no son soldados de paz
3143815 la guerra ha tenido lugar porque las posibilidades de acordar a georgia el estatuto de candidato a la otan el pr ximo diciembre fecha del pr ximo consejo de la alianza no eran cre bles
3143816 georgia siempre ha presentado la otan como un aliado es la manera para este peque o estado de intentar imponerse ante rusia
3143817 la otan siempre ha sido utilizada por georgia sin que haya habido nunca protestas oficiales
3143818 las perspectivas de una entrada de georgia en la otan se han reducido brutalmente
3143819 si un estado miembro de la otan empezara a hacer una pol tica como la de georgia para hacer avanzar sus prioridades ser a fatal para la organizaci n
3143820 esta guerra aleja a georgia no s lo de europa sino que complica a n m s el consejo de la otan de diciembre la ampliaci n de la otan a georgia debe ser postergada
3143821 a ra z de la situaci n actual no debe tenerse la impresi n de que ahora georgia est excluida por tiempo indefinido de una adhesi n a la otan

3143823 historians will come to view aug 8 2008 as a turning point no less significant than nov 9 1989 when the berlin wall fell russias attack on sovereign georgian territory marked the official return of history indeed to an almost 19th century style of great power competition complete with virulent nationalisms battles for resources struggles over spheres of influence and territory and even though it shocks our 21st century sensibilities the use of military power to obtain geopolitical objectives yes we will continue to have globalization economic interdependence the european union and other efforts to build a more perfect international order but these will compete with and at times be overwhelmed by the harsh realities of international life that have endured since time immemorial the next president had better be ready

3143925 authorities believe some of the buyers are living in mexico and their vineyards are producing tens of thousands of illegal marijuana plants a crop that could easily surpass grapes in value this year in one case drug operatives approached a farmer who didnt have his farm listed for sale he resisted until asked to name a price he threw out a figure 263 000 for 27 acres and no building the buyer showed up a few days later and bought the property in cash
3143926 we then come to the second article that i have attached below about how mexican drug traffickers have taken to a new tactic of buying up precious land that had been used for the cultivation of vineyards to be used to grow marijuana within the borders of the united states
3143927 mike if you accept abusive treatment by anyone you are encouraging that abuse you need to quickly establish limits and make it clear that there are situations that are utterly unacceptable to you by making it clear to those you deal with you will force people to treat you the way you want to be treated

3143935 the occurrence of plant death was obvious to everyone living in that area
3143936 drought certainly stands out as a real likely explanation it is an extremely severe event
3143937 you know they kept pushing and shoving in the last 10 laps pushing and shoving on the back it was just crazy there were cars everywhere i had nowhere to go
3143938 i just hate that it ruined our day and a bunch of other innocent peoples day we had a good solid consistent day going and got into it a little bit with the 00 car too bad it ended our day early
3143939 mcdowell said he didnt realize i was on the outside of him and he kind of came up and put us in the wall it was a disappointing end to a decent day we had going
3143940 we were around each other all day and never touched each other
3143941 it was just one of those deals everybody gets a little impatient there at the end of the race
3143942 i just watched video with david and i apologize to all the fans who had to sit through that red flag
3143943 he and i were racing hard and i got underneath him going in there turn 11 and he pretty much came down like i wasnt there i tried to back out of it not to get into him he went wide so i kept the momentum up it almost looked like he was trying to come back at me
3143944 after watching the video it looked like a racing deal it wasnt anything blatant it just turned into a big mess with all the other cars that got into it david is all right we were just racing hard we were trying to get the car back in the top 35
3143945 they just wanted to make sure that we werent trying to run each other over which we werent
3143946 david knew that i knew that that just wanted to make sure it was a racing deal and that we werent going into michigan next week with a vendetta
3143947 on restarts these tires are pretty slick we found that out at infineon just planning for that and trying to get a good solid run up off the corner and being able to get up through the ss helped out the more we ran the better our car got with grip that was definitely something we could capitalize on too
3143948 i could never get close enough to pass him unfortunately
3143949 i could never get the runs in the right spots
3143950 there were corners we were better than him just not in the right spots we could never get close enough to get an opportunity like marcus said you can dive bomb a guy and probably make something happen but that wasnt the right way we never really close enough to make it right
3143951 i thought yesterday was great but when i would up there on that red flag i realized where i was
3143952 so i just tried to stay clean as best i could and pass cars cleanly and just pick away at it i really had no idea where i was until the last pit stops when we cycled through about sixth place im so proud of the wood brothers giving me a piece that i could really get out there and give it my best
3143953 i was happy we had a good car and we learned a lot at the saturday nationwide race
3143954 i lost a lot of foot brakes as the race got going and the car got real tight the splitter was on the ground a little bit too much but that did foil our strategy
3143955 my team worked really hard we had a good car we were fast in practice lead some of the race just ran out of car strategy got messed up there at the end we should have done something different but i dont know
3143956 we probably lost about 15 seconds on that probably 20 seconds total because there were guys coming in to pit earlier and we needed to pit
3143957 steve crew chief letarte was trying to tell me to pit and i had no idea
3143958 we just had a loose connection and finally they black flagged me but even when i was out there i was trying to fix it and i lost even more time doing that we finally got in there and shoot we came out and we were like 30th the car was a struggle already and the last thing we needed was to lose that much track position
3143959 its the type of track i have a little experience at
3143960 i tested there once in a busch east car i think it would be cool if we do that ill get both races sprint and nationwide in well just have to see it definitely would be fun
3143961 i kind of like the bigger tracks a little bit more than the short tracks nashvilles pretty cool kentuckys cool i kind of have more fun with those i like something new to me and thats sort of why i like them a little bit more to be honest its two different types of racing theyre both fun racings racing
3143962 we are conducting a professional development seminar entitled plug into distance learning each person registering will be provided a copy of our best practices manual to take home however we are now preparing a presentation yes there should be some stuff from manual but we need to also bait the audience with thought provoking questions to invite them into a discussion make them ask questions of themselves and want to go out and learn more not only through our manual but just all over
3143963 should you then seek great things for yourself do not seek them
3143964 everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training they do it to get a crown that will not last but we do it to get a crown that will last forever
3143965 in the winter of 1873 many ho chunk people were removed to the nebraska reservation from wisconsin traveling in cattle cars on trains
3143966 this was a horrific experience for the people as many elders women and children suffered and died
3143967 thats a lot of orbits and that represents a lot of miles and
3143968 its explored entirely new grounds in terms of the ability to see things in detail and what has resulted from that is just marvelous
3143969 something like the hubble deep field which has penetrated far back in time is the kind of thing that wed always hoped to be able to do
3143970 for me its special because i used this to discover the farthest planet that has ever been discovered
3143971 my own program was to discover extrasolar planets at the farthest ranges we can see hst is the only one which can do that
3143972 personally my work in black holes would not have been possible without hst showing that nearly all galaxies contain a massive black hole in their center and that the black hole is an essential component for why galaxies look the way they do
3143973 were still doing good science with it and what appears to threaten its lifetime is not the spacecraft itself but rather our ability to send vehicles up for maintenance
3143974 i would say its biggest legacy would be that wherever it looked with its really broad range of capabilities it found new things many of which people couldnt have even dreamed of
3143975 what is arguably the most important contribution has been the inclusion of the public in the science from hst
3143976 the real contribution from hst has yet to be realized as it has hopefully inspired a generation of scientists to be leaders for the u s and the world
3143977 with the use of the internet to target children a growing problem providing such training offers a real world solution to a significant problem
3143978 this is not only an opportunity to seek justice for victims but also to prevent more children from becoming victims the ncmec is doing outstanding work and we are very proud of this partnership and honored to be part of it
3143979 ultimately a successful fight against sexual exploitation of children will take community efforts with parents educators law enforcement and the courts working together this weeks program is one step toward building that type of community network in our area
3143980 well maybe for some distributors my approach makes them think that maybe its stupid

3143984 this is great i love this for me its perfect
3143985 okay im just going to take what i can get out of this
3143986 and after all of that you still put yourself in the lead
3143987 you have to say to yourself i have a secret
3143988 i want to dress up and look great because its only what he wants its not what i want i want to be myself and express myself and do this or do that
3143989 okay i need this in here and that in here

3143996 make a new kind of movie and people are excited to see a new kind of movie
3143997 sinclair and perez had hit it off in the first room as mr perez polite happy to have the opportunity for distracting conversation and it was revealed to him that mr sinclair does have a lawyer but does not feel as though he is getting his moneys worth
3143998 we think of our employees as part of our fidelity family and we hope that rod has a successful and speedy recovery
3143999 while combined costs for raw materials and energy in the quarter increased 9 million compared with last year we were able to offset more than half of this through higher pricing across our entire portfolio and improved mill efficiencies including important benefits realized from the fox river acquisition we also continue to achieve significant volume growth in key products such as filtration abrasives and environmental fine papers the last despite an unusually large decline in the uncoated free sheet market with the sale of pictou in june we have essentially exited pulp and expect benefits from improved cash flows and return on capital we have now turned our attention to realizing the substantial value from our timberland holdings in nova scotia
3144000 although fuel cells can be used to power things a camera is not a thing hence this crap is patentable
3144001 as a patent examiner im not allowed to post my opinion of patentability but i will say that most cases are heavily modified from their original application form as this one is in now
3144002 the patent covers other electronic devices generally but is clearly directed toward dslr cameras given the diagrams and examples used
3144003 if youre travelling with a child do make sure you fit your own mask first if you have more than one child pick a favourite
3144004 remember that the closest exit may be behind you like a stalker
3144005 cushmans delicious honeybells r and citrus fruits its rich family heritage and its dedication to customer service made this a natural acquisition for us cushman honeybells r join harry amp davids royal riviera r pears and wolfermans r english muffins in our family of nationally recognized brands
3144006 like harry amp david cushmans sells only the finest products and has cultivated an extraordinarily loyal customer base
3144007 our brands are very complementary the entire cushmans team and i look forward to working with everyone at harry amp david to significantly expand cushmans strong direct marketing internet and wholesale businesses
3144008 i am trying to get a car to come back to tbilisi
3144009 they russian troops are intensively bombing tbilisi poti villages in adjara and elsewhere
3144010 overnight as many as 50 russian bombers were reported operating simultaneously over georgia targeting civilian populations in cities and villages as well as radio and telecommunications sites
3144011 we are hearing words of support from all over the world we have very good international positions but it appears this was not enough to stop the barbaric aggressor
3144012 the world just watched from far away and allowed georgia to be occupied in 1921 and they are allowing it now in 2008
3144013 its like when thugs are beating somebody to death in the streets and people are watching from the window shaking their heads in disapproval
3144014 what does this has to do with protecting russian peacekeepers and passports keepers
3144015 the clues are all in the leaflet but not in the right order
3144016 a major factor in this increase has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts
3144017 if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
3144018 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
3144019 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
3144020 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
3144021 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
3144022 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
3144023 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
3144024 uc san diego medical center is a baby friendly hospital which means we encourage breastfeeding as the preferred method of infant nutrition for our newborns
3144025 we are now applying this same model of care to our smallest most vulnerable infants the goal is a better understanding of human milk to achieve healthier preemies who are breastfeeding when they leave our hospital
3144026 the baby is in a doubly difficult situation of dealing with life outside the womb while having a highly immature gastrointestinal system this can lead to major bowel dysfunction or failure while this is a critical time to care for infant this is also a pivotal time to help mom make breastfeeding a priority for the long term health of their child
3144027 while premature infants may not be capable of breastfeeding in the short term we are identifying strategies and techniques to provide the infants the milk and to make the milk available in the long run the data collected from this study will be shared globally with hospitals that would like to adopt similar programs for premature infants
3144028 human breast milk is considered human tissue and is full of carbohydrates lipids vitamins and minerals there are approximately 300 components to breast milk including small biologically active compounds that aid in the formation of the gastrointestinal tract
3144029 the contents vary dramatically from mother to mother and feeding to feeding depending on the babys needs
3144030 we plan to look for correlations between the mothers diet and the nutritional characteristics of the breast milk we may be able to identify certain foods and supplements that aid in the infants growth and development
3144031 fortunately breast milk contains enzymes that help protect against nec
3144032 babies born at one pound have their intestinal development in place but all things attributed to function are either at the earliest phase or have not kicked in at all breast milk has growth factors that affect the ability of the gut to grow and can get the digestion process on track to prevent this dangerous infection
3144033 every second counts for the growth rate of infants especially in the first days when babies are gaining up to 20 grams per kilogram of weight per day
3144034 the brain increases 5 in size every 48 to 72 hours adequate and extra nutrients can improve brain growth which is something the spin program is measuring
3144035 human milk provides benefits that are both nutritional and neurological
3144036 in our life time we will not be able to replicate its biological complexities until that day the best thing for all newborns is breast milk the spin program will help us learn how and why for preemies
3144037 verily who is this child that he opens our hearts and minds to the audacity of hope
3144038 we are extremely pleased to announce the execution of this contract as it aligns our interests with the closest refinery in the region we are excited to establish a relationship with this company and expect the relationship to grow as our production at short junction field increases
3144039 we can only hope that we will be able to do this to stop the aggression
3144040 the attack on tbilisi airport offers further evidence that russias invasion of georgia is not about abkhazia and south ossetia the goal of the russian federation is to overthrow the democratically elected government of this small european nation
3144041 our troops are fighting theyre not letting the russian troops enter in the city of gori
3144042 we have to be realistic here our resources are not unlimited
3144043 is enough to destroy a country ten times bigger than ours
3144044 a very very high representative of a foreign government for a few days
3144045 frankly speaking we do not see any other way of stopping these people
3144046 now they found a place for my children and grandchildren and also my daughter in law and my wife
3144047 we knew something was coming but we didnt know it would be this bad then they started shelling georgian villages we asked the troops for help they came to our rescue and repelled the ossetians attack but this was just the beginning thats when the russians started coming in it was the worst bombing ever worse than in the 1990s when south ossetia fought georgian forces for independence
3144048 in order to prevent the circumstances in which ukraine could be drawn into a military conflict ukraine reserves the right to bar ships which may take part in these actions from returning to the ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved
3144049 i think coburn is one of the hardest working senators and maybe one of the smartest
3144050 people who read a bill and have constructive suggestions ought to be respected rather than criticized what the democrats want to do is intimidate people to give unanimous consent and that is not in the tradition of the senate
3144051 i am proud to have already qualified for the sony ericsson championships
3144052 this 2008 season has been a great year for me as i achieved two of my lifes goals by winning my first grand slam and reaching no 1 in the rankings to win the tournament in doha would be the perfect end to a season that i will never forget
3144053 the real power in shopping for a consumer is in turning my shopping experience into something i enjoy
3144054 we bring to the table a scientific approach to how do we find products that would be relevant to the customer
3144055 bringing the art and the science together the science being the algorithms in the software and the art being the merchandising knowledge
3144056 we see this as a natural online extension to the way you walk about a store youre in the kitchen area and looking at a refrigerator you might look at a freezer next or a different brand or you might head over to the baby section
3144057 the victims were inside their yacht the men boarded and attacked
3144058 we are trying to take away cost as the reason for not having ones pet sterilized
3144059 we estimate our fees are 50 to 75 less than local full service animal hospitals by dedicating our facility to spaying and neutering we dont have to support other hospital services through high surgery fees this enables us to keep our costs down and therefore available to more people so we can make a greater impact
3144060 we perform pre surgical exams on all pets provide quality anesthesia and pain relief medications and utilize sterilized surgical instrument packs for each procedure
3144061 we opened our adoption center in 1989 and have a policy that mandates the spaying or neutering of pets we place
3144062 by opening the affordable spay neuter clinic we can now enforce this policy and take a proactive step to address the ongoing and chronically under addressed problem the control and destruction of cats and dogs due to pet overpopulation
3144063 while our product sales were down due in part to the non renewal of a sales contract with a major customer and partially due to the slow down of purchases from our financial sector customers due to the sub prime debacle our software business has continued to grow
3144064 it does feel like a home tournament for me and it would mean a lot to me to win there
3144065 online publishers are producing more inventory than the market demands and risk devaluing the premium nature of their brands particularly in light of ad networks growth and their dramatically lower pricing
3144066 building more effective relationships between publishers and ad networks is critical in the longer term both parties will benefit from gains in ad network cpms
3144067 what this benchmark study tells the industry is that there is a need for more sophisticated yield management on the part of premium publishers for stronger partnerships between publishers and ad networks for development of best practices and more focus on the value of interactive advertising
3144068 our industry is at an important juncture and now is the time for publishers to adopt strategic approaches to the use of ad networks who themselves have become critical players in the digital ecosystem
3144069 there are so many tournaments throughout the year but the olympics is something special and i am very happy to be representing our country in beijing
3144070 our website is an incredibly important commercial vehicle for us so choosing the right partner to manage our display advertising was a crucial decision perform sales has the skill and expertise to drive the site forward and deliver sustained and impressive results in a very competitive market
3144071 signing a well respected brand such as setanta is a great achievement for perform sales and caps what has been a very exciting period of activity for the company following our recent acquisition of no 9 media and some notable wins we have created a very strong position in the digital sports media market
3144072 we are pleased with the continued strong market demand for our products and services as we achieve higher production levels
3144073 market demand for our recycling services was very good during the quarter as eaf dust receipts increased to a per annum rate of 580 000 tons
3144074 recovery of zinc in the smelting operation improved to 95 from 90 in the prior year quarter and zinc production increased 12 these improvements were over shadowed by the decline in the price of zinc and higher costs associated with energy and maintenance in our operating facilities given the commodity price environment that we are facing we have increased our focus on cost reduction activities
3144075 we are faced with lower zinc prices and rising energy costs therefore our cost reduction focus has accelerated as we have identified and are implementing 35 million in potential cost savings which include a wide range of targeted opportunities throughout the business in particular we are focusing on reducing the price we pay for purchased feeds as a percentage of the lme zinc price we also expect to continue to increase the proportion of eaf dust based feed for our smelting operation our south carolina expansion project is underway but we do not expect to realize the benefit of this increased eaf dust processing capacity until late next year in addition we believe that there is an opportunity to realize higher value from the iron units recovered from eaf dust we currently recycle approximately 175 000 tons of iron into the aggregate market we are targeting the higher value iron and steel markets which have been experiencing a significant increase in the price of pig iron steel scrap and scrap substitutes
3144076 the true measure of education is not what you know but how you decide to share what you know with others
3144077 our results in the second quarter stemmed mainly from significant deterioration in u s residential mortgage performance that adversely affected the asset backed collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage backed securities we insured
3144078 last week we achieved an important milestone in our restructuring process by completing the previously announced transactions with xl capital and merrill lynch which strengthened our capital position and removed from our insured portfolio some of the exposures of greatest concern to us to reduce the risk of further adverse loss development we are continuing to work with our remaining credit default swap counterparties in an effort to commute or restructure the exposures we have to them we also remain committed to exploring ways to place our public finance business on a more stable footing going forward
3144079 i am however tibetan before i am dalai lama and i am human before i am tibetan
3144080 on behalf of the board of directors wed like to thank paul for his service and dedication during his tenure as chief executive officer we greatly appreciate his hard work over the past few months which resulted in the successful completion of the first phase of syncoras critical restructuring initiatives the entire board joins me in wishing paul every success in his future endeavors
3144081 i wish to thank the board of directors and my colleagues at syncora for their extraordinary effort and commitment over the last few months with the successful completion of the first phase of the restructuring behind us i fully understand and agree with the boards decision that now is the right time for new leadership to take the company forward
3144082 i wish everyone at syncora the best of success for the future
3144083 susan has played an instrumental role in helping navigate the company during these challenging times her leadership and insight have been critical in terms of stabilizing the company and working constructively with the regulators and third parties to execute the first phase of the restructuring process susan brings a deep knowledge of our industry significant business acumen and importantly a steady hand to help guide syncora and its employees as we work toward completing the next phase of the companys restructuring plan
3144084 i look forward to working with the board and management team as we work towards successfully executing the next phase of the companys restructuring efforts
3144085 not going to grow as much as expected but its still going to be growing more than other media
3144086 advertisers have pulled back in a pretty meaningful way and display is feeling the brunt of it
3144087 macroeconomic weakness in the u s and its impact on advertising spending
3144088 continued to experience softness in display advertising from several of our largest financial advertisers
3144089 the old model of advertising you create something and buy the space to put it in just isnt working
3144090 id be the first to insist that modeling christian virtues not least in the home is of paramount importance the worst sort of home to be brought up in is the one where spiritual pretensions are high and performance is low the best sort of home is the one where spiritual pretensions are low and performance is high that was the kind of home in which i was reared
3144091 in our time political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible things like the continuance of british rule in india the russian purges and deportations the dropping of the atom bombs on japan can indeed be defended but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face and which do not square with the professed aims of political parties thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism question begging and sheer cloudy vagueness defenceless villages are bombarded from the air the inhabitants driven out into the countryside the cattle machine gunned the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets this is called pacification
3144092 i never use a metaphor simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print
3144093 objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account
3144094 by using stale metaphors similes and idioms you save much mental effort at the cost of leaving your meaning vague not only for your reader but for yourself

3144098 i am very pleased with our results for the quarter our strategy has been to develop a blended portfolio whereby we balance our revenue between more stable developed economies and rapidly growing markets that provide cascal with tremendous growth opportunities during the quarter we achieved solid revenue growth of 12 a majority of which was the result of organic growth and maintained strong ebitda margins within our target range around 40 percent

3144109 get them all in a room or on a conference call and have regular meetings
3144110 identify if outsiders need to be brought in such as outside counsel with relative expertise in this area outside communications firms for damage control and how to do notification and forensics firms to do cross checking to see what data is missing
3144111 in the projects i see notifications are generally being held until the company hit by a breach has a good handle on what happened
3144112 in general the next step after convening everyone in house would be exploring law enforcement notification and concurrent with all of this you should get the data analysis going and plan how youre doing to address it to the public
3144113 im a firm believer in proactive dealings with law enforcement have law enforcement come talk to your company
3144114 protect your rights above all obey the law above all but show respect and dont play games with law enforcement because nobody wins doing that
3144115 the biggest issue is trying to work through the understandable instinct in house to want to keep it quiet

3144126 our cremations in total volume with our funeral homes have doubled and thats primarily due to the cost of ground burial and entombment
3144127 the feeling is that if the cemeteries dont turn to offer more cremation services that theyre going to go out of business that more and more people are looking for that
3144128 you can scatter in the ocean scatter on the mountain we have a variety of glass front niches we have outdoor cremation gardens today
3144129 they dont need to do the same elsewhere simply because what is happening in georgia has already driven home the message that what happens in these russian enclaves wherever they are is for russia to determine and no one else
3144130 the message is you do not touch any of them because the russian military is determined to defend them even if it means crossing an international border with their tanks
3144131 absolutely no doubt that one of his key calculations was ukraine

3144155 this very small evolutionary change allows farmers to kill grassy weeds without affecting their crops
3144156 am i going to see a blue screen of death
3144157 is that the founders of these disciplines envisioned the same thing that you have this broad dispersal of all of the organisms that each happened to be studying and that they would colonize the surface of the earth depending on whether the environment was suitable for them
3144158 before now all biologists could do was look at the biodiversity of microbes that could be cultured in a petri dish we now know that the vast majority of microbial life cannot be kept in captivity now we have the ability to grab dna from the environment and try to characterize different species or taxonomic groups using genetic material allowing our field to blast off
3144159 we are just beginning to scratch the surface of what these patterns look like
3144160 was that the diversity gradient more correlated with temperature than primary productivity
3144161 sackler colloquium in the light of evolution biodiversity and extinction
3144162 from our study we saw that environmental selection seemed to play a larger role and was more important for microbes than the plants
3144163 you have to be careful about the conclusions that you make
3144164 so on a 2 000 meter elevation gradient for example the spatial scale relative to the body size of a plant is much much larger when you consider what the universe looks like to a microbe
3144165 diversity patterns on mountainsides have been studied mostly on plants and animals for hundreds of years
3144166 yet microbes are the most diverse set of organisms on earth and they are really important for how ecosystems work our study establishes the first elevation gradient pattern for microbes we found that yes microbes do have a diversity pattern that is similar to what has been studied for plants and animals but the pattern is different than what you see for plants in the rockies and there is much to be done to understand why microbes might have a different biodiversity pattern
3144167 i dont think that microbes are fundamentally different from a biological standpoint from plants and animals i think that we havent figured out how to study them in an analogous way
3144168 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3144169 both the fungus and the birds eat chilies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
3144170 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3144171 having such a specific defense one that doesnt harm reproduction or dispersal is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant and i think it is a great example of the power of natural selection
3144172 by contrast peppers increase their chemical defense levels or their heat as they ripen this is a very different model and peppers can get away with it because birds dont sense pain when they eat capsaicin
3144173 i think a lot of plants would love to come up with this way of stopping fungal growth without inhibiting dispersers its just very hard to do
3144174 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3144175 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3144176 in the north any adaptive benefit to using eating chilies would be much smaller than at the equator because microbial infection of food is less common and its easier to keep food cold maybe thats why food in the north can be so boring
3144177 along the equator without access to refrigeration you could be dead pretty quickly unless you can find a way to protect yourself against the microbes you ingest every day
3144178 a major factor in this increase has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts
3144179 if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
3144180 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
3144181 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
3144182 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
3144183 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
3144184 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body

3144190 human breast milk is considered human tissue and is full of carbohydrates lipids vitamins and minerals there are approximately 300 components to breast milk including small biologically active compounds that aid in the formation of the gastrointestinal tract
3144191 the contents vary dramatically from mother to mother and feeding to feeding depending on the babys needs
3144192 we plan to look for correlations between the mothers diet and the nutritional characteristics of the breast milk we may be able to identify certain foods and supplements that aid in the infants growth and development
3144193 fortunately breast milk contains enzymes that help protect against nec
3144194 babies born at one pound have their intestinal development in place but all things attributed to function are either at the earliest phase or have not kicked in at all breast milk has growth factors that affect the ability of the gut to grow and can get the digestion process on track to prevent this dangerous infection
3144195 every second counts for the growth rate of infants especially in the first days when babies are gaining up to 20 grams per kilogram of weight per day
3144196 the brain increases 5 in size every 48 to 72 hours adequate and extra nutrients can improve brain growth which is something the spin program is measuring
3144197 human milk provides benefits that are both nutritional and neurological
3144198 in our life time we will not be able to replicate its biological complexities until that day the best thing for all newborns is breast milk the spin program will help us learn how and why for preemies
3144199 while this was a very difficult decision we feel it was the right thing to do for the future of midway
3144200 we view every game as an investment that must meet certain standards for quality scheduling and profitability
3144201 allow midway to maximize its development resources and apply manpower and capital to projects with the highest chances of success

3144223 in the past six years new engineering enrollments at michigan universities have plummeted by more than 13 percent compared to a nine percent increase nationally
3144224 in michigan this precipitous drop is clearly linked to layoffs and poor performance within the domestic auto industry
3144225 forty five percent or more of all chinese college students currently study engineering compared to just 4 5 percent in the united states
3144226 nationally low enrollments at engineering schools are tied to poor high school preparation and low interest levels especially among women and minorities
3144227 more and better educated engineers are needed if our nation and its auto industry are to thrive or even survive
3144228 the problem of low engineering enrollments can only be solved by decisive action that includes changes in public policy and national programs as well as increased collaboration within the educational community government and the private sector
3144229 after our engineers and technological entrepreneurs are educated well need to gather them in adequate numbers to concentrate their technical and creative capabilities in order to form engines for innovation similar to what occurred several decades ago in californias silicon valley
3144230 weve seen this phenomenon occur more recently in bangalore india in helsinki finland in dublin ireland and in singapore we need to take similar initiatives here
3144231 the future of industries economies and nations rests squarely on the shoulders of technological innovators if we want a brighter future for our state and for our nation we need to collaborate on aggressive programs and public policy to attract educate and assemble those innovators
3144232 by working with johnson controls oak ridge national laboratory will achieve its long term energy reduction goals far earlier than expected while saving millions of taxpayer dollars
3144233 we are dedicated to alternative energy sources being able to tap renewable energy for our facility is a great way to see our purpose realized
3144234 one year ago secretary bodman challenged the entire u s department of energy to meet or exceed the presidents goals for increasing energy efficiency decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the use of renewable energy in the federal government
3144235 im proud to announce doe is delivering with alternative financing methods that reduce the need for federal spending
3144236 this project is a great example of what can happen when strong leadership combines with innovative solutions

3144252 the use of chili peppers as a spice has spread to nearly every culture within 20 degrees of the equator and it tends to decline as you move toward the poles
3144253 since congenitally blind individuals could not have learned pride and shame behaviors from watching others these displays of victory or defeat are likely to be an innate biological propensity in humans rather than learned behaviour
3144254 these findings support evolutionary accounts that pride and shame would have been powerful mechanisms in enhancing or inhibiting an individuals social status
3144255 a general message from amphibians is that we may have little time to stave off a potential mass extinction
3144256 an ancient organism which has survived past extinctions is telling us that something is wrong right now
3144257 we humans may be doing fine right now but they are doing poorly the question really is whether well listen before its too late
3144258 its important for people to understand whats infecting and killing these frogs
3144259 this disease is a remarkable example of a pathogen jumping boundaries and causing havoc if we can understand how it is able to do so we may be able to help the frogs as well as ourselves
3144260 people have always been fascinated by how some trees such as douglas fir or redwoods can grow so tall
3144261 this is not an easy thing to do think about trying to drink water through a narrow 350 foot long straw it takes a lot of suction
3144262 higher and higher in the tree the valves are able to withstand more pulling force from the long heavy column of water before air bubbles can be sucked through
3144263 but the problem is that the valves become less efficient at letting water pass the height at which no water would pass at all according to our models coincides the tallest records for douglas fir about 350 to 400 feet
3144264 as you go higher and higher in a douglas fir tree its almost like experiencing a drought
3144265 and thats what we see at the tops of very tall trees the foliage is struggling to get enough water and seems to be under drought stress its not unusual to see periodic die back at the tops of very tall douglas fir trees that are near their height limits
3144266 is that the founders of these disciplines envisioned the same thing that you have this broad dispersal of all of the organisms that each happened to be studying and that they would colonize the surface of the earth depending on whether the environment was suitable for them
3144267 before now all biologists could do was look at the biodiversity of microbes that could be cultured in a petri dish we now know that the vast majority of microbial life cannot be kept in captivity now we have the ability to grab dna from the environment and try to characterize different species or taxonomic groups using genetic material allowing our field to blast off
3144268 we are just beginning to scratch the surface of what these patterns look like
3144269 was that the diversity gradient more correlated with temperature than primary productivity
3144270 sackler colloquium in the light of evolution biodiversity and extinction
3144271 from our study we saw that environmental selection seemed to play a larger role and was more important for microbes than the plants
3144272 you have to be careful about the conclusions that you make
3144273 so on a 2 000 meter elevation gradient for example the spatial scale relative to the body size of a plant is much much larger when you consider what the universe looks like to a microbe
3144274 diversity patterns on mountainsides have been studied mostly on plants and animals for hundreds of years
3144275 yet microbes are the most diverse set of organisms on earth and they are really important for how ecosystems work our study establishes the first elevation gradient pattern for microbes we found that yes microbes do have a diversity pattern that is similar to what has been studied for plants and animals but the pattern is different than what you see for plants in the rockies and there is much to be done to understand why microbes might have a different biodiversity pattern
3144276 i dont think that microbes are fundamentally different from a biological standpoint from plants and animals i think that we havent figured out how to study them in an analogous way
3144277 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3144278 both the fungus and the birds eat chilies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
3144279 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3144280 having such a specific defense one that doesnt harm reproduction or dispersal is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant and i think it is a great example of the power of natural selection
3144281 by contrast peppers increase their chemical defense levels or their heat as they ripen this is a very different model and peppers can get away with it because birds dont sense pain when they eat capsaicin
3144282 i think a lot of plants would love to come up with this way of stopping fungal growth without inhibiting dispersers its just very hard to do
3144283 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3144284 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3144285 in the north any adaptive benefit to using eating chilies would be much smaller than at the equator because microbial infection of food is less common and its easier to keep food cold maybe thats why food in the north can be so boring
3144286 along the equator without access to refrigeration you could be dead pretty quickly unless you can find a way to protect yourself against the microbes you ingest every day
3144287 its very clear that eliminating this protein has cardiovascular benefits
3144288 rna based drugs might provide a course of treatment for people whose cholesterol levels are resistant to current drugs or they might be combined with current drugs
3144289 ever since charles darwins discovery of giant ground sloth remains in south america debate has ensued about the cause of early extinction of the worlds megafauna now 150 years on from the publication of darwins seminal work the origin of species the argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
3144290 island environments offer an excellent test of competing hypotheses they typically have a similar megafauna and climate to neighbouring continental landmasses but human arrival was often delayed
3144291 the tasmanian results echo those on mainland australia putting humans squarely back in the frame as the driving force behind megafaunal extinction
3144292 the skeletal remains provide key evidence of tasmanias final megafauna in the dim if not too distant past
3144293 plants are dying out at the bottom of their ranges and at the tops of their ranges they seem to be growing in and doing much better
3144294 the only thing that could explain this happening across the entire face of the mountain would be a change in the local climate
3144295 i was surprised by how nice the data looked and how unambiguous the signal was
3144296 it is clear that ecosystems can respond rather rapidly to climate change
3144297 the plants should still be in a recovery phase where they are growing back in
3144298 but they have stopped recovering and now are dying which these plants should not be doing
3144299 stabilizing the size of the human population and reducing its consumption
3144300 maintaining living hedges around agricultural plots and preserving remnant trees in pasture
3144301 fitting coincidence because homo sapiens is now behaving in ways reminiscent of a spoiled teenager
3144302 we know where biodiversity will go from here up in smoke toward the poles and under water into crops and livestock onto the table and into yet more human biomass into fuel tanks into furniture pet stores and home remedies for impotence out of the way of more cities and suburbs into distant memory and history books
3144303 the support system for civilization will be destroyed and the world as we now know it will disappear

3144328 i think one of the great challenges we and other builders and operators face today is obviously rising construction and material costs
3144329 a level that is more than two times larger than any time in our 80 year history
3144330 steel for pipe making has doubled since the beginning of the year
3144331 and the cost of large diameter pipe has increased approximately 60 for the most part weve minimized the impact of these increases by locking in our pipe at or near the time we committed to go forward with our customers under long term transportation contracts
3144332 the cost of pipe on some of our earlier projects where we ordered a pipe upfront was in the 1 200 per ton range today the same pipe is going for in the range of 2 500 per ton by locking in early we save enormous amounts of money

3144378 the federal government has got an onslaught of cyberattacks from foreign entities and it needs to do something pretty quickly
3144379 this whole tic initiative has caused civilian agencies who one could argue are not as security savvy as the intelligence community and the defense department to really button things up
3144380 internet access if its not managed properly can provide security risks
3144381 the government is looking for a way to consolidate that access to make it easier and more efficient to apply appropriate security the government will see the benefits of this immediately

3144410 otherwise i would have to slap him with my glove
3144411 pulling somebody who has sex all the time anyway wheres all the thrill of the chase
3144412 but then again having sex with someone whos had more traffic then the m25 could be an eye opener for some people
3144413 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3144414 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3144415 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3144416 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3144417 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3144418 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3144419 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3144420 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3144421 these latest upgrades are part of an ongoing effort to keep the lapd websites services ahead of the curve in the way we use technology to be transparent and communicate with the public

3144423 she was a puppy she was not housebroken and her owner got mad at having to clean up messes in the apartment and did this in a rage
3144424 all of us in the animal welfare community are very grateful to irving animal services the irving police and to the dallas county district attorneys office for their diligence in pursuing and prosecuting this case
3144425 they woke up this weekend and figured out that that ad resonated and they needed to do something about it
3144426 if the celebrity issue were not hurting them they would have ignored it
3144427 the popularity of the iphone along with the emergence of various applications and faster connectivity makes it an ideal platform for developing applications that incorporate quality real time voip giving consumers real world communication experiences like in game multi person chat

3144434 corrections officers can monitor exactly the whereabouts of an offender at any given moment these are very precise satellite driven devices
3144435 it makes the job of the correctional officer more efficient
3144436 the evidence is that they work unreliably that the technology is not proven and that there are dropout zones where the technology fails
3144437 its the electronic quick fix but so far there have not been a sufficient number of analyses to determine what benefits fall out from this technology
3144438 this type of gimmickry takes away from proven reliable human interventions that are actually evidence based
3144439 offenders are being held more accountable than ever to their court orders
3144440 there was a lot of shrapnel flying in the air there was pieces of propane tanks coming down out of the sky
3144441 thats what we were running away from when we first left the house
3144442 there was a lot of stuff flying out of the sky on fire
3144443 the problem with asbestos is when its disturbed and becomes airborne it becomes dangerous to people
3144444 we are unable to allow people in the vicinity of the 100 or so remaining homes until the ministry of the environment approves our plan for cleanup we hope to see results on that today
3144445 its an accident waiting to happen i just think there should be a lot more caution shown
3144446 ive got our kids at my house ive got a dog with no food
3144447 ive got to get clothes to go to work its just a mess
3144448 police did a really good job they took care of the plaza
3144449 im disappointed with the government that they would allow anything like a propane company to be situated where it is in the middle of a heavy residential area
3144450 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
3144451 there are a number of potential reasons why proton pump inhibitors might have this effect but we need to do further research to answer those questions
3144452 someone might have very mild heartburn that could easily be managed with other medications such as tums or zantac who are prescribed a proton pump inhibitor
3144453 and then it works but no one ever thinks of stepping down the therapy
3144454 and there are a lot of people we know who arent on these medications
3144455 however there are also people who get prescribed these medications and dont know why there is obviously appropriate use but there is inappropriate overuse and inappropriate underuse
3144456 im comfortable at this point with saying if youre only going to be on this medication a short time dont worry if youre going to be on it a long time the jurys still out as to what you should do
3144457 if youre on one of these medications and think you may be at risk for osteoporosis or you have osteoporosis or youve had a fracture in the past its a good time for you to make an appointment with your doctor to discuss why youre on these medications

3144462 master cpl doyle was killed while he was protecting his position and his fellow soldiers
3144463 these guys should all be required to report and should be keeping us notified where they are at all times full stop
3144464 we hear from them when they are stuck in the ice and they need some assistance
3144465 it takes a little while for the word to get out
3144466 you and me pick up the bill when the search and rescue goes bad
3144467 youve got these people up there that youre ultimately responsible for and youre saying you dont have to tell us that youre there its just an all around bad idea

3144482 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3144483 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3144484 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3144485 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3144486 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3144487 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3144488 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3144489 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3144513 estamos teniendo una reuni n de trabajo encabezada por el jefe de gabinete el ministro mario oporto y el ministro de econom a rafael perelmiter para definir los pasos a seguir
3144514 recuperar el poder adquisitivo perdido en lo que va del a o por el alza en el costo de vida
3144515 venimos demostrando un fuerte compromiso y respeto por la gran familia educativa de la provincia
3144516 para nosotros es un tema central como lo demuestra la gran participaci n de lo que es el presupuesto docente en el presupuesto de la provincia por eso los aumentos que dimos en su momento de m s del 24 esperemos que a trav s del di logo constructivo podamos ir solucionando y destrabando este conflicto
3144517 con preocupaci n con angustia no es lo que dese bamos
3144518 hemos hecho esfuerzos hasta ltimo momento inclusive ayer domingo instru al ministro oporto para que se comunique con los responsables gremiales para hacer el ltimo intento para no llegar a este paro y seguir conversando y consensuando una salida
3144519 quiero ser muy cuidadoso a lo que es el marco institucional que se prev para este tipo de situaciones cuando hay diferencias que son las paritarias
3144520 los maestros y profesores de toda la provincia est n manifestando su profundo descontento con la pol tica educativa del gobierno
3144521 el nivel de acatamiento es alto en algunos distritos es del cien por ciento pero en general no bajan de un 97 por ciento de adhesi n es un paro masivo
3144522 hablan en la postura m s dura de un 24 30 por ciento de inflaci n anual
3144523 en caso de que eso ocurriera se tratar a de un avasallamiento al derecho de los trabajadores que ser respondido de inmediato con una serie de medidas
3144524 hubo un gremio que no vio con buenos ojos la suba obtenida y ejerci presi n fue a ra z de ese inconveniente que se gener temor entre los trabajadores
3144525 hablamos hoy mismo con el director provincial de relaciones laborales del ministerio de trabajo dr h ctor daniel montes de oca qui n hizo referencia que el acuerdo ha sido ratificado s lo resta que se a homologado con la firma del ministro titular de la cartera
3144526 descartamos que la actitud del ministro va a ser positiva ya que el acuerdo fue hablado con l y decidido con su consentimiento
3144527 ser a de una situaci n in dita algo que ser a inaceptable por los compa eros que conforman el sector m s postergado de la administraci n p blica
3144528 para llevar tranquilidad a las bases no vamos a permitir que el logro se vea deslucido si algo hiciera peligrar la liquidaci n de ese aumento de cien pesos logrado se tratar a de un avasallamiento al derecho de los trabajadores que ser respondido de inmediato con una serie de medidas
3144529 el relevamiento posibilitar tener los datos oficiales y concretos sobre la cantidad de empleados que trabajan en las canteras que est n dentro de la poligonal y en esto tambi n tiene intervenci n el gremio del sector
3144530 prev concretamente la preservaci n de las fuentes laborales es por ello que se lleva adelante este censo para saber el n mero exacto de trabajadores
3144531 este es otro paso que se est dando junto al gobierno bonaerense en este proceso que venimos realizando para dar forma a la nueva legislaci n que proteger el paisaje serrano y que terminar con la explotaci n de las sierras

3144547 to be nominated is great to win and beat some hometown heroes that would be a true accomplishment
3144548 anything else but the truth focused more on me as a singer songwriter
3144549 you can hear it in the sparse production and acoustic guitar
3144550 adams drumming style introduced a more powerful rock sound and jons electric guitar added another level of atmosphere and texture
3144551 and their higher ranges allowed for an array of harmonies that really tied in that indie pop influence and brought the songs to life
3144552 i try to separate from myself as well and tell other peoples stories through the lyrics
3144553 about the romantic dynamic between two individuals when one person has more emotionally invested than the other
3144554 even if about two siblings who lose their father to mental illness
3144555 radiate is loosely based on my own family relocating from an urban area to the suburbs and the sacrifice that comes with raising children
3144556 robs guidance on the arrangements really helped shape the record into something more focused and concise
3144557 our intention with scream and light up the sky was to communicate pessimism and the darkest of emotions
3144558 but at the same time not take ourselves too seriously its heartfelt but expressed with a sarcastic tone
3144559 the new frontiers might surprise you with music thats sincere and wise beyond its years
3144560 the debut album by this texas quintet is a calm pleasure there is nothing extravagant in the simple piano and guitar led songs herein just understated but satisfying melodies wrapped up in a mature songcraft never resorting to melodrama or grandiosity the new frontiers have instead created an album that engages without gimmick or shtick just good songs
3144561 to all of those who are waiting for whiskeytown to get around to recording that long promised reunion album its probably not going to happen never fear no depression back issue collectors the new frontiers are here to prescribe your alt country paxil the dallas based crew led by singer nathan pettijohn produces a melodic sound that has as much grit under its boots as it does ambient atmospherics in its backdrop searing guitars soaring vocals and a winsome sense of melancholia in other words perfect for road trips and rainy days alike
3144562 overall i can say with a clear head that with mending the new frontiers have probably created one of the best albums i have heard in the last few years
3144563 if you like your indie rock more on the accessible side than the arty side than the new frontiers mending is one you should really pick up it stays grounded with a plethora of solid melody and stays on the edge of being epic without ever going overboard this is a band that does not depend on volume but uses every instrument to maximum effect i count myself lucky to have stumbled upon this one
3144564 with memorable songs and honest lyrics the new frontiers have given us an inspirational and unforgettable album with mending
3144565 its the wallflowers sans dylan marked with possible nods to the perishers this dallas tx quintet is actually quite impresive
3144566 if youre for looking an album for a nice relaxing evening at home then turn down the lights close your eyes and let the somber melodies drift into your dreams
3144567 the new frontiers have created one of the best albums of 2008
3144568 the truth of the matter is that the new frontiers is exactly what todays music scene needs more of
3144569 i guess were control freaks too but i think that handling everything ourselves has also freed us to be a lot more comfortable and loose in the studio and i really feel like that comes across in these new songs
3144570 its amazing how the problems they had back then transcend to our lives today
3144571 i think of the album as an open ended conversation
3144572 im going places that i dont necessarily like to think about but im doing it in the hopes that there are other people out there whove felt the same things and are also trying to deal with it
3144573 wow i havent worked this hard since last year last year in the middle of winter i had to shovel a whole driveway out took me like an hour and it was really cold they paid me twenty five dollars and a steak though
3144574 last year i was out in the forest logging i had a cup of soup to live on every day roughly 200 calories eight hours hard labor
3144575 wow but as long as youre making money its worth it
3144576 didnt make much money otherwise i would have had more to eat i remember one day i had to split cedar posts using a maul and wedges a wedge popped up and broke my knuckle at the end of the pinky finger the finger itself turned purple and swelled to the size of my thumb i wrapped it in duct tape and had to keep working to make ends meet
3144577 huh that reminds me of the time i stubbed my toe and the nail chipped off it hurt like hell i asked my mom to put a bandaid on it but she didnt and then it started bleeding and then she finally put a bandaid on it
3144578 yep used to have a truck but it caught fire and died
3144579 oh well my family used to have a truck too but my mom crashed it we only have three cars now
3144580 when im losing my control the city spins around youre the only one who knows you slow it down

3144586 obama is a natural born us citizen regardless of place of birth because his parents marriage was invalid the problem comes down to the validity of obamas parents marriage when he was 18 barack obama sr married a woman named kezia and had four children with her two of them later returned to kenya from the united states he never divorced her in the us polygamy is illegal if you are already married regardless of where you got married all subsequent marriages are invalid this is the case with the marriage of stanley ann dunham and barack obama sr in february 1961 barak obama jr was born out of wedlock as a child born out of wedlock a different citizenship law is applied

3144594 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3144595 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3144596 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3144597 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3144598 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3144599 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3144600 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3144601 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3144602 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3144603 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3144604 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3144605 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3144606 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3144607 what we find is that the same problems show up year after year and the same vehicles tend to show up year after year
3144608 when we report back to manufacturers that this vehicle has this particular problem 99 times out of 100 they recognize this vehicle has a problem and theyre aware of it

3144633 rabbi we know that you are a teacher who has come from god for no one can do these signs that you do apart from the presence of god
3144634 very truly i tell you no one can see the kingdom of god without being born from above
3144635 how can anyone be born after having grown old can one enter a second time into the mothers womb and be born
3144636 very truly i tell you no one can enter the kingdom of god without being born of water and spirit what is born of the flesh is flesh and what is born of the spirit is spirit do not be astonished that i said to you you must be born from above the wind blows where it chooses and you hear the sound of it but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes so it is with everyone who is born of the spirit
3144637 are you a teacher of israel and yet you do not understand these things
3144638 for god so loved the world that he gave his only son so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life
3144639 indeed god did not send the son into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through him those who believe in him are not condemned but those who do not believe are condemned already because they have not believed in the name of the only son of god and this is the judgment that the light has come into the world and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for all who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light so that their deeds may not be exposed but those who do what is true come to the light so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in god

3144653 a depressingly consistent aspect of american foreign policy since the korean war has been to let down peoples who fight for us trust us or depend on us remember the montagnards of vietnam who fought so valiantly with our green berets during the indochina conflict most of them ended up dead or in reeducation camps and it was decades before the survivors were even given visas to come to the usa
3144654 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position it has been a rough few weeks for mccain on the foreign policy front paging dr maliki but he appears to have been ahead of the curve in his assessment that moscow was the bad actor here
3144655 mccain though went with his instinct and with a sense of moral clarity that seems to have been borne out by russias widening campaign
3144656 apparently someone looked it up and told obama whose side we are on
3144657 so now mccain is trying to claim that he foresaw what russia is currently doing in georgia when the only reason mccain
3144658 georgia and ukraine have expressed their desire for a nato membership action plan we should offer it to them at the summit
3144659 whether ukraine and georgia ultimately join nato will be a decision for the members of the alliance and the citizens of those countries after a period of open and democratic debate but they should receive our help and encouragement as they continue to develop ties to atlantic and european institutions
3144660 its a pretty safe bet that georgia and abkhazia will not resolve their conflict on their own
3144661 these are not two different things because its not amputating hand its amputating head or heart no georgian president could survive if he gave up on abkhazia
3144662 if the international community by its inaction will not leave any other option for georgia then we have to make decision
3144663 if john mccain wants to make this election turn on his russia policy thats a debate obama should welcome
3144664 natos decision to withhold a membership action plan for georgia might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia and i urge the nato allies to revisit the decision
3144665 concerns about what occurs there might seem distant and unrelated to the many other interests america has around the world and yet russian aggression against georgia is both a matter of urgent
3144666 georgia is an ancient country at the crossroads of eastern europe and central asia and one of the worlds first nations to adopt christianity as an official religion

3144670 overall the results for the quarter were solid and the operating margins in our core books of business have proven to be resilient in this soft market cycle however the general economic and insurance market conditions have provided ongoing challenges nonetheless we continue to maintain discipline in our underwriting and pricing practices we see little or no long term benefit to chasing underpriced business for the sake of near term top line growth our strategy of increasing our retention of the business produced within the commercial specialty area has helped to bolster revenue and partially offset the soft market conditions we also believe that our continued selective expansion into new states will yield long term benefits by positioning us to attract new business within the broader footprint when market pricing returns to more rational levels
3144671 our net combined ratio of 90 annualized return on average equity of 15 and cash flow from operations of over 17 million for the second quarter demonstrate the results of our underwriting discipline and focus on the bottom line solid investment performance has also contributed to a 16 increase in book value per share since the end of the second quarter of 2007 our long term focus is to continue to improve the financial value and operational capacity of the company as measured through intrinsic value per share while this will not necessarily occur evenly over discrete quarterly intervals we are nonetheless pleased with the continued progress made during the second quarter of 2008
3144672 our second quarter results continue to reflect solid operational performance strong revenue growth was driven by significant increases in sales of both biopsy disposables and biopsy capital equipment compared with the second quarter a year ago also contributing to growth in revenue for the quarter was a commercial level of product promotion activity for contura mlb which was in pre launch human clinical evaluation a year ago despite the significant impact of the litigation costs incurred during the period we remain encouraged by our operating performance and our outlook for the future the market for our breast care products continues to expand including growth related to our ongoing international expansion through distributors in more than 15 countries
3144673 which showed solid improvement compared to the second quarter last year the increase primarily reflects improved efficiencies in the production of our disposable biopsy probes and tissue markers along with incremental gross margin contribution from sales of contura mlb in addition gross margin continues to benefit from improved leverage of our manufacturing overhead across increased sales volume and inventory unit production
3144674 we remain focused on executing our strategy to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities for senorx in the expanding market for interventional diagnostic and therapeutic products in breast care

3144697 it was inventive on his part ill give him that
3144698 we told the georgians that their desire to join nato will not help solve the problems of abkhazia and south ossetia it will lead to renewed bloodshed
3144699 russia has practically ceased to recognize georgias territorial integrity and internationally recognized borders and is using force to underscore this fact international organizations are as usual behind the curve in taking note of this development and drawing the conclusions from it
3144700 moscow is very interested in stopping georgia developing as a pro west state and blocking its bid to join nato the west must be equally determined to help tbilisi follow its chosen course
3144701 heavily armed proxy troops opened fire on georgian villages while the secessionist authorities refused to talk with tbilisi
3144702 the attacking forces began destroying the transmission antennae of georgian mobile telephone systems arms and paramilitary groups poured in from russia to south ossetia through the russian controlled roki tunnel russian officials in georgia claimed that the attacking forces were out of russias control officials in moscow meanwhile justified the attacks directly and indirectly by accusing georgia of aggression

3144705 the divestiture provisions of house bill 1516 conflict with article 36 a part i of the new hampshire constitution because it would require the board to make investment decisions for the purpose other than providing benefits to members and beneficiaries and divest assets in order to further the foreign policy objectives of the new hampshire legislature
3144706 shall not be encumbered for or diverted to any other purposes
3144707 my concern is that the legislature is stepping into the shoes of the trustees without the attendant fiduciary duties of the trustees
3144708 you dont want the legislature on a whim to do these kinds of things without a benchmark for how serious the thing is
3144709 but in real life theres acting and theres not acting we have real dollars blood money more or less going to the benefit of the public employees of the state
3144710 the ongoing atrocities in the darfur region of the sudan are disturbing and warrant the restrictions on sudan linked investments i encourage the state and the judicial retirement systems to make responsible efforts to comply with new hampshires divestment law i believe strongly it is the right thing and the moral thing to do and can be done without compromising the sound investment strategies adopted by the boards
3144711 i cant imagine the sudan investments are so far superior to anything else out there in the marketplace just like i cant imagine theyd invest in illegal drug sales which obviously would turn a huge profit
3144712 theres no law in the new hampshire constitution or new hampshire code that says you cannot replace poorly performing investments with financially superior alternatives that are not tied up in one of the worst human rights abuses of our time

3144715 plants are dying out at the bottom of their ranges and at the tops of their ranges they seem to be growing in and doing much better
3144716 the only thing that could explain this happening across the entire face of the mountain would be a change in the local climate
3144717 i was surprised by how nice the data looked and how unambiguous the signal was
3144718 it is clear that ecosystems can respond rather rapidly to climate change
3144719 the plants should still be in a recovery phase where they are growing back in
3144720 but they have stopped recovering and now are dying which these plants should not be doing

3144759 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3144760 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3144761 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3144762 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3144763 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3144764 el poder de un s lo deseo puede cambiar tu vida
3144765 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3144766 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3144767 i know i have to be careful when i talk to a journalist but i can say this it wasnt the fuck fest it is now
3144768 a lot of the times in the last olympics it wasnt possible to pull back two seconds on the final length when the guy i was racing was so far ahead
3144769 when i saw the last 50 meters and i saw he bernard was far ahead i thought no way
3144770 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for
3144771 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
3144772 running down somebody who holds the world record and is on their game is incredible
3144773 ive been a part of the two teams at the last two olympics that came out behind i think i wanted it more than anybody not just for myself but to show that we are the nation to beat in that relay
3144774 to be honest with you i got really tired of losing i finished real strong
3144775 i was pretty pleased there were no cameras on me when jason touched the wall because i jumped so high i almost fell in the pool
3144776 we believed in the gold medal until the end we lost by a few hundredths of a second but life doesnt stop there
3144777 that touch made the difference experience prevailed over talent today and i regret that
3144778 we knew what we were capable of but i am still in disbelief that we did what we did
3144779 all of us stuck to our jobs as a unit the french are an amazing squad and its incredible we beat them
3144780 if everything goes well i think in a couple days
3144781 i feel like ive been making good progress every day taking a good step forward each time

3144791 the victim did have visible injuries and we also believe alcohol was involved that will be part of the investigation but the victim also declined medical treatment

3144793 at this time there are no plans for tori to appear in the 90210 spin off

3144795 we were 40 hours into this and now the doctors are getting concerned about the water being broken and the possibility of infection
3144796 i wouldnt say shes alves suffering but shes having to dig deep shes tired shes exhausted shes in pain when the contractions come youve gotta push and in between them those 30 second intervals shes passing out and then coming back to and that went on for hours
3144797 and we had this problem upon contractions the babys pulse would sink it was getting down to 70 which means the umbilical cord is somewhere strapped across the oesophagus
3144798 the doctor called c section and as soon as they say c section 33 minutes later the babys out i was like 60 hours weve been in here and if wed have come in and just said lets just have it you could do it in three hours

3144806 but theres an overall view in the market right now that demand is really cratering

3144815 the russians say that your troops have killed some 2 000 people in ossetia do you have any estimate about how many people have been killed and injured
3144816 well lets put it this way the town of tskhinvali by the moment when georgian troops entered it didnt even have that much number of people its a very very small town and prior to the fighting anticipating the fighting local russian authorities evacuated most of the population and we didnt anticipate fighting apparently they did and we only responded when after many hours of artillery barrage after a unilateral ceasefire declared by us that killed lots of people by the way because we wouldnt respond on our side then when i heard around 11 30 11 50 p m that 150 russian tanks are entering our sovereign territory from this place there is a very mountain you know long mountainous tunnel called the rocky tunnel into the georgian territory our forces were stationed somewhere here so when they got entered the only way we could get them was to respond with artillery fire to stop mass land invasion of the sort that happened to afghanistan and czechoslovakia in 1968
3144817 georgian president mikheil saakashvili seems to care less about these people than about asserting that they live in georgian territory

3144834 ik las laatst dat de rivier de eem de enige rivier is die in nederland ontspringt n uitmondt ik begreep dat sommige amersfoorters de stad daarmee een hogere toeristische status toedichten
3144835 mensen willen zichzelf interessanter en belangrijker voordoen dan ze zijn neem nou de gemeentelijke voorlichting vroeger waren dat gewoon voorlichters of vooruit persvoorlichters maar dat was te gewoontjes daarom werden het communicatie medewerkers en tegenwoordig zijn het media adviseurs van de afdeling strategie en communicatie concernstaf gemeente amersfoort
3144836 en je moet toegeven dat het waanzinnig interessant klinkt het is trouwens net zoiets als de werkster die interieurverzorgster is geworden dat klinkt ook heel strategisch
3144837 een ander voorbeeld is de poeha rond amersfoort groenste stad van nederland dat was al kul maar het werd helemaal belachelijk toen we de groenste stad van europa werden ach ja ik vind het ook wel iets vertederends hebben hoor die dikdoenerij net zo als jongetjes die tegenover elkaar staan op te scheppen over hun vaders auto
3144838 omroep amersfoort die maken nog opnamen met oude cameras die een 4 staat tot 3 verhouding hebben maar ze hebben het uitzenden ingesteld op breedbeeldtelevisie dat geeft een lachspiegeleffect alles wordt breder weergegeven dan in werkelijkheid

3144840 de kennismaking was niet altijd even onschuldig de schrikreactie kwam zowel van de vogel als van mij en dat terwijl ik al mijn concentratie nodig had om niet mijn benen te breken over de keien eenmaal kwam ik dus wel onzacht in aanraking met de natte zwarte ondergrond

3144843 zijn hardlooppogingen heeft hij allang opgegeven zijn marathondromen leiden een vegeterend bestaan ik zwaai naar hem en keer mijn hoofd om zodat ik langzaam de concentratie kan opbouwen die nu nog week is en makkelijk kan loslaten maar hard en ondoordringbaar moet worden zodat ze me aan het einde van de marathon kan beschermen tegen de pijn die ik zal voelen
3144844 niemand begrijpt waarom ik hardloop en eerlijk gezegd zelf begrijp ik het ook nauwelijks of in ieder geval maar bij vlagen zon plotseling inzicht verschilt bovendien altijd weer van het vorige splijtende inzicht over de fundamentele redenen waarom ik ren maar ik hoef het ook niet te begrijpen en dat ik het niet hoef te begrijpen houdt me gaande
3144845 het gaat me in mijn hoofd makkelijk af maar onderweg voel ik dat mijn lichaam ook niet echt begrijpt waarom ik zoveel vrije tijd in dat stomme voortsjokken steek

3144975 one of our bedrock privacy principles is transparency by which we mean that we are upfront with our users about what information we collect and how we use it so that they can make informed choices about their personal information
3144976 ensuring that we earn and keep our users trust is an essential constant for building the best possible products

3144980 we also believe that a strong and easy to find mechanism to permit consumers to opt out of this type of data collection is a goal that all companies should aspire to achieve
3144981 opt out mechanisms for online advertising are often buried in fine print difficult to understand hard to execute and technically inadequate
3144982 moreover in most cases opt out mechanisms offered for behavioral advertising only opt a user out of receiving targeted ads but do not opt the user out of data collection about his or her internet usage
3144983 individual web sites and search engines and their affiliates that monitor users also owe consumers constructive notice of such activities and the right to limit or thwart any personal data collection

3144993 the design of the cifs remain premised on an aid framework for climate change financing which places the parties to the financing in a donor donee relationship contrary to international climate change principles and obligations

3145013 moderate alcohol may be considered part of a healthy lifestyle for overall chronic disease prevention including stroke when consumed responsibly and not contraindicated by other factors
3145014 the association between obesity and risk of chronic disease is complicated and can be obscured by a reduction in body weight as a result of preclinical or chronic disease
3145015 greater benefit is likely to be gained by adherence to healthy lifestyle choices in populations with a less healthy lifestyle than in these populations of health professionals
3145016 let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past that is why the united states and the international community must speak out strongly against this aggression and for peace and security
3145017 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attack withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world world history is often made in remote obscure countries it is being made in georgia today it is the responsibility of the leading nations of the world to ensure that history continues to be a record of humanitys progress toward respecting the values and security of free people

3145030 we can play a lot of different combinations that will force teams to make adjustments
3145031 after we lost in 04 everyone has pride and took that to the heart
3145032 we want to show that our game is still the best were the founders of this game
3145033 we feel that family chemistry other countries have over the last few years
3145034 but the bottom line is we cant talk about being the best weve got to show it
3145035 we had to make changes in the past weve spent two to three weeks getting ready for the games this time weve spent three years
3145036 i cant even imagine what former olympic coaches chuck daly and larry brown had to go through years ago i wouldnt say we havent taken it seriously but in the past we have been able to do that and win but other countries are better now

3145041 underscore this eleventh hour bid to save the nations greatest river
3145042 it sent a very clear message by saying weve had a lot of talk about the river system a lot of science we all know what the problem is we just want politicians to have the will to fix it up
3145043 they need to secure water upstream and send it down
3145044 they woke up this weekend and figured out that that ad resonated and they needed to do something about it
3145045 if the celebrity issue were not hurting them they would have ignored it
3145046 ever since charles darwins discovery of giant ground sloth remains in south america debate has ensued about the cause of early extinction of the worlds megafauna now 150 years on from the publication of darwins seminal work the origin of species the argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
3145047 island environments offer an excellent test of competing hypotheses they typically have a similar megafauna and climate to neighbouring continental landmasses but human arrival was often delayed
3145048 the tasmanian results echo those on mainland australia putting humans squarely back in the frame as the driving force behind megafaunal extinction
3145049 the skeletal remains provide key evidence of tasmanias final megafauna in the dim if not too distant past
3145050 thousands of animal and plant species from other countries have slipped into the united states posing serious threats to agriculture human health and the integrity of our lands and waters
3145051 they cheered so hard that every now and then we had to check the score

3145060 nbc has a lot at stake both in terms of the event and a promotional platform for a new television season
3145061 i would think if i were nbc right now id be very pleased its still early but judging off these ratings theyre in very good shape
3145062 they have a lot of big commitments to huge advertisers what else were they going to do
3145063 i dont think there is a corporate halo that carries over because i liked the olympics on nbc i will watch nbc programming i dont think it works that way
3145064 but when they run the promotions on the fall lineup nbc will obviously have the competitive edge against the other networks
3145065 while plaintiffs maintain that some members of the alleged class bought from boa in private placements they concede that none of the named plaintiffs themselves did so
3145066 it would be unfair to consumers with accounts at other firms as well as to the firms that settled if our investigation were to slow down or stop
3145067 we are meeting with regulators in missouri and look forward to the discussions
3145068 we are cooperating with all regulatory inquiries we have received

3145073 caffeine stimulates your nervous system signaling the body to release a small amount of energy from its fat stores
3145074 but stirring in milk cream or sugar can cause your insulin levels to rise which diminishes that metabolic effect

3145078 yahoo announced friday that consumers will be able to opt out of customized advertising on yahoo com
3145079 yahoo strongly believes that consumers want choice when customizing their online experience and they have also demonstrated a strong preference for advertising that is more personally relevant to them
3145080 bloggers or families who want to occasionally post content are generally subsidized by the advertising business model through free or reduced cost hosting and also through the ability to have text graphical and even video ads appear on the site
3145081 this ability to make money while sharing views increases the number of viewpoints that can be taken in public debates and surely enriches our public conversation as a nation and as a global society
3145082 den spieler auch nur eine sekunde l nger dort zu lassen
3145083 claims that we can make superior snap decisions by trusting intuition or through the power of unconscious thought have received a great deal of attention in the media
3145084 trust your gut instinct when those shopping decisions get tough say scientists
3145085 at worst theyre outright dangerous in stark contrast to claims made by the dutch research team and in the media we found very little evidence of the superiority of unconscious thought for complex decisions
3145086 on the contrary our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is if conscious thinkers are given adequate time to encode material or are allowed to consult material while they deliberate their choices are at least as good as those made unconsciously
3145087 the composition and dynamics of north atlantic communities will change
3145088 but whether that will help or harm local fisheries is an open question humans may have to adapt as well
3145089 the interesting thing to me is that the fossil record has something to say about the consequences of global warming
3145090 weve been encouraging black men to get screened at age 40 or 45 for more than a decade yet only one third of these high risk men reported being tested
3145091 our findings provide an important baseline assessment of psa test use among young men as physicians debate whether to expand use of the psa test in young men with risk stratification strategies
3145092 even a subtle increase in the psa value at that age is a pretty powerful predictor of future prostate disease and cancer
3145093 right now only one in five men are getting a psa test which is encouraging but i wish the number was higher this research suggests we can do a better job of screening men at age 40 and a better job in high risk men theres a huge population of african american men who are not getting screened and men with a family history of prostate cancer who are under 50 are also not getting screened
3145094 sophisticated optical devices that are mechanically robust yet fully biodegradable biocompatible and implantable dont exist today
3145095 such systems would greatly expand the use of current optical technologies in areas like human and livestock health environmental monitoring and food quality
3145096 for example at a low cost we could potentially put a bioactive silk film in every bag of spinach and it could give the consumer a readout of whether or not e coli bacteria were in the bag before the food was consumed
3145097 silks spun by spiders and silkworms represent the strongest and toughest natural fibers known they offer many opportunities for functionalization processing and biological integration when compared to conventional polymers
3145098 we have optical devices embedded with enzymes that are still active after almost a year of storage at room temperature this is amazing given that the same enzyme becomes inactive if forgotten and left unrefrigerated for a few days

3145103 while coleman natural beef is a relatively small supplier for whole foods market we are extremely disappointed that we must now question colemans assurances
3145104 i approached him and asked what he was doing out so late he told me in a very matter of fact way that his family were at home asleep and he was going to the shop
3145105 hes very adventurous but its a complete surprise he would do something like this i didnt hear a thing when he left and its terrifying to think what might have happened because he must have crossed several roads
3145106 watching spaced is kinda like watching a kevin smith film if kevin smith had any real talent
3145107 is only running ahead of bushs 2004 result in four states
3145108 is doing at least 2 46 percentage points better than kerry in 41 states in 2004 2 46 was bushs margin of victory in the national popular vote
3145109 every single one of obamas 12 strongest states when compared to kerry has an african american population that is below the national average of 12 4 this group includes four states montana idaho south dakota and wyoming that have the four lowest black populations in the country

3145111 its certainly possible that andrew knew about the possibility of the affair but i dont think andrew has been involved with the edwards campaign since it launched id guess andrews face time with his dad concerned rocketboom business not rielle hunter
3145112 this has come as a surprise and i am disappointed carlos cuellar has been a great player for the football club and inevitably there has been speculation about him playing in the premiership
3145113 the club has received a substantial uplift in fee and we will now reinvest in the team

3145117 clinically important refractive error affects half of the u s population 20 years or older
3145118 our estimated prevalence of myopia was higher than the 25 percent reported in previous u s studies and similar in persons under 40 years to that of ethnic chinese persons in singapore
3145119 the direct annual cost of refractive correction for distance visual impairment is estimated to be between 3 8 and 7 2 billion for persons 12 years and older

3145123 the possibility of having a great initiative dedicated to the islamic world would certainly have vast interest even though i dont think you could in any way compare it to the meeting of dissidents of the communist bloc in 1977
3145124 i imagine that it would speak about dissent with regard to the regimes of many countries that have an islamic majority not dissent towards islam as a religion
3145125 in these there was in many cases a democratic opposition capable in a certain sense to create a turning point in the entire country in the islamic world on the contrary the opposition is often more totalitarian and anti democratic than the regimes they want to change i am referring particularly to the fundamentalist movement of the muslim brotherhood
3145126 i believe that this initiative would benefit if it made people from the arab islamic world participate rather than those who are hostile towards islam
3145127 it would be interesting to invite muslim intellectuals but also non muslims from arab countries to debate the cancer that is destroying the arab islamic world
3145128 i believe that the real problem in our countries is the absence of debate

3145139 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3145140 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3145141 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3145142 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3145143 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3145144 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3145145 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3145146 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales

3145148 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3145149 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3145150 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3145151 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3145152 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3145153 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3145154 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3145155 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3145156 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3145157 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3145158 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche

3145160 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos

3145180 the current standard of care for hypercholesterolemia is adequate for many patients yet falls short in others who are unable to reach target ldl cholesterol targets with currently available therapies
3145181 although only recently described pcsk9 represents one of the best validated targets for the reduction of ldl cholesterol
3145182 the results presented here validate pcsk9 lowering by rnai as a therapeutic approach with high potential for acutely reducing ldl cholesterol and pave the way for the development of novel pcsk9 lowering agents for use in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia

3145186 some of you blmay have read some rumors about our next booster pack
3145187 i can neither confirm nor deny anything at least for right now
3145188 the democratic party is not my constituency these are people that believe in socialism i dont
3145189 but the problem is that when its come time to vote in the senate hes been a much better friend of george bush
3145190 we endorse politicians who support the things we believe in good paying jobs decent health care and retirement quality public services and improving the lives of working families
3145191 jim himes has committed to make these issues his priorities as the 4th districts representative in congress
3145192 we will not be outworked were moving full steam ahead
3145193 im not betting my house on it but i believe its extremely doable
3145194 if you ask me which tournament we could have chosen to win id have chosen the fp final at lords for sure
3145195 twenty20 is short sharp exciting but for us a lords final is the ultimate and has been for the last 30 years fifty overs gives a more accurate reflection of the sides in twenty20 one good or bad over can win the game in the extended period of 50 overs the better players will show out
3145196 and he says that despite the world cups and ashes series he still thinks a lords final will be a highlight of his career
3145197 he felt the captaincy was affecting his personal performance and that this was impacting on the team
3145198 its a brave decision and deserves respect for putting the team ahead of his personal ambition
3145199 i have a friend i like like that and i don

3145231 the majority of people to get their rights restored are democrats and if we get them registered we might overtake the state
3145232 could certainly swing an election but there are millions and millions of voters
3145233 theres also the perception for some reason that they are all black and all democrats and thats certainly not the case
3145234 it kind of offended my notion of justice you can serve your time and still have your rights taken away
3145235 i studied the history of black disenfranchisement in the state we had the grandfather laws and the tissue paper ballots when a black man came to vote they gave him a tissue paper ballot that was later thrown out there were lynchings and riots weve got a long history of depriving people of the right to vote in florida
3145236 this has been a major major thing in my heart
3145237 the information is not filtering to the people who need it

3145280 we know people are probably expecting a cheese fest and thats just not what we do
3145281 the truth is jeff and i write how we write
3145282 everythings got to come out of real emotion we want to deal with issues and show consequences but not the issue of the week and pound you over the head
3145283 earlier in the summer we anticipated that she was going to appear in the show but those plans were postponed for personal reasons on ms spellings behalf
3145284 as long as it doesnt hit you over the head
3145285 i think its important to show what kids really use
3145286 things can take a turn and you can get a big head or get jaded
3145287 the next two weeks were going to be unveiling more and more ads and everybody that we talk to is saying get ready get ready
3145288 it would be fairly straightforward to create that shot it wouldnt be that difficult
3145289 if somebody came to us and said we need to create this scene for a movie id say sure we can do that from creating it to making sure that it was seamless enough that you couldnt tell it was faked sure
3145290 whether anybody really caught this and thought oh you mean this is on tape or on film i dont know if anybody made that connection they didnt beat people over the head with the information or go out of their way to say what you are seeing is fake that tells me they had an idea what was going on and probably thought no big deal one way or the other
3145291 i dont think anybody is going to chastize them there are worse things than that and it doesnt seem to be hurting them so far

3145334 tolls and fares continue to be the last resort as we think about what we need to do to keep the turnpike and the t in good financial condition
3145335 i think that the public is clearer about the problems we face with the way in which we are structured and i think that the transportation issues and the conditions of our infrastructure is more apparent to people
3145336 the general manager looks forward to a robust discussion of cost saving concepts and areas for potential efficiencies
3145337 under no circumstances can you justify shooting at a shadow of a target with children in the area and firing on fully automatic at shadows and you havent determined your target nobody in the white or black community is willing to tolerate that kind of invasion
3145338 there needs to be true accountability of law enforcement that this kind of policy wont be tolerated and justice at every level in our community needs to prevail
3145339 from that selection of the jury pool you could have had an impartial jury a co racial jury
3145340 we heard his testimony and we were outraged that any law enforcement officer could shoot at shadows in a house where they knew there were children
3145341 all this will start after the first grading period therefore they will get the help they need the second the third and most of the fourth grading period so hopefully we wont need credit recovery at the end of the school year
3145342 it is key for them to learn that information to get that self knowledge of where we are as compared to where we were as a people 200 years ago

3145350 to completely whitewash us out of existence is hurtful discriminatory and shameful
3145351 its like the federal government is trying to say that we dont exist
3145352 their job on the census is not to count only those things that they wish existed and then refuse to count the rest how can you make public policy when you dont have accurate information
3145353 if we dont have an inaccurate census how can we sensibly provide federal state and local resources the census should be above political influence
3145354 it really should be what you say you are not what i perceive you to be
3145355 we have some limitations this particular act limits us in regards to this issue
3145356 this is simple discrimination plain and simple if the census bureau said they werent going to count black couples or mexican couples it would be thrown out immediately and people would be brought to court
3145357 fully repeal the defense of marriage act and enact legislation that would ensure that the 1 100 federal legal rights and benefits currently provided on the basis of marital status are extended to same sex couples
3145358 voted for the defense of marriage act which clearly indicated the unique status of a marriage between man and woman i will continue to support that i will continue to have my position
3145359 in contrast to earlier times our state now recognizes that an individuals capacity to establish a loving and long term committed relationship with another person and responsibly to care for and raise children does not depend upon the individuals sexual orientation and more generally that an individuals sexual orientation like a persons race or gender does not constitute a legitimate basis upon which to deny or withhold legal rights

3145380 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3145381 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3145382 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3145383 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3145384 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3145385 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3145386 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3145387 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3145388 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3145389 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3145390 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3145391 there is some fine tuning to be done such as paving and hot top
3145392 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3145393 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3145394 one of the main reasons we originally moved into the x86 processor business was because we believed that ultimately the third party chipset market would disappear and we would need to have the capability to provide a complete platform
3145395 at this time there are no plans for tori to appear in the 90210 spinoff

3145400 if i were the companies i would be issuing public disclosures five nanoseconds after the indictments were announced
3145401 if not there could be big checks the companies will have to be writing
3145402 telling the public that theyve been breached is embarrassing for them it makes them suffer a loss of goodwill and in the case of public companies the stock price goes down
3145403 we believe the credit card information was coming out of an officemax in north carolina
3145404 ongoing federal investigation involving legitimate debit card use at various retailers that was later tied to fraudulent transactions outside the u s
3145405 we have no knowledge of a security breach at officemax
3145406 it would be inappropriate to express our views relating to an ongoing criminal investigation
3145407 for the purpose of downloading credit card information of customers of forever 21
3145408 because we couldnt find any definite information that wed been breached
3145409 because there is no way for us to identify customers who might have been affected
3145410 the consumer always does have an opportunity to report fraudulent activities
3145411 had not received inquiries from credit card companies or customers about these alleged activities
3145412 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3145413 built on the philosophy that health care is a right and a responsibility
3145414 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3145415 both the fungus and the birds eat chilies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
3145416 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3145417 having such a specific defense one that doesnt harm reproduction or dispersal is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant and i think it is a great example of the power of natural selection
3145418 by contrast peppers increase their chemical defense levels or their heat as they ripen this is a very different model and peppers can get away with it because birds dont sense pain when they eat capsaicin
3145419 i think a lot of plants would love to come up with this way of stopping fungal growth without inhibiting dispersers its just very hard to do
3145420 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3145421 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3145422 in the north any adaptive benefit to using eating chilies would be much smaller than at the equator because microbial infection of food is less common and its easier to keep food cold maybe thats why food in the north can be so boring
3145423 if brain damage related to alzheimers disease begins earlier in adult life then having less reserve due to a smaller brain could compromise intellectual ability in those destined to get alzheimers and lead to them getting less education
3145424 although it has been known for many years that individuals with lower education have a greater risk of getting alzheimers this is the first report showing that reduced educational attainment may actually be an early sign of the underlying disease
3145425 lubna what youll do if you step on sharp nail
3145426 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3145427 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3145428 plants are dying out at the bottom of their ranges and at the tops of their ranges they seem to be growing in and doing much better
3145429 the only thing that could explain this happening across the entire face of the mountain would be a change in the local climate
3145430 i was surprised by how nice the data looked and how unambiguous the signal was
3145431 it is clear that ecosystems can respond rather rapidly to climate change
3145432 the plants should still be in a recovery phase where they are growing back in
3145433 but they have stopped recovering and now are dying which these plants should not be doing

3145436 it means that well likely see vegetation shift a lot faster than we might think
3145437 the plant death was striking and occurred in most species
3145438 the occurrence of plant death was obvious to everyone living in that area
3145439 drought certainly stands out as a real likely explanation it is an extremely severe event
3145440 my read was that the westerners felt shame in those situations but they were inhibiting those responses and i think that is supported by the blind findings
3145441 in american and other western cultures were taught from a very early age not to show shame its stigmatized whereas in the east its appropriate to show shame in a major olympic failure for instance
3145442 with pride the original function may have been actually if i make myself larger that tells others im someone to watch out for
3145443 over the course of evolution humans would acquire the innate propensity to associate this display with success
3145444 there are many times where its not that adaptive to show shame essentially youre saying i just screwed up
3145445 but if you really feel yourself weaker than an adversary and you could convey that that you agree youre more powerful than me i submit to you dont hurt me and we both save resources compared to if we had to fight my guess is thats why its still around
3145446 here are people who have never seen people express this
3145447 the only possible explanation you could make is well maybe their parents physically move their bodies in this way to teach them given the specificity of the response were not just talking about a simple arm stretch but chest expansion and shoulders pulling back and everything to me that seems like a less parsimonious suggestion than it being innate
3145448 primatologists have found that chimps show an inflated display when the alpha chimp is about to fight he puffs his shoulders and walks in a cocky gate
3145449 submission displays have been documented that involve cowering lowering of the body thats pretty similar to hunching the shoulders and the shame display but theres a difference between these anecdotal observations and an empirical study no ones coded a bunch of chimps and seen what are the exact behaviors you see in these situations
3145450 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3145451 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3145452 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3145453 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3145454 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
3145455 mr suskind reports that the bush administration in its pursuit of war created and promoted forged documents about iraq
3145456 i am particularly troubled that the decision to disseminate this fabricated intelligence is alleged to have come from the highest reaches of the administration the administrations attempt to challenge mr suskinds reporting appears to have been effectively dismissed by the publication of the authors interview recordings and transcripts i have instructed my staff to conduct a careful review of mr suskinds allegations and the role played by senior administration officials in this matter
3145457 im not sure i mean there are people i trust but im not sure to what extent

3145459 oh my god this is the first time ive ever heard you laugh can you giggle again
3145460 can you giggle more often you bore me to tears otherwise even when you are being funny
3145461 and sometimes they just sit back in awe and dont say a word
3145462 your eyes betray you they tell me when you are joking

3145473 i think peoples expectations got too high because they began to believe that these prices couldnt drop and almost the beginning of bubble mentality had taken place over the last year or so
3145474 no one knows how far prices will drop but the fact the world economy is slowing is finally getting recognized in the marketplace
3145475 however housing activity is definitely on a downward trend consistent with indications of deteriorating affordability through last year this factor is expected to keep new residential construction activity under pressure going forward our forecast assumes that starts will drop on average 5 3 per cent this year and 14 8 per cent next year
3145476 the challenging economic environment continues however we are pleased with our disciplined approach to margin expense and capital management
3145477 it would be very synergistic if it were doable however we dont see that the regulatory environment has changed since the last time we made comments on the subject
3145478 we think it would be problematic to try and merge the two companies in the current regulatory environment
3145479 fuel and transportation costs keep increasing to the point that we can no longer endorse further activity in westlock we wish to extend our sincerest appreciation to all employees for their loyalty and their many contributions made to lehmans success over the years we wish them all the best in the future
3145480 while we have experienced 26 per cent revenue growth over last year our profitability is down this action is expected to increase our profitability for the benefit of all shareholders
3145481 the harder thing will be looking at existing collections which is a big job
3145482 boeing will need to do everything in its power to maximize the competitive balance of that rfp
3145483 there is absolutely no way that they could do that
3145484 we are very well positioned and remain confident that strong demand in our key markets in the u s and around the world will continue to drive substantial growth for the company
3145485 with this acquisition we will soon be in a position to respond to the growing demand in the private brand segment and transfer production of our own bars to this new plant generating substantial economies of scale we plan to install the production line in the fourth quarter of 2008 so as to be fully operational as of the first quarter of 2009
3145486 i sell to businesses it involves invoices etc we couldnt do anything like that
3145487 the ahirc database was created in 1998 by the actors fund of america with a grant from the national endowment for the arts as a health insurance resource for artists and people in the entertainment industry since then with support from the commonwealth fund it has expanded to include resources for the self employed low income workers the under insured the uninsured who require medical care and many other groups

3145498 what has been called the long war is likely to be many years of persistent engaged combat all around the world in differing degrees of size and intensity this generational campaign cannot be wished away or put on a timetable there are no exit strategies to paraphrase the bolshevik leon trotsky we may not be interested in the long war but the long war is interested in us
3145499 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u
3145500 the principal challenge therefore is how to ensure that the capabilities gained and counterinsurgency lessons learned from iraq and afghanistan as well as the lessons re learned from other places where we have engaged in irregular warfare over the last two decades are institutionalized within the defense establishment
3145501 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3145502 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3145503 t mobile is working with the industry to foster an open wireless services platform which will provide developers with the tools and information they need to make new innovative experiences available to more than 31 5 million customers the devpartner community site which is in its alpha stage is just a taste of what t mobile has in store and we encourage you to stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks

3145505 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3145506 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3145507 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3145515 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3145516 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3145517 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3145524 now we know that fat tissue is hormone producing tissue it may act differently in different people
3145525 the higher an obese persons activity level the larger the decrease in liver fat
3145526 in our study the obese people with better risk profiles tended to have more physical activity and the normal weight people with worse risk factors tended to have characteristics associated with lower physical activity levels
3145527 for any particular disease there are many people with risk factors that do not get the disease and many people without risk factors who do
3145528 weve known for a long time that although obesity is a risk factor for heart disease many obese people dont have that risk but across the population those with more body fat will have an increased incidence of heart disease and those with the apple shaped upper body obesity are at greater risk than those with the pear shaped lower body obesity

3145587 our nations future security and prosperity depends on the next president making the hard choices that will break our nations strategic dependence on foreign sources of energy and will ensure our economic prosperity by meeting tomorrows demands for a clean portfolio
3145588 with the strategic decision to sell our only phase i clinic in june we will be able to focus on continuing operations and to stress profitable operations while the current quarter had a slight decrease in net income from continuing operations compared to a very strong quarter in the same period last year our nine month results showed a 38 increase in pre tax income from continuing operations compared to last year we also increased our cash flow from continuing operations for the nine month period from 3 4 million to 4 1 million we are very encouraged by these results from our continuing operations
3145589 with approximately 95 million in cash and receivables at the end of the second quarter of 2008 a decreased level of r amp d activities and the workforce reduction we implemented during the second quarter we continue to focus our efforts on evaluating various strategic alternatives for novacea

3145591 during the second quarter we continued to see our revenues transition from legacy tdm services to data and ip services
3145592 on a year over year basis our data and ip revenues grew over 32 which underscores the strength of xos network and our ability to deliver scalable high performance network services for our customers
3145593 the completion of this financing gives us the financial strength and flexibility that we need in order to support fast growing areas of our businesses
3145594 at a time when the capital markets have tightened dramatically we have strengthened our balance sheet and have significant cash available which positions us to pursue opportunities that create value for our shareholders
3145595 overall we have made significant progress this quarter in many areas which are important to our success first we have addressed our financing issue which gives us the financial flexibility we need to achieve our growth initiatives next we continue to invest in new network infrastructure expanding our ethernet footprint finally we are developing new products which will accelerate our transition to data and ip services
3145596 as a result we are well positioned to continue expanding our customer base in high growth markets

3145630 in the past six years new engineering enrollments at michigan universities have plummeted by more than 13 percent compared to a nine percent increase nationally
3145631 in michigan this precipitous drop is clearly linked to layoffs and poor performance within the domestic auto industry
3145632 forty five percent or more of all chinese college students currently study engineering compared to just 4 5 percent in the united states
3145633 nationally low enrollments at engineering schools are tied to poor high school preparation and low interest levels especially among women and minorities
3145634 more and better educated engineers are needed if our nation and its auto industry are to thrive or even survive
3145635 the problem of low engineering enrollments can only be solved by decisive action that includes changes in public policy and national programs as well as increased collaboration within the educational community government and the private sector

3145660 were kind of out of the hurtin peoples feeling business right now
3145661 heres where we are injury wise at the end of the game kelvin smith during the game he suffered what looks like a pretty serious knee injury were waiting on a little bit more information there but that injury looks to be pretty serious and then charlie anderson in the game he had a little bit of a hamstring deal in the game so hes kind of day to day right now but those are the injuries that came out of the game
3145662 im not sure its really day to day and well be really smart with it but i dont see him practicing today
3145663 not sure right now at this time were still waiting for a little bit more information but its not great
3145664 not positive i think charlies is the left im not sure
3145665 my impressions after watching the game in general are that i thought early in the game they did some nice things they competed really hard whatever its worth in a preseason game the score was 7 6 with ten minutes into the fourth quarter of it i thought he first units competed really well against one another in that game and really did see some really good things at times particularly out of some younger guys in there i was really pleased to see that what we didnt do is we didnt finish so thats something that we talk about i dont really care what the unit is that is out on the field at the time its not an excuse we didnt finish the game and thats the way we practice those are the things we talk about we werent really disciplined throughout the course of the game we had nine penalties there for 60 yards those are things that we preach about we had a couple of minus plays out there which are also things that we talk about we really didnt get the ball away from them meaning they didnt turn it over now with that being said neither did we which is a good thing
3145666 right now weve seen an awful lot of a couple of guys here of three players so we can see a little bit less maybe of the three players there as we get on in this we know we obviously have to get chad pennington work as well here so well work it around that way it might be a little bit dominant in here early well see how it goes where a couple of guys get a couple more reps then a few other guys
3145667 well thats interesting i think to learn an offense i think a guy can learn the offense and have a pretty good grasp of the offense in a week to two weeks time i really do depending on who that guy is now chad pennington coming to us and this was well thought out is when we came here really my first time in dallas when i learned our offense with bill parcells that was the same offense that dan henning was involved in so when we came here my notebook and dans notebook were put together and thats kind of the way we developed our offense here and kind of the way were going to attack this thing to be honest with you chad pennington is pretty familiar with some of the terminology this is going to be a little bit easier than it would be anybody else
3145668 were using my terminology one of the greatest things is formations and how you get guys lined up thats the biggest part that comes out of the quarterbacks mouth in the huddle usually is the formation and those things are pretty consistent so chad pennington i think would have pretty good recall that way in fact i know he does
3145669 ill tell you two things i thought that were really telling to me first of all he did step up in the pocket and he did make a couple of pretty good throws in there one of those throws was im going to say to anthony armstrong in the game and then the other one was to david kircus those are two pretty good throws i mean really big league throws the ball out of bounds there was another deal during the course of this game we drill it all the time out here and we talk about it a lot but from a field goal standpoint our second score we were probably on about the 36 yard line at the time somewhere in that range maybe a little bit longer but we were just outside of what we thought might have been dan carpenters field goal range and we went back to pass and chad henne was smart enough there not to take a sack put the ball down and get positive yards out of this which was something we talked about i think he might have gained four yards in that situation and gave us the opportunity to make a field goal thats a heads up play for a young guy to make some young guys would take the sack there in that situation and you have no chance for a field goal the other thing i thought is that he got hit twice in that game it didnt bother him at all
3145670 i thought that the first team offensive line the course of that game aside of the first two plays of the game which we were not quite on the same page with played pretty well i was pleased with what they did in there i was really pleased as a group with what they did but obviously when you look at your young players donald thomas being out there for the first time i was pleased with what donald did during the course of the game there are a lot of things he has to get better at and we talked about it and jake long the same kind of deal i thought jake played pretty well in that ball game and got challenged a little bit in that game some speed rush up the field and he handled it pretty well he was pretty good in the run game again some things he has to get better at as well
3145671 i see tremendous strength and he really set the edge a few times he did a nice job that way he put good pressure on the quarterback in some rush situations when i say set the edge i mean in the run game he really set the edge played on the offensive side of the line of scrimmage but in the pass game his pass rush was really solid hes down the middle usually of his defender now that being said we need to work on some things that way down the middle is good but down the middle of a 300 pound tackle every single down we need to come up with a little something different there
3145672 i think sometimes when youre a skill player like that and you dont always get a lot of at bats and it doesnt come to you a bunch you have one or two and then it becomes a confidence thing a little bit one way or the other but hes a pretty confident kid in fact he and i sat down and visited a little today and i told him that i am confident in him and that we just got to get him into a point where we just practice one practice at a time here and we finish that practice and we know we had a good day and we go to the next practice and worry about it maybe spend a little bit more time doing some things with him on the jugs weve got four arms in camp now so we can use some of these quarterbacks after practice and do some things that way too
3145673 vonnie is still day to day right now hes doing a lot better we were smart in doing what we did with him as far as joey goes joey had a little bit of a sore back he kind of tweaked it in practice last week it was fine then it kind of flared up on him so it was a little bit sore and we just wanted to be cautious with it that was all it was in that situation it was good for us to be able to see a few of the younger guys too in that deal joey is going to be day to day right now and i would expect joey as we get on in this week to be okay as far as feely goes hes still day to day right now as well and well see where he is
3145674 i think it depends on whats happening out there coverage wise i know when chad henne got out there there was a little bit more man coverage at that time tampa usually plays a lot of two deep and tries to keep the ball underneath you underneath them i should say john had a few of those kind of opportunities where they were playing shell and he had to check the ball down a little bit he made the right decision we have talked a little bit to john just about being able to get the ball down the field you dont want to force feed that to a quarterback and then he goes out and throws three interceptions because hes trying to push the ball one of the big things is that its okay to check the ball down in our offense we threw a check down to reagan mauia to be honest with you we werent in the right place when we threw the check down but we threw the check down to reagan and he gains nine or ten yards thats what you want to see
3145675 obviously i just want to watch him manage the huddle a little bit and see how he does that way see exactly what his recall is were going to get him out there and let him go a few reps hell grab a bunch of reps today and were going to watch him and see what his recall is i want to watch him throw the ball a little bit but more importantly just how he interacts with the players and the team hes already done that its kind of been a pretty nice couple days transition that way you could feel his presence around a little bit
3145676 catching the ball i want them to catch the ball and i want to see run after the catch but your question is a good question the other thing is man to man i dont think were doing a great job at the second level avoiding people theyre getting their hands on us a little bit its happened in practice they disrupt the route there a little bit we need to have a better plan at the second level from a receivers standpoint and we have to win in man to man situations we have to win

3145691 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use

3145783 i think because of the ruud situation it was an opportunity to once and for all look for a fresh start alexis been with us a long time im very appreciative of everything hes done for the galaxy that one is painful we havent made the playoffs for two years running and were headed for a third year you cant blame alexi entirely i do think we need a fresh start

3145984 our main concern is safety safety for the people and safety for the children we want to have children but we were so upset last night we would never consider having children if something like this went up
3145985 the economy has been in kind of a downturn for a couple of years now you see it in all aspects of life as i said it affects everything and it goes all the way down to the animals
3145986 the main focus is for people to try and take care of the pets that they presently have they may have to make some adjustments they may have to cut some coupons look for deals and that would help them out
3145987 hopefully we wont have to see too many more pets coming into the facility

3146002 we really dont know as much about obesity as we think we do
3146003 a considerable proportion of overweight and obese u s adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities
3146004 our study shows you can still be healthy even if you are obese
3146005 altogether 10 percent of the study population and 25 percent of the obese subjects had a high insulin sensitivity phenotype or metabolically benign obesity
3146006 our data suggest that ectopic fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3146007 thats an area that we are very intrigued with as well
3146008 if you start stuffing people with calories it is very much like making pate from goose liver
3146009 she thought she deserved parity and shes got a point
3146010 perhaps the most alarming issue we are seeing with black henna tattoos is the increase in the number of children even children as young as four who are getting them and experiencing skin reactions
3146011 kids make up a significant portion of the population that receives temporary tattoos because parents mistakenly think they are safe since they are not permanent and are available at so many popular venues catering to families in fact nothing could be further from the truth
3146012 there have been hundreds of reports of black tattoos causing allergic contact dermatitis
3146013 redness and itching bumps swelling and blisters topical steroids can help with some of the allergy symptoms
3146014 each exposure to ppd re challenges the immune system so each time you get a black henna tattoo or use a hair dye that contains ppd there is an increased risk of having a reaction
3146015 many people are sensitized to ppd but dont have a reaction to it however each time you are exposed to black henna you increase your risk of developing a lifelong allergy to it
3146016 unless the artist can tell you exactly whats in the tattoo dont get one
3146017 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3146018 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3146019 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3146020 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3146021 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3146022 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3146023 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3146024 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff

3146028 different things come up like when do you stop painting when is the painting done or what do you do when you are having a slump or your muse is gone we can discuss these things when we are together
3146029 watercolors werent vibrant enough i wanted the intense color of pastels
3146030 i love the immediacy of pastels you can see what youre doing more quickly with this media it is very gratifying it is also very portable i can carry my box with me when doing en plein aire
3146031 i am a believer in knowing what youre doing when you apply for a job uh and i think that if i were to seriously consider running on a national ticket i would essentially have to start now before having served a day in the senate now theres some people who might be comfortable doing that uh but im not one of those people
3146032 yep the republicans have about this much of a chance at winning the general election come november
3146033 australians dont have much respect for the music press it runs counter to their culture australian rock is all about good on ya mate well done for getting up on stage and switching that amplifier on
3146034 the idea of anyone actually daring to criticise musicians for the sound they make is almost heresy
3146035 everyone is treated equally which means no knocking anyone back however great the temptation thatll be why australian rock is best known to the outside world for such musical abominations as silverchair the vines and savage garden
3146036 its a really poor piece of journalism from a music writer who once had relevance and influence but now hes living in australia he doesnt really have the knowledge or experience of the local industry to back up his opinions
3146037 its just a shame he gets to hide under the masthead of the guardian which gives him credence where none is due
3146038 i think there are parts of the british press that seem to enjoy denigrating their subjects
3146039 but i certainly dont think it is something that happens all the time
3146040 total design is nothing more or less than a process of relating everything to everything
3146041 we started doing some initial mapping of the circuit several months ago from architect plans and fia information
3146042 we created a rough map of the circuit and then we ran our simulation around it to see things like aero levels and look at the potential for high brake wear or what kind of demands the circuit will put on the tyres
3146043 so in the case of aero levels we can make new parts to suit that particular circuit and then as you come nearer the time you can get more information from the organisers and the fia and you just build up the picture and refine the simulation
3146044 nothing beats walking around the circuit with the drivers chatting about problems looking at the kerbs the amount of run off area how close you are to the wall
3146045 im going to watch the onboard from some of the gt racing to get a good idea of the track
3146046 but then its really taking a guess on the set up comparing with other street circuits like monaco and from then well just have to take it step by step through the weekend
3146047 on a street circuit like that the problem is that there is no grip at the beginning
3146048 for all the teams everyone is starting at zero more or less with the track the drivers the set up and everything
3146049 so its going to be a big challenge for everybody to get the best out of it as quickly as possible it is going to be a really interesting race
3146050 i dont think anyone could say with certainty that under english law it will be rock solid for ever
3146051 the decision is hard on chambers but essential for athletics and sport in general
3146052 many people both inside and outside sport would see this by law as unlawful
3146053 but in my judgment it would take a much better case than the claimant has presented to persuade me to overturn the status quo at this stage and compel his selection for the games
3146054 there might have been different results and outcomes had the timetable been different
3146055 in hindsight maybe dwain chambers was poorly advised waiting until he had secured the qualifying time to then bring his case which compressed it into a very short timeframe
3146056 it isnt a black and white situation if the issue gets re opened in the future it will undoubtedly take up a lot of the boas time all over again but in a different way
3146057 uk athletics values the by law very highly but a court of law is different to the opinion of a sports governing body
3146058 i had my doubts as to whether it would stand in court but i see that it does and that is encouraging
3146059 we do not wish to see deliberate cheats participating again in the olympic games and the ioc has already taken some steps in introducing new rules
3146060 there are rules and regulations in life we have to abide to but sometimes i feel that forgiveness is one of those things that weve got to look into
3146061 ok he cant go to the olympics but i think the sport has to rehabilitate him
3146062 yes and i think thats what they need to use him as an ambassador for the sport
3146063 go out there to the kids in the community and say listen this is whats happened to me i made mistakes and sometimes your mistakes come back and bite you in the bum so dont do the same as i did
3146064 this is an important election for all americans but for those involved in agriculture the differences between the candidates is are huge
3146065 we think its important to show our support for the candidate who listens to farmers and understands what it will take to make rural america prosper
3146066 to make their most grateful acknowledgments to their friends and customers for the many favours and civilities they have received and hope by this union they will be enabled to carry on their business to the entire satisfaction of their friends as on their part the strictest assiduity and attention shall be observed
3146067 at present the security work for the olympics is in a key phase and we should mobilize the masses of people to contribute to the security of the games
3146068 security is of the utmost importance in relation to the full success of the olympics
3146069 it was difficult for any investor to make positive returns in stocks this past year but we realized gains in other areas ending the year in good financial shape
3146070 private equity returns led the way in gains fixed income and our new inflation linked asset class were also in positive territory
3146071 it makes a lot of sense for hp to pursue acquisitions like this
3146072 the colubris deal will give hp additional leverage in selling its already well respected networking products more deeply into the vertical markets that represent the bulk of future growth
3146073 we were missing some 802 11n capabilities in our portfolio
3146074 so as we go to market together with a holistic wired and wireless solution we will be able to build incremental synergies

3146083 self forgiveness i dont need a workshop on self forgiveness there are too many people that let themselves off the hook already
3146084 well now that you mention it i do always seem to put myself last its true i am exhausted all of the time
3146085 i dont have time to take better care of myself ive got too many obligations and i dont want to let anyone down
3146086 of course i hold higher standards for myself than i do for other people isnt that normal
3146087 yes i am terribly afraid of making mistakes and i push myself pretty hard to be the best i can be so when i make a mistake i do feel stupid and worthless like a complete failure actually but this is how ive become as successful as i am driving myself to go that extra mile

3146122 the problem with statin therapy is that not all people are good responders to the treatment
3146123 i would say its promising if we can specifically target the rna to the liver
3146124 we do not know what other roles pcsk9 has in the body
3146125 what were very excited about here is by the mechanism you would expect that you get a synergetic effect with statins
3146126 the majority of the cancer patients in this country die because of chemotherapy which does not cure breast colon or lung cancer this has been documented for over a decade and nevertheless doctors still utilize chemotherapy to fight these tumors
3146127 if i were to contract cancer i would never turn to a certain standard for the therapy of this disease cancer patients who stay away from these centers have some chance to make it
3146128 first of all in principle using our roadways on a 24 7 basis makes sense
3146129 maybe they just need to die so the other plants there can live

3146145 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3146146 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3146147 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3146148 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3146149 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3146150 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3146151 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3146152 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials
3146153 is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3146154 you have helped build this movement from the bottom up and barack wants you to be the first to know his choice
3146155 once youve signed up please forward this e mail to your friends family and co workers to let them know about this special opportunity no other campaign has done this before you can be part of this important moment
3146156 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
3146157 obama started negative campaigning on john mccain long before we started punching back and i think a lot of our effort is really to get back into this game try and galvanize some of the public attention back onto this race make sure everybody understands theres two people in this race not just one and i think weve been successful in doing that
3146158 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate cease fire
3146159 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
3146160 using violence against georgia in part to intimidate other neighbors such as ukraine for choosing to associate with the west
3146161 we have no right to judge him or anyone else
3146162 i always thought john edwards was different from the typical politician
3146163 i really dont think he can get into politics again
3146164 i think something that happened two years ago should be a private matter between him and his wife
3146165 it took several months to get there but did it
3146166 that has been a record that has stood the test of time for ten years its held onto that record
3146167 knocking off every other record fastest sprint to 200 million 300 million 400 million in just 24 days
3146168 this film is now up to 441 5 million probably by the end of the week itll beat star wars which is at 461 to become the second highest grossing movie all time in less than a month thats really amazing
3146169 will it beat titanic i dont think so i think itll ultimately be at somewhere around 520 million domestically thats still amazing and to do it this fast ive never seen anything like it
3146170 the repeat business and its become a cultural phenomenon that made titanic such a huge hit back in 1997 and 98 when it was playing for all those months and dark knight with the late heath ledgers performance its kind of a legendary performance its shrouded in mystique and that is really getting people talking and theyre going back to see it over and over again to relive that performance by heath ledger
3146171 the comic book genre is not for everyone or superhero movies but this movie is transcending the genre its a great crime epic so im encouraging people who arent really into this kind of movie to go out and see it because its so great although by this point probably everyones seen its it seems like

3146178 is it possible that he wanted to help them because they were in a difficult time of course is it possible that he was worried that in fact something had happened with me and he wanted to help i mean i think all these things are possible
3146179 it gives iphone a justifiable claim to being a viable gaming platform
3146180 we studied one of the systems that remove damaged proteins
3146181 the liver cells were able to maintain the same level of activity as when they were young
3146182 as we understand why this system decreases with aging we are trying to identify compounds that do the same thing
3146183 also we are looking at dietary manipulation some modifications in the diet might do the same thing
3146184 another piece of evidence supporting the contention that aging is a reversible condition we can not only slow aging but also reverse many forms of aging
3146185 from the pure science point of view it is impressive

3146189 i felt he really was so committed to that character the guy that was playing that guy that as an audience you bought his sincerity very few people i think could pull that off
3146190 robert was black the whole time my mom came on the set and she thought it was don cheadle
3146191 to me the most important thing was alpa chino has to give him a beat down and tell him that what hes doing is crazy the whole time
3146192 otherwise its just demeaning to brandons character and if its demeaning to an actual black man in the movie i would have run for the hills
3146193 if were all gonna play ball lets all play ball
3146194 i believe in fairness if we can punch you punch back and funny is funny
3146195 this sort of self important self involved thing seemed funny to me
3146196 i just couldnt figure a way to make that into a movie
3146197 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3146198 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3146199 you go out there and put your best foot forward in terms of what you think youre doing of what you think is the right idea
3146200 if people are accepting it the way that you intended and you feel that from a general audience then stand behind it
3146201 i just hope at this point with whatever little weve done to brand ourselves as entertainers that you give us a little slack
3146202 it hurts i think its something that no one should ever have to go through
3146203 but lifes not fair so its never going to be about that at the end of the day it happened and it seems that the sooner we can come to grips with that and process it the better off were going to be
3146204 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence theres no indication here of any premeditation or anything

3146219 the period between early july and early september when the hot sultry weather of summer usually occurs in the northern hemisphere
3146220 t he name dog days originated with the ancient greeks romans and egyptians they believed that sirius the dog star added its heat to the suns and thereby caused the hot weather
3146221 the old farmers almanac lists the traditional timing of the dog days for the northern hemisphere as the 40 days beginning july 3 and ending august 11

3146239 since he took office martin omalley has used the maryland department of transportation for flashy environmental promises instead of providing core service to maryland travelers
3146240 the states marc train service is breaking down buses are being recalled and maryland drivers are still mired in horrific traffic jams on the states highways
3146241 what we have here is just another omalley broken promise maryland s mass transit systems are breaking down despite the governors campaign promise to make mass transit a priority this comes at a time when marylanders are turning to marc trains and mta buses more and more to get to work clearly this record of failure indicates a need for change in 2010

3146293 edwards affair was media part of a conspiracy of silence
3146294 rumors about john edwards love affair had been circulating for months but it wasnt until the former democratic presidential candidate admitted to the affair that national news organizations jumped on the story after the national enquirer reported catching edwards making a late night visit to see his ex mistress last month the blogosphere exploded asking why the mainstream media was not reporting the story
3146295 was it because of a condescending attitude toward a tabloids reporting bias toward a democratic candidate or sympathy toward elizabeth edwards who is battling an incurable form of cancer
3146296 david carr a columnist for the new york times said many news organizations
3146297 they have been very right about some things but theres been some misses too so its a little scary to follow on those stories
3146298 its also a little scary for big outfits to step up on a story like this sex may sell but it can really hurt your relationship with readers
3146299 asked by cnns howard kurtz if sympathy for elizabeth edwards played any part in an apparent reluctance to report the story abc correspondent kate snow said no
3146300 we at abc were working on this story and if we had had any proof and any verifiable facts we certainly would have gone with the story
3146301 it was just a matter of were not going to put something on the air until we know that its true
3146302 brian ross abcs chief investigative correspondent said his investigative team was pushing hard following the money trail looking at such things as who paid for hunters fancy california home and the use of campaign funds
3146303 as ross worked on the money angle his colleague bob woodruff landed an interview with edwards
3146304 until he called and its on the record that he called us on friday and said i want to talk you know thats what broke the story he was willing to admit that he had been lying
3146305 kurtz said news organizations were clinging to a very important standard dont run allegations that you cant prove
3146306 i think at that point we should have earlier than we did told readers and viewers what we knew and we didnt know
3146307 but with questions still looming about the identity of the childs father and the enquirer standing by its reporting the blogosphere will probably keep this story alive
3146308 members of the public people with modems people with cell phones are now producers editors they can push and push and push on a story until it ends up being acknowledged by everyone
3146309 david carr a columnist for the new york times said many news organizations
3146310 they have been very right about some things but theres been some misses too so its a little scary to follow on those stories
3146311 members of the public people with modems people with cell phones are now producers editors they can push and push and push on a story until it ends up being acknowledged by everyone
3146312 was it because of a condescending attitude toward a tabloids reporting bias toward a democratic candidate or sympathy toward elizabeth edwards who is battling an incurable form of cancer
3146313 until he called and its on the record that he called us on friday and said i want to talk you know he was willing to admit that he had been lying
3146314 well we had to wait for him to admit it before reporting on it
3146315 the affair began long long long before she was hired to work for the campaign almost half a year before she was hired to work on those videos
3146316 david carr a columnist for the new york times said many news organizations
3146317 they have been very right about some things but theres been some misses too so its a little scary to follow on those stories
3146318 its also a little scary for big outfits to step up on a story like this sex may sell but it can really hurt your relationship with readers
3146319 i was taught when i was a young reporter that its news when we say it is

3146326 that a democratically elected president of georgia and i quote must go
3146327 id like to say straightaway that regime change is an american expression
3146328 we do not use such an expression but sometimes there are occasions and we know from history that there are different leaders who come to power either democratically or semi democratically and they become an obstacle
3146329 without the departure of saakashvili it is impossible to stop the conflict in south ossetia
3146330 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
3146331 only one of those warheads have to work to kill a hell of a lot more people than we are talking about right now does it suck yes but thats the way it is
3146332 the second you drop in an airborne division or brigade if you can find one at the moment no cycling up of down from deployment or a carrier group or anything with an american flag on it this fucking border war becomes ww iii then nukes are very much in the picture
3146333 look this is a real problem we need a real strategy not some fanciful tough guy talk
3146334 its hard not to agree with that guy we need to help
3146335 more to the point the reason the soviets backed down and prevented a shooting war is exactly because neither the us or ussr was willing to run the risk of doing exactly what people who claim we should throw troops into georgia want to do
3146336 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
3146337 its hard not to agree with that guy we need to help
3146338 im not going to start the third world war for you

3146386 chrysler is offering almost 6 000 in rebates to customers before they even talk to a salesperson
3146387 this is a very aggressive program that combined with low interest rates should counteract any effect not having a lease option would have
3146388 with gas prices being so high we see a lot more customers hanging on to their vehicle especially if it is fuel efficient
3146389 thats probably where chrysler will see a dip in sales
3146390 the letter said that i wouldnt see much of a change if i wanted to purchase a new jeep when my lease is up
3146391 i just dont see how this is true because a person typically puts something like 3 000 down for a lease and if you change that to a down payment on a 30 000 new vehicle purchase your monthly payments would be over 2 000
3146392 i have enjoyed leasing a jeep and if they continued the program i would not have had a second thought about leasing another jeep
3146393 but with this change in policy and the current cost of gas i am going to have to take a look at changing my strategy in choosing a vehicle
3146394 argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined

3146396 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3146397 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3146398 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3146399 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3146428 the government is cutting cultural programs to please its ideological base
3146429 the conservatives still dont understand that in a free and democratic country artists should be able to create without fear and what they deserve is help from our leaders not threats
3146430 the idea of the center is not only to help sailors and marines in distress but to promote good stress management and promote psychological health so it starts when people come into boot camp and lasts all of the way until they graduate from war college
3146431 the idea is that we get past the concept of just dealing with things when they are in crisis and hopefully promote a system of addressing stress and addressing our ability to cope with it so we rarely get into a crisis mode
3146432 one of the things that i like to look at when people are training and they go through drills is how can we incorporate stress training into that so that they are more aware of when they are dealing with stress
3146433 when we talk about operational stress were talking about that unique set of circumstances that people have when they are deployed or when they are in the jobs that they do
3146434 for example somebody who works on the deck of an aircraft carrier has a much different level of stress than someone who is a civilian and works in an office building downtown
3146435 combat stress of course is the stress that occurs when you are in combat the extreme set of circumstances when your life is in danger and when you have to make life and death decisions quickly and when you are under extreme pressure

3146480 however housing activity is definitely on a downward trend consistent with indications of deteriorating affordability through last year this factor is expected to keep new residential construction activity under pressure going forward our forecast assumes that starts will drop on average 5 3 per cent this year and 14 8 per cent next year
3146481 the world banks lending record does not match up to zoellicks rhetoric
3146482 the institution is simply not slowing down its significant funding to fossil fuel projects that will emit greenhouse gases for 20 to 40 years
3146483 the mission of the world bank group is to alleviate poverty and one way it does that is to increase access to energy
3146484 the oil industry certainly does not need soft loans from a multilateral poverty reduction agency
3146485 the private sector can do this perfectly well on its own
3146486 the world bank has become very dependent on fossil fuel loans in order to maintain its own financial strength
3146487 meet the challenge of climate change without slowing the growth that will help overcome poverty
3146488 conventional oceanographic platforms cannot provide observations under the sea ice particularly on the antarctic continental shelf where the most important water mass transformations take place
3146489 until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result
3146490 maybe it will encourage people to reflect on what we really should be doing
3146491 what has gotten ignored in this debate is the looming of global warming and the need to end our dependence on fossil fuels
3146492 i dont know anyone who thinks we are going to see 60 a barrel oil again

3146497 they delivered two to the house across the street and its been vacant since last october
3146498 for all their seeming brilliance over the past couple of years i believe a couple of their off season moves have now caused them to make more stupid moves to try to fix those

3146506 vamos creciendo cada d a mejoramos un poco m s yo dir a que hoy estamos mucho mejor que hace una semana y tenemos que seguir por este camino
3146507 ahora hay que luchar para ganar ante australia tenemos que hacerlo porque de lo contrario se complicar an las cosas m s adelante yo veo al grupo entero y con ganas de salir ya mismo a jugar
3146508 el grupo est muy bien nos toc perder contra un gran equipo como lo es lituania en un partido muy parejo que se nos escap sobre el final y que estaba para cualquiera de los dos son cosas que pasan
3146509 es cierto que recibimos un golpe duro pero ya es parte del pasado y ahora hay que salir con todo en todos los partidos que faltan para poder so ar con el podio otra vez
3146510 quiero volver a festejar falta una buena alegr a que ojal sea poder ganar ante australia y despu s volver a casa con una medalla colgada
3146511 qu nos falta primero estar en zona de medalla una vez que estemos ah ojal que podamos pelear por el mejor color el objetivo es muy dif cil pero vamos a pelear
3146512 ganar una medalla es algo nico en los juegos por eso todos tienen el sue o de estar en un podio ol mpico de eso no hay dudas

3146525 they definitely look like theyre oversold but i would say the market sentiment is still very negative so i think they still have room to go down

3146554 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3146555 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3146556 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3146557 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3146558 it means that well likely see vegetation shift a lot faster than we might think
3146559 the plant death was striking and occurred in most species
3146560 the occurrence of plant death was obvious to everyone living in that area

3146589 tendr graves consecuencias para las relaciones con los estados unidos
3146590 well we were monogamous the first year we dated i think its important to establish a relationship first before opening it up but were both in our early twenties and we knew when we first met that we were way too young to be strictly monogamous
3146591 being with a couple is one thing but being in a couple and bringing in another i couldnt do it
3146592 other girls i know who are in open relationships often say the funny thing about it is the more you date other people the more you appreciate your relationship and the less you want to date others
3146593 my man will meet one of the guys i am dating and hell tell me later that guys not up to your level he does it in a really sweet way too it isnt like hes trying to put down the guy out of jealousy he truly wants me to be with men who respect and appreciate me
3146594 it isnt easy you have to communicate a lot for it to work i mean sure i have buttons that can be pushed and i can get jealous like if he dates a petite blonde everything i am not its hard not to feel a little jealous but you talk about it work through it and grow so far its worked for us
3146595 pregnant youre sure course youre sure or you wouldnt tell me mine right
3146596 yeah yeah i think i am i mean i never even considered being a dad before so yeah its a shock but um yeah i can do this jade i mean im not going anywhere im here and ill be here whatever you need or want okay
3146597 garret i dont know what to do this is the second child ive been given that im not prepared for i gave the last one away and now im rethinking that decision should i consider an abortion garret i mean if johnny finds out were done he wont understand us and he wont believe me that there really isnt anything between us
3146598 whoa wait a minute no that aint happening no abortion well make john see the truth you an me jade i want this baby okay
3146599 garret its a lifetime commitment you know i mean it would bind us and johnny will be mad
3146600 hey babe come on do i look like a guy whod walk out on you hummm shit girl we already have bonded havent we ill help ya handle john if he gets mad he can take it out on me okay
3146601 can i say i love you without it being weird
3146602 hummmm i missed you too so garrets staying for dinner
3146603 yes it is well have it on the table when ya get back
3146604 hes seems like hes in a good mood sure ya want to do this tonight
3146605 yes needs to be out in the open all the way round thanks for being here and for helping me cook tonight
3146606 no problem hopefully he wont beat the shit out of me once he finds out
3146607 johnny um i have something i need to tell you
3146608 um you know ive not been using anything for birth control lately and um well i know weve been careful but the thing is im pregnant johnny
3146609 shit jenna im sorry i thought itd be okay damn flimsy rubbers
3146610 i didnt think it would hurt a rubber broke one time a couple weeks ago then another one couple nights later i tossed the box an bought a new one but well too late obviously sorry i didnt tell you just didnt think it would matter ya know
3146611 um john look i know its a shock but we didnt mean it really it just happened
3146612 garret damn it johnny i can explain no we didnt but yes we did
3146613 what the fuck does that mean either ya did or ya didnt did you fuck him when
3146614 while i was out of town i called you shit you cheated on me god you fuckin whore
3146615 johnny garret and i got a bit drunk it wasnt planned it was just sex shit the next morning we barely remembered it honest
3146616 so what youre sayin is you two fucked only once
3146617 but he didnt wear protection so so both of us could be the father then
3146618 yeah i guess thats what it means and i have no idea what to do johnny

3146625 on behalf of my family we would like to thank the air force for establishing an equal opportunity award in honor of my f ather and the many years of dedicated service to the eo community
3146626 it is my understanding this new award is to recognize outstanding eo professionals who exemplified superior leadership in ersity and affirmative action it is heartwarming to know this award will be considered the most prestigious award for an eo professional who like my father did the most to advance the air force eo program in a given year

3146631 there is less anti semitism in kazakhstan than in other parts of the former soviet union
3146632 there have been no reported attacks or vandalism against jewish institutions in this country as the muslims tend to be more devout than the christians they have more respect for our religion
3146633 my feeling definitely is that most of the country areas will not get the benefits that would flow through to the more populous areas until its virtually at crisis point on each occasion
3146634 is that the founders of these disciplines envisioned the same thing that you have this broad dispersal of all of the organisms that each happened to be studying and that they would colonize the surface of the earth depending on whether the environment was suitable for them
3146635 before now all biologists could do was look at the biodiversity of microbes that could be cultured in a petri dish we now know that the vast majority of microbial life cannot be kept in captivity now we have the ability to grab dna from the environment and try to characterize different species or taxonomic groups using genetic material allowing our field to blast off
3146636 we are just beginning to scratch the surface of what these patterns look like
3146637 was that the diversity gradient more correlated with temperature than primary productivity
3146638 sackler colloquium in the light of evolution biodiversity and extinction
3146639 from our study we saw that environmental selection seemed to play a larger role and was more important for microbes than the plants
3146640 you have to be careful about the conclusions that you make
3146641 so on a 2 000 meter elevation gradient for example the spatial scale relative to the body size of a plant is much much larger when you consider what the universe looks like to a microbe
3146642 diversity patterns on mountainsides have been studied mostly on plants and animals for hundreds of years
3146643 yet microbes are the most diverse set of organisms on earth and they are really important for how ecosystems work our study establishes the first elevation gradient pattern for microbes we found that yes microbes do have a diversity pattern that is similar to what has been studied for plants and animals but the pattern is different than what you see for plants in the rockies and there is much to be done to understand why microbes might have a different biodiversity pattern
3146644 i dont think that microbes are fundamentally different from a biological standpoint from plants and animals i think that we havent figured out how to study them in an analogous way
3146645 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3146646 both the fungus and the birds eat chilies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
3146647 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3146648 having such a specific defense one that doesnt harm reproduction or dispersal is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant and i think it is a great example of the power of natural selection
3146649 by contrast peppers increase their chemical defense levels or their heat as they ripen this is a very different model and peppers can get away with it because birds dont sense pain when they eat capsaicin
3146650 i think a lot of plants would love to come up with this way of stopping fungal growth without inhibiting dispersers its just very hard to do
3146651 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3146652 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3146653 in the north any adaptive benefit to using eating chilies would be much smaller than at the equator because microbial infection of food is less common and its easier to keep food cold maybe thats why food in the north can be so boring
3146654 along the equator without access to refrigeration you could be dead pretty quickly unless you can find a way to protect yourself against the microbes you ingest every day
3146655 if you think all this is about ribbons and pretense and flattery you have missed the point it matters because this is a search for excellence and it encompasses every emotion talent and hope known to mankind in that search for excellence we become stronger more sure of ourselves and we grow in ways they will never teach you in school i can think of no other way in the path of personal development and awareness that brings us so close to nature and to our own potential if that isnt important then what is

3146657 republican power and republican minority leader mitch mcconnells power are built on oil money
3146658 since 1996 more than three fourths of oil and gas industry contributions have gone to republicans the industry gave 2 4 million to republican senators during the years mcconnell was in charge of their fund raising his colleagues showed their gratitude by making him their leader republican power and mcconnells power are built on oil money
3146659 what mcconnell is doing is good for the oil industry and may even prove to be smart politics but its not responsible leadership
3146660 franken struck an aggressive tone from the outset criticizing coleman for taking contributions from oil companies

3146665 you know in politics it always seemed to me there were certain things that may not be written in the rules about how you should campaign but were acknowledged as things you just dont do one is you dont attack a persons family another is that you can speak in pretty hard terms but you just dont get vulgar about it
3146666 has shifted so hard toward the democrats in recent years that no place may be more emblematic of a national political climate in which republican incumbents like senator john e sununu are battling to keep their jobs
3146667 since the first sununu jeanne shaheen contest in 2002 new hampshire republicans have lost an 11 point edge among registered voters each party now has 31 percent of the electorate with 38 percent undeclared in the states presidential primaries this year 62 percent of independents who voted chose a democrat
3146668 so far mrs shaheen seems to have an edge she has been ahead in the polls for more than a year often by double digits
3146669 national democrats are expected to spend heavily on her behalf
3146670 will spend about 115 000 to air an issue ad

3146681 our objective was to increase the efficiency of cleaning the bolts
3146682 we set out with one goal in mind take one task that was both difficult and time consuming and improve it
3146683 what we found was a better way of doing the same job in less time and more efficiently
3146684 the old process just took so long and it required more than one person to get the bolts cleaned in a reasonable time
3146685 with the new process it has cut down the time dramatically we dont have to use wire brushes and there is no solvent that has to be used
3146686 the airmen now actually see tangible results from thinking smarter they are now looking at each shop related task and brainstorming on how to improve it

3146689 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3146690 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3146691 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3146692 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3146693 it means that well likely see vegetation shift a lot faster than we might think
3146694 the plant death was striking and occurred in most species

3146714 the accelerometer itself measures acceleration that recognises sense of gravity within the computing world this technology is used within laptops in order to protect data stored on the hard drive
3146715 it is likely that the disk drive read write head will collide with the surface of the platter this is where the data is stored causing an indentation and creating debris that will circulate within the drive enclosure often resulting in further damage
3146716 the accelerometer is designed to prevent this it recognises the change in motion and signals to the hard drive that an impact is imminent the read write head is then moved to the parked position where damage to the hard drive is minimised
3146717 earthquake detection requires the continuous measurement of seismic activity over a long period of time and predicting the location of the epicentre is particularly difficult

3146741 with the olympic opening ceremonies only days away we knew that we had to move quickly
3146742 we had three goals first we wanted to quickly create an online resource for people who had been defrauded second we wanted to alert the world about the scam because the various olympic committees did not appear to be doing so and third we wanted to be able to update the web site at a moments notice as developments occur brandextracts people and technology worked perfectly with our law firm
3146743 we have never populated optimized launched and marketed a site so quickly and the law firm staff made it happen with our sam web content management system

3146771 we can now provide high quality dvr capabilities to almost all of our customers in a very short period of time
3146772 it changes cables competitive posture against satellite it makes the services less expensive to provide and it makes it easier to upgrade the services
3146773 cablevision has been innovative here and i think other cable companies will follow them
3146774 in short order effective dvr penetration could now jump to north of 60 percent of cable households that is all digital cable subscribers
3146775 that means a huge increase in the number of viewing hours per day potentially subject to ad skipping
3146776 it allows advertisers to do things they cant do on a physical dvr
3146777 lets say you record an episode of lost three months later you want to play it back the advertising that was on lost is stale and no longer applies but the capability to refresh the advertising exists if the content owner wants to do that with the cable operator

3146786 well we met and ummm i dunno it just happened
3146787 the most memorable discouragement came during his residency from a pulmonologist
3146788 the particular focus of geriatrics training is the care of frail elders where understanding how to assess and determine the individuals ability to function is oftentimes every bit as important as understanding their diseases
3146789 caring for frail older people is about managing not curing a collection of overlapping chronic conditions like osteoporosis diabetes and dementia it is about balancing the risks and benefits of multiple medications which often cause more problems than they solve and it is about trying non medical solutions like timed trips to the bathroom to improve bladder control
3146790 youll get reimbursed better if you remove a wart than if you take the time to talk about how somebodys doing after their husband passed away
3146791 coordinating care its calling families its coordinating with other doctors its stuff that takes a lot of time that is frequently off hours at nights and on weekends and also cognitive care that youre not compensated for
3146792 one of 45 medicine residents decides to be a geriatrician
3146793 of 145 medical schools in the united states only 9 have departments of geriatrics few schools require geriatric courses and teaching hospitals graduate internists with as little as six hours of geriatric training
3146794 a per beneficiary per month stipend for care management paid directly to the patients designated personal physician
3146795 medicare reimbursement for cognitive evaluation and management has been losing ground compared with technological services reimbursement is also needed for telephone management coordinating care in and across various settings and communicating with family caregivers and with other health agencies
3146796 strategies to increase recruitment to the field of geriatrics need to include not only better reimbursement but also getting the word out about how satisfying and enjoyable careers in geriatrics really are physicians must see that this work is valued not only by the patients but also by society
3146797 teaching the core principles of their specialty to everyone be they surgeons or discharge planners because it is unrealistic to assume there will be enough geriatricians to go around
3146798 think of true red and champagne which is equal parts of gold and silver

3146805 even if no else was there hed be in there practicing
3146806 watching how passionate he was about it got me into swimming he was a great role model always trying to help someone out
3146807 he was already talking about making the olympics when he got here
3146808 we could tell he had a lot of talent and that he had the drive to do it

3146824 yet he has never served in an important leadership position in government business or the military his ability to perform as a chief executive officer is completely untested
3146825 significantly the democratic candidates share of the popular vote has gone down the last two elections
3146826 obama has compiled a consistently liberal voting record and was named the most liberal senator for 2007 by the national journal this distinction does not augur well for obama john kerry was named the most liberal senator for 2003 the year before he lost the 2004 presidential contest to bush
3146827 so the key to the upcoming election is whether white voters will be more less or equally likely to vote for obama as for kerry i believe the answer is less likely
3146828 on the other hand he demonstrated much less appeal to white voters older voters ages 45 and up voters who earn less than 50 000 per year voters with some or no college education catholic voters and self described moderate voters

3146853 if you dont agree to fix your problems peacefully then get out and dont ever come back
3146854 we still hope to solve the problem with tehran through the diplomatic route but if thats not possible it will be necessary to continue on the path of un security council sanctions
3146855 the offer presented to tehran remains on the table it is generous and responds to irans concerns
3146856 the objective is to keep the door to dialogue open with tehran with these contacts
3146857 he was on his way home from the football game
3146858 so they went to mickey ds but then they went to get a drink they were under 21 so they gave a false id of course he did deny his friends didnt even try they knew hes a muslim guy so he sat and let them be on the way home with the music blasting high and all of his friends they were laughing time away it then began to rain to them it was the same their team had won the game it was a special day suddenly they slid the car began to skid the driver lost control and hit a blue accord the brother lost his life with those who disbelieve and the last thing from his lips was a four letter word

3146867 the plan is that we will downsize by 70 percent by late autumn this year
3146868 this concerns about 150 staff who would start getting termination letters next week
3146869 my view is that the united states if we had a stronger relationship with russia we could exercise strong diplomacy to stop this effort against georgia we should immediately go to the united nations security council condemn russias action and then get the security council to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint and possibly at the same time generate some u n peacekeeping troops the problem though is that we dont have the kind of influence and strength in our relationship with russia to persuade them this has been one of the failures of the bush administration failing to build a strong relationship a mutually beneficial relationship with russia so wed have the kind of influence to persuade them to stop some of these very very dangerous efforts within their territory
3146870 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
3146871 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3146872 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3146873 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3146874 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3146875 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3146876 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials

3146908 we have more xen in production than vmware an open architecture gives us greater scalability and control and we cannot afford to rely on a single vendor
3146909 first install linux then use your linux skills to install vms
3146910 im looking forward to hearing how those vendors explain the value proposition of a product that contains two incompatible virtualization technologies and no management framework other than a thin veneer of an api that is incompatible with the accepted industry standard for management of virtualization

3146921 this has come as a surprise and i am disappointed carlos cuellar has been a great player for the football club and inevitably there has been speculation about him playing in the premiership

3146948 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
3146949 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
3146950 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
3146951 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
3146952 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins

3146954 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
3146955 tres se dieron en el ltimo mes y los otros tres a lo largo del a o
3146956 los tres ltimos casos provienen de ese lugar y es porque esta es una zona intrusada en donde hubo una deforestaci n muy brusca y esta mosquita se desarrolla en la hojarasca por eso es ideal este lugar para su proliferaci n
3146957 todas aquellas personas que tengan picaduras que no sanan de m s de una semana o que se presenten como elevaciones en la piel que tienden a agrandarse que por favor se acerquen al hospital para que podamos hacerles el tratamiento correspondiente porque esto como cualquier enfermedad cuanto antes se lo trate mejor para que deje menos secuelas en el paciente
3146958 los vecinos que tengan hojarasca cerca de sus casas traten de deshacerse de ellas sobre todo los que viven en las 2 000 hect reas pedimos que tengan especial cuidado y los ciudadanos en general tambi n deben evitar la presencia de mosquitos en sus hogares
3146959 everything we shut our eyes to everything we run away from everything we deny denigrate or despise serves to defeat us in the end what seems nasty painful evil can become a source of beauty joy and strength if faced with an open mind
3146960 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
3146961 those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
3146962 all crimes have to be fixed and be analysed later
3146963 we received very reliable information that the russians decided to move towards gori thats why we decided to pull out all our troops and to relocate them to defend tbilisi
3146964 we are right now driving through the town and i see no trace of troops or military vehicles it is absolutely deserted
3146965 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3146966 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3146967 russia of course will take its peacekeeping mission to a logical conclusion we will strive for working relations with all participants of this conflict
3146968 russian peacekeepers and support units are carrying out an operation aimed at preventing georgian forces from regrouping to carry new attacks on south ossetia senaki is one of the places where such actions were underway
3146969 this provocation was aimed at occupying south ossetia abkhazia and then all of georgia
3146970 the eu grand strategy is to develop georgia as an alternative route for caspian oil and gas by bypassing russia
3146971 but if georgia is no longer a safe passageway then all of these schemes for diminished dependency on russia go up in smoke
3146972 the first significant break in russias previous monopoly control over all oil and natural gas from the caspian sea states
3146973 azerbaijan and georgia for example rely on this pipeline for the political independence they often act out
3146974 an alternative pathway for the flow of caspian oil and gas to the west
3146975 georgia has been one of the leading recipients of u s military aid ever since
3146976 this of course infuriated the russians and they determined to try to curb georgias ties to the west in any way they possibly could
3146977 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3146978 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3146979 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3146980 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3146981 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3146982 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3146983 wherein on the basis of serbias moral responsibility for the events of june 28 the murder of the archduke franz ferdinand certain demands would be addressed to her for the suppression in future of great serb propaganda
3146984 it is altogether difficult to foresee the effect which any one political action may produce abroad
3146985 two principles were in sharp conflict the maintenance of austria as a conglomerate of various nationalities and the rise of independent national states claiming their ethnic territories from austria hungary for this reason and not with a view to expiating the murder of franz ferdinand austria hungary had to go to war against serbia
3146986 we consider that that the latest developments such as the crossing of the georgian borders by russian troops changed the dimension of he conflict we therefore call upon russia to stop immediately all military activity on georgian territory
3146987 we are providing through this funding of one million euros in areas such as basic emergency shelter tents for example or food or water and sanitation all these issues need to be dealt with when you have populations on the move
3146988 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
3146989 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used
3146990 russia has already begun consultations with the ambassadors of the nato countries and consultations with nato military representatives will be held tomorrow
3146991 we will caution them against continuing to further support of saakashvili
3146992 it is an undisguised aggression accompanied by a mass propaganda war
3146993 start military action against abkhazia however the abkhaz fortified region turned out to be unassailable for georgian armed formations therefore a different tactic was chosen aimed against south ossetia which is more accessible territorially
3146994 those with whom he is negotiating georgias accession to nato
3146995 some powerful weapons through the upgrade of su 25 planes and artillery systems in israel
3146996 claiming that us as well as nato and israeli military assistance to georgia is destabilizing the region
3146997 georgia has received 206 tanks of which 175 units were supplied by nato states 186 armored vehicles 126 from nato 79 guns 67 from nato 25 helicopters 12 from nato 70 mortars ten surface to air missile systems eight israeli made unmanned aircraft and other weapons in addition nato countries have supplied four combat aircraft to georgia the russian defense ministry said there were plans to deliver to georgia 145 armored vehicles 262 guns and mortars 14 combat aircraft including four mirazh 2000 destroyers 25 combat helicopters 15 american black hawk aircraft six surface to air missile systems and other arms
3146998 said there were no plans to redeploy the estimated 130 us troops and civilian contractors who he said were stationed in the area around tblisi
3146999 comply with nato regulations in terms of military requirements as well as social conditions
3147000 the btc pipeline considerably changes the status of the regions countries and cements a new pro west alliance
3147001 turkey and israel are negotiating the construction of a multi million dollar energy and water project that will transport water electricity natural gas and oil by pipelines to israel with the oil to be sent onward from israel to the far east
3147002 baku oil can be transported to ashkelon via this new pipeline and to india and the far east
3147003 ceyhan and the mediterranean port of ashkelon are situated only 400 km apart
3147004 georgian casualty figures ranged from 82 dead including 37 civilians to a figure of around 130 dead a russian air strike on gori a georgian town near south ossetia left 60 people dead many of them civilians georgia says
3147005 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path
3147006 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3147007 my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government
3147008 timid men prefer the calm of despotism to the tempestuous sea of liberty
3147009 we are in support of georgia not against the russian people
3147010 essentially russiacopied the serbiaand kosovo scenario one to one crippling of infrastructure destroying military capacity undermining the lawful regime and claiming humanitarian intervention
3147011 it is the european union that can and should be the strong power that induces the russian federationto end its military activity on the territory of the republic of georgia
3147012 war has broken out in europe a european nation has fallen victim to the aggression of its neighbor and the european union as the bearer of european values cannot remain a helpless bystander
3147013 we both understand that the european union faces a very serious and fundamental choice because the russian attacks against georgia unavoidably confront us with the task of reviewing several aspects of current cooperation between the european union and russia
3147014 we will make adjustments to ensure sustained operations and dont anticipate their departure will result in any significant long term impact on the overall security situation in iraq
3147015 they were an important and valued partner and contributed quite a bit to the improved security in wassit province where the bulk of their forces operated with us and our iraqi security force partners
3147016 i do not think that the departure of the georgian soldiers will have an impact on the situation in the province
3147017 there were always language and poor performance problems our security forces can fill any vacuum
3147018 they did not try to give us services instead they were a source of annoyance by delaying us at their checkpoints and mocking the simple locals
3147019 we want to thank them for the great support theyve given the coalition and we wish them well
3147020 weve adapted quite frankly these were good soldiers but weve been able to adapt the battle space to account for their loss
3147021 are conducting an operation to prevent firing on south ossetia and on russian peacekeepers by georgian artillery and the regrouping of georgian forces
3147022 russian forces have occupied the senaki military base which was abandoned
3147023 russian forces are occupying gori georgian armed forces received an order to leave gori and to fortify positions near mtskheta to defend the capital this is a total onslaught
3147024 the evacuation began suddenly when word came that the russians were 5km to 10km from the citys limits i have seen civilians and the army fleeing georgian troops clinging to the back of quad bikes i have seen tanks leaving in no particular formation its panic basically
3147025 the world has a moral duty to stop the madness
3147026 it is obvious the russian invasion had been planned for months and months and months the timing of this intervention has been chosen deliberately with regards to the olympics
3147027 it is so clear what has happened we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of a democratic independent country
3147028 please wake up everybody and make your position and speak with a united voice we are seeing the cold blooded pre meditated murder of a small country
3147029 according to information from peacekeepers in south ossetia georgia continues to use military force and in this regard we cannot consider this document
3147030 cease fire agreement is signed by two sides when they meet we need a written agreement between georgia on one side south ossetia and abkhazia that they will never use force in the future
3147031 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3147032 i mean the transfer by the united states of a georgian contingent in iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone
3147033 the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
3147034 there are fears of propaganda and of disinformation its difficult to form an objective picture
3147035 we will make adjustments to ensure sustained operations and dont anticipate their departure will result in any significant long term impact on the overall security situation in iraq
3147036 they were an important and valued partner and contributed quite a bit to the improved security in wassit province where the bulk of their forces operated with us and our iraqi security force partners
3147037 i do not think that the departure of the georgian soldiers will have an impact on the situation in the province
3147038 there were always language and poor performance problems our security forces can fill any vacuum
3147039 they did not try to give us services instead they were a source of annoyance by delaying us at their checkpoints and mocking the simple locals
3147040 we want to thank them for the great support theyve given the coalition and we wish them well
3147041 weve adapted quite frankly these were good soldiers but weve been able to adapt the battle space to account for their loss
3147042 the flights are ongoing to redeploy the elements of the georgian contingent so that they can deal with the security issues in their country
3147043 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are trying to get in the way i mean the united states using its military transport aircraft to relocate georgias military contingent from iraq virtually into the conflict zone among other things
3147044 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3147045 dont tell tom i was seen outside the compound or ill kill you with my bare hands
3147046 their american trainer rick demont approached me and suggested that roland and lyndon not take part in the time trial he said they had competed in international galas regularly
3147047 i took his word thinking he knew in what kind of form they were
3147048 we did not stand in their way and gave them all the freedom to prepare in any way they wanted to
3147049 we probably do not have the depth that those countries have
3147050 diplomacy is the art of saying nice doggy whilst looking for a really big stick
3147051 hey guys we can use this to solve x y and z
3147052 potentially males of most species can father more offspring than females but this can be strongly influenced by the size or social status of the male with poor quality males failing to breed at all females on the other hand reproduce more consistently if a mother has plentiful resources then it can make sense to invest in producing a son because he is likely to produce more grandchildren than would a daughter however in leaner times having a daughter is a safer bet
3147053 the mindanao situation presents a win win scenario for the administration if the accord on ancestral domain is upheld by the supreme court they can proceed with amending the constitution which they say is needed for the agreement to be effective
3147054 should the hostilities escalate and reach areas outside mindanao the administration will have the basis to declare emergency rule
3147055 mr esperon has shown his loyalty to mrs arroyo since the 2004 elections and he is now directly influencing events in mindanao
3147056 if you cannot manage mindanao at least do not give it away
3147057 it appears that the administration driven by an obsession to extend mrs

3147082 for an earth science prof to make such a basic error is the equivalent of a high school student writing 2 2 5 on a math test

3147092 all the filipino workers are safe and are preparing for possible evacuation they have been issued entry visas to turkey and azerbaijan so they are ready to go if a decision is made
3147093 the decision on when and where to go and how they will do it will depend on the employers of the workers since they are responsible for their safety
3147094 the closeness of mike defensor to mrs arroyo clinched the deal it was clearly an advantage he enjoyed over other filipino businessmen
3147095 there is no level playing field here we might say that cronyism is alive and well under the arroyo administration crony capitalism is back
3147096 i have no objection to bringing in investments to the country but did defensors company get the deal because of his companys track record or simply because the chinese companies know that he and the other officers of the firm are very close to mrs arroyo and could get things done faster
3147097 but in order to find common ground and to move the world toward peace it is important for this country to show respect for the people of the country

3147125 youth drinking is a major pediatric health crisis in this nation and in this state that is not getting better new research has demonstrated the long term and sometimes irreversible effects of alcohol on developing brains this new research demands an urgent response we must get youth and parents to understand the significant and serious health risks associated with youth drinking
3147126 physicians have known since the early 70s that alcohol has a significant irreversible and sometimes devastating effect on the brain of the developing fetus many efforts and programs since that time have provided education to pregnant women around the disastrous effects of alcohol use during pregnancy pediatricians now know that pre adolescent and adolescent brains continue to develop into young adulthood and the effect of alcohol use during this crucial neurological stage of life is no less significant than the effect on a developing fetus that is why it is imperative that we as pediatricians must educate our patients and parents about the dangers of early alcohol use during well child exams as part of our regular anticipatory guidance
3147127 in maine weve been particularly successful at using environmental strategies to reduce other types of youth substance use and the national academy of sciences has already provided us with a roadmap for applying these strategies to underage drinking we know these strategies work because maine has achieved one of the lowest youth smoking rates in the country we can do this for drinking too itll just take all of us working together
3147128 the surgeon generals call to action will help motivate youth and their parents to do more to change the social norms around underage drinking i wish i had grown up in a world where parents didnt host drinking parties where it was hard to get alcohol and where i was not constantly bombarded with images of alcohol and drinking i hope my kids will be able to grow up in a better environment
3147129 we know that younger kids look up to us they cant wait to go to high school and many think they need to give in to peer pressure to drink in order to fit in we hope it means a lot to them to hear from older kids that you dont have to drink to fit in and to have a good time we hope by doing this work some kids will think twice about drinking
3147130 were doing our part and now that the surgeon general has asked people to do more we hope other kids around the state will start to speak out against drinking with their peers as well we think this will start to make a big difference
3147131 we already know what we need to do to prevent underage drinking the surgeon generals call to action now tells us why it is so critical that increase our efforts to implement these recommendations
3147132 the surgeon generals call to action must motivate us all to action our efforts must be more focused more intense and we must use all of the tools at our disposal but we cannot do it alone we need everyone every parent every doctor every educator every community member to get involved and stay involved until we put a halt to this pediatric health crisis
3147133 married people are still healthier than unmarried people but the gap between the married and never married is closing especially for men
3147134 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans with some going so far as to establish social programs and policies to encourage marriage among those social groups less inclined to marry particularly the poor and minorities
3147135 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided

3147141 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last 3 to 6 years that has had an impact on the market
3147142 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3147143 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3147144 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so
3147145 slow down 20 years will pass before you know it

3147170 it is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge
3147171 weve had a great two days at cleveland state the faculty here is wonderful the president is wonderful hes very enthusiastic and it takes having a motivated faculty and a really supportive administration to make this work for students and the community
3147172 this is a perfect example of how we get students out in the community getting to know people
3147173 it helps students not just in terms of applying their skills of what theyve learned in the classroom setting but also their needs wherever you look all of the research shows that learning has improved and it helps build wonderful relationships out in the community so it is a win for everyone involved
3147174 with 7 000 companies and a fairly broad set of international principles to take account of there are quite a lot of different themes and areas that could be focused upon obviously we dont have the resources or possibility to do that so instead we focus on a few specific areas for each strategic period which we can delve into more deeply
3147175 we take a sector wise approach to investigating abuses by the companies we invest in and for child labour in brazil that means the mining sector in india it means the cotton industry and so on
3147176 social issues such as child labour are structural problems connected to poverty and many other themes that we dont expect to solve in six months its a long term effort and my team only began working with this in 2006 but we do feel that the companies are interested in talking to us in that we are given the opportunity to engage in dialogue with receptive ceos and boards
3147177 it naturally helps that we are one of the largest funds in the world they listen to us and now it remains to be seen how our work will affect policy
3147178 the process that takes place with the finance ministrys council of ethics is very thorough and very transparent it makes people take notice something which stock market listed companies hardly enjoy but this approach has a limited capacity they have excluded 27 companies out of the total 7 000 so it can never become the main instrument as it simply cant investigate everyone
3147179 if the finance ministry excludes a company it will garner attention but we lose the ability to influence the companys behaviour and those that buy the stocks we sell may have a completely different agenda than we do when it comes to ethics
3147180 hopefully it makes a lot of sense not only with barcelona but maybe with other clubs too the rationale is that this is a young player that we want and we get him for a reasonable commitment in terms of the fee barcelona have not given up on the boy they still believe in him and they have an option to buy him back in a couple of years if they dont buy him back they will retain 25 of his worth going forward if they do buy him back then we will have 25 of his worth so we have a 25 stake in the worth of a barcelona first team player i think it works and also for however long he is here we have a player who we think will help us improve we have formed a very good relationship with barcelona a young or fringe barcelona player could come here play in our first team play in front of 60 000 and in europe and develop as a player both clubs could benefit from that

3147191 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3147192 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3147193 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3147194 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3147195 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3147196 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3147197 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3147198 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3147199 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3147200 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3147201 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3147202 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3147203 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3147209 it was funny because mike and i really started together in tier ii hockey
3147210 when he left the first year he left niagara falls as an 18 year old to jump to the wha before i got drafted i didnt know he was going to get drafted by washington the next year it was kind of nice knowing that a guy you played together with during the crucial years of your teens would be playing there too we ended up playing together as linemates a little bit when i came up in 84 85 but mike had a great career especially early on i was just enjoying knowing that i played with somebody that i thought would one day be in the hall of fame
3147211 we played new haven who had beaten us 11 of the 14 times we played against them during the regular season
3147212 we went to look at the brand new complex and we said what are we doing here and then we went to look at the old one hersheypark arena i was hard to imagine after all these years that we played in that little barn
3147213 i played for bryan in hershey the year after we won the calder cup
3147214 the following year i went down to binghamton and tore up the league there i think we had like 11 players who ended up playing at least eight years in the national hockey league on that binghamton team to me it was a blessing that i went there
3147215 i played in new haven toward the end of my career buffalo was stockpiling players in rochester to bring up and i wasnt in their future plans so they sent me over to new haven because new haven was more or less a team that would pick up anyone elses scraps so to speak they were an independent team back then at christmas their plan wasnt going so well so they called me back they had me play at rochester the last half of the year
3147216 hershey is at the top of the list because i spent five years there hershey has to be no 1 on the list and rochester no 2 the fan support was unbelievable i really didnt get a chance to get out in the community in rochester because i didnt live there i lived in buffalo then i was in hershey for two years when i was single and two years when i was married diane really loved it there i liked it there the fans really came out and supported the team we were like gods in that town
3147217 i like the way you put that regular season it really is unfortunate that we had to play against the teams within our own division in the playoffs it was just one of those things the islanders were our nemesis i think david did a great job of building that team around four or five guys
3147218 they drafted scotty stevens and bobby carpenter finally developed into the player they thought he was going to be
3147219 unfortunately for us we could never get out of our division in the playoffs we always had to play the islanders i think we played the islanders the first four years the next year we played the flyers in the first round and dale hunter put everyone on his back and carried them that was the year that we should have beaten new jersey but rod langway gets his achilles sliced by patty verbeek just when we were about to get over that hump and go to the final four something like that happens
3147220 it really was i knew exactly what my role was on the hockey team i was a little different player in the american hockey league where i would put up pretty good numbers but knowing that if i wanted to stay in the national hockey league this is what i had to do
3147221 you go to training camp and you look over your shoulder and theres always a guy there who is trying to take your job yvon corriveau and jeff greenlaw were both left wingers they took in the first round it made me that much more determined knowing that they were going to put those guys in but sooner or later theyre going to have to give the hockey team the same kind of energy that i did if they wanted my job i pretty well played knowing that was my job i enjoyed the physical part of the game because it was part of my nature to be physical and i would chip in with a goal here and a goal there
3147222 toronto was probably the most satisfying place to play because growing up as a kid in toronto being born and raised in toronto i sat in front of the tv every saturday night watching the leafs play
3147223 its funny because when the caps dealt me that year on june 10 1989 i was a total free agent at the age of 31 they dealt me before july 1 so technically i was still an unrestricted free agent when july 1 came around and i had a chance to go to pittsburgh and play with mario lemieux back then i thought it was a great idea but i had given my word to toronto the money was the same there werent any money issues but i told pittsburgh that i had to honor my deal i had told the leafs i was going to play there thats where i stayed
3147224 yeah and pittsburgh wasnt that good a hockey team back then i was going to play a larger role on the pittsburgh team because eddie johnston and gene ubriaco really wanted me
3147225 but i was kind of lucky that when i went to toronto doug carpenter was the head coach in toronto
3147226 i went out and scored 21 goals playing on the third line and killing penalties
3147227 i was good for anywhere from 20 to 30 points a year
3147228 twenty one goals might be worth even more but i was just happy playing the money was all irrelevant to me i was just so happy being there and doing what i loved i never came to the rink with a frown on my face it was always with a smile i just loved playing the game i probably could have played until i was 40 years old but they didnt give me the chance i just loved the game that much
3147229 i coached there but it was only because of the dollars and cents they offered me and because i wasnt doing anything back home i played a little bit with the toronto planets in toronto so i got to understand the game a little bit there the buffalo wings at that time wanted a name popular or familiar with the city of buffalo they went with robbie ray at the beginning and robbie was still playing ice hockey at the time so they decided to call me i coached there for two years and that was the last two years that they actually had the game of roller hockey
3147230 you had to be very very patient there was a lot of misdirection it was a completely different game it was four on four and it wasnt a straight north south kind of game it was more of an east west kind of game because if you had a kid who was really good on his wheels and could turn on a dime and go laterally you had a stud you had a really good hockey player on your hands anybody can go straight or in a straight line its a matter of how fast you can change directions going east west and making the defender more or less try to do that at full speed you know hes going to end up on his ass
3147231 it was because i always wanted to stay in the game
3147232 that year i went to the nhl draft in quebec city and talked to ex caps assistant coach doug maclean a little bit
3147233 doug gave me a call and told me lou this is what youve got to do i went there and interviewed for the job and got it we had a great season ended up in second place i screwed up really bad in the playoffs i ended up having a game forfeited because of my stupidity i think ive been blackballed ever since
3147234 it was an incident during the warm up we had a little bit of a flare up in game 5 in our building we almost had a bench clearing brawl as a matter of fact the fights carried themselves right into the dressing rooms the commissioner of the league decided not to show his face in game 6 in flint
3147235 one of our players who was a pretty tough guy skated around the red line and one of their players decided to take a pitch fork shot at him and missed his face
3147236 that was the same year that stevie ludzik coached his first year in muskegon who knows what would have happened at the end of it i still think that was probably the main cause
3147237 i havent had a sniff of anything professional ive had a sniff for coaching tier ii or junior a teams back home some of the jobs i did were because i wasnt working and i figured id like to do something id really enjoy another one i took was a team that had three first year defensemen it was a very young team and all three kids were the owners kids i knew it was going to fail sooner or later but i tried to build that team and it didnt work out for me

3147264 what you guys dont have a specialty dumpling restaurant in kansas city

3147271 the charge sheet is proceeding along well and it will be pretty heavy i think he will resign and not stand for charges in parliament
3147272 we decided that we will back president musharraf there is no question of him quitting he was elected to a five year term
3147273 good riddance to musharraf but what does it really mean
3147274 people are so focused on finding a scapegoat meanwhile the dollar is at 74 rupees and the price of gas is skyrocketing
3147275 in our time political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible things like the continuance of british rule in india the russian purges and deportations the dropping of the atom bombs on japan can indeed be defended but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face and which do not square with the professed aims of political parties thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism question begging and sheer cloudy vagueness defenceless villages are bombarded from the air the inhabitants driven out into the countryside the cattle machine gunned the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets this is called pacification
3147276 i never use a metaphor simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print
3147277 objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account
3147278 by using stale metaphors similes and idioms you save much mental effort at the cost of leaving your meaning vague not only for your reader but for yourself
3147279 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house i just managed to get out of there in time
3147280 there was a very large amount of fire when we arrived it could have been much more serious
3147281 whats even crazier is the states attorney is actually going to prosecute me in court for this
3147282 theyre sniffing along the grass walking on the grass because thats where the dogs want to walk
3147283 if anything i was more surprised with her conduct to continue to allow her dogs to trespass on this property after she had agreed to cease and desist
3147284 from this point forward she began to constantly walk the dogs in our yard
3147285 i would tell her to get the dogs out of the yard always hearing the same responses it is not your yard stating we are harassing her yelling obscenities giving visual obscenities etc
3147286 the dog walking was is an almost every day event
3147287 in order to fetch all families that wish to come back
3147288 damn lucky to be with the hottest girl in the room

3147294 the company and i are very pleased to have been able to acquire these additional parcels as they fit right into our business plan of acquiring properties in this location that offer more then one area of revenue
3147295 it is the intent of the company to acquire land with additional resources assets that could be sold that will enable the company to pay for the land free and clear and then the company will develop said property with huge profit margins to this point i believe we are on the right track
3147296 i walked in one fine summer day in need of a bra fitting
3147297 so i cant order a half dozen nuggets but i can order six

3147308 ostensibly this war is about an unresolved separatist conflict yet in reality it is a war about the independence and the future of georgia and above all it is a war over the kind of europe our children will live in let us be frank this conflict is about the future of freedom in europe
3147309 back into the georgian fold on terms that would fully protect their rights and interests
3147310 but russia which effectively controls the separatists responded to our efforts with a policy of outright annexation
3147311 the separatists began attacking civilians and russian tanks pierced the georgian border we had no choice but to protect our civilians and restore our constitutional order moscow then used this as pretext for a full scale military invasion of georgia
3147312 russias future is at stake can a russia that wages aggressive war on its neighbors be a partner for europe it is clear that russias current leadership is bent on restoring a neocolonial form of control over the entire space once governed by moscow
3147313 if georgia falls this will also mean the fall of the west in the entire former soviet union and beyond leaders in neighboring states whether in ukraine in other caucasian states or in central asia will have to consider whether the price of freedom and independence is indeed too high
3147314 many players regard the unrest in georgia as a new reason to sell the euro as europe relies heavily on russia for oil supplies
3147315 the market now believes that the us economy once again will be able to leave a crisis behind very quickly the feds flexibility once more is honoured by the market
3147316 where such use would result in a likelihood of confusion
3147317 law as a guide to conduct is reduced to the level of mere futility if it is unknown and unknowable
3147318 only insofar as is necessary to prevent consumer confusion as to who produced the goods and to facilitate differentiation between goods

3147321 not see how a domain name including sucks can ever be confusingly similar to a trademark
3147322 the panel shall conduct the administrative proceeding in such manner as it considers appropriate in accordance with the policy
3147323 give s trademark holders broader rights in cyberspace than they have in the real world
3147324 arbitration means instituting a private jurisdiction by which litigations are withdrawn from the public jurisdictions in order to be resolved by individuals vested for a given case with the powers to judge such litigations
3147325 commercial disputes and their settlement a factor in business planning
3147326 arbitration means instituting a private jurisdiction by which litigations are withdrawn from the public jurisdictions in order to be resolved by individuals vested for a given case with the powers to judge such litigations
3147327 although deriving its effectiveness from the agreement of the parties as set out in the arbitration agreement it arbitration has a jurisdictional nature involving the application of the rules of procedure
3147328 the validity of arbitral adjudication is directly dependent upon the recognition by the legal system that the arbitral process responds to the felt needs of society
3147329 core legal body within the united nations system in the field of international law with a mandate to coordinate legal activities in this field in order to avoid duplication of effort and to promote efficiency consistency and coherence in the unification and harmonization of international trade law

3147340 as oil fell to a 14 week low below 114 dollars per barrel
3147341 the market ignored escalating fighting between russia and georgia oil fell on signs of slowing economic growth
3147342 the end result was not as strong as it could have been however as the stock market gave up half its advance in afternoon trade as crude prices recovered some losses and the fed federal reserve said that lending standards have tightened
3147343 the combination of the big drop in crude oil futures prices a huge rally in the dollar and stability in the credit derivatives market provides strong evidence that most of the major problems eroding investor confidence and driving stock prices lower are finally on an upward track
3147344 and then there was light we need each other lets face the facts here even these cartoons know the deal im totes gonna hammer yr face in when yr asleep
3147345 i risk not producing exactly the same safe product again and again this gets the creative urge going in me this feeling of the unexpected
3147346 i am seldom satisfied with a finished piece this i believe is necessary if not i would be finished as a creator empty of ideas i am always trying to make my work better it is like a mania always better a little different i never say no to a job even if i am not sure when i accept the work how i will create it
3147347 as long as there are clients and i have health i would not like to stop working
3147348 it really is a life style you will not succeed if you only look at clay as a job it has to be something you enjoy
3147349 they have helped immensely in the baghdad area in particular to take down the al qaeda car bomb networks and other al qaeda operations in iraqs capital city so they have done a phenomenal job in that regard
3147350 they have exceptional initiative exceptional skill exceptional courage and i think exceptional savvy i cant say enough about how impressive they are in thinking on their feet
3147351 there were iraqi accommodations in basra there were coalition accommodations in basra there were deals
3147352 i was very upfront about that in fact when i came through london on the way home from congress in september and noted that thats how you end these kinds of endeavours sometimes the deals work out well and sometimes they dont and when they dont then you have to go back and rectify the situation
3147353 there is no question that the militia criminality and violence in basra had reached intolerable levels thats why prime minister maliki ordered the operation there
3147354 the early days there were dicey there is no question about it and it was an urban combat zone it was a fight
3147355 and once again i have reiterated the importance that we put on the british contribution
3147356 everyone is watching and waiting right now to see if in fact iran is going to continue to together with help from lebanese hezbollah train equip and fund organisations that are a destabilising force in iraq
3147357 every situation has its own context its own circumstances and the key of course is an accurate and nuanced understanding of the conditions of the situation and the crafting of an approach that is appropriate for that context
3147358 we have to work with our colleagues our partners in pakistan as well as those in afghanistan in trying to graft a comprehensive approach for the entire region or that sub region
3147359 we are very actively analysing the situation and our various options
3147360 we think that both candidates having seen iraq recently have seen the progress that has been made are aware of the both the steps forward and the additional steps that need to be taken
3147361 but again i would still be cautious of my assessment
3147362 who dares wins and they have exceptional initiative exceptional skill exceptional courage and i think just exceptional savvy i cant say enough about them actually about how impressive they are in just thinking on their feet
3147363 we have had many many cases of very important operations they have helped immensely in the baghdad area in particular to take down the al qaeda car bomb networks and other al qaeda operations in iraqs capital city so they have done a phenomenal job in that regard
3147364 there were iraqi accommodations in basra there were coalition accommodations in basra there were deals i was very up front about that in fact when i came through london on the way home from congress in september and noted that thats how you end these kinds of endeavours sometimes the deals work out well and sometimes they dont and when they dont then you have to go back and rectify the situation
3147365 it is an opinion that is still being formulated we are very actively analysing the situation and our various options we are working that pretty intensively we have been reviewing options for several months assessing what the best options are and trying to refine a recommendation to make at an appropriate moment
3147366 the biggest lesson that weve all relearnt and i think we relearn it periodically is that every situation is unique every situation has its own context its own circumstances and the key of course is an accurate and nuanced understanding of the conditions of the situation and then the crafting of an approach that is appropriate for that context within iraq for example what works in ramadi may not work in baquba you have to constantly assess and learn and adapt that approach first of all has to inform what we are doing in afghanistan
3147367 but the democratic presidential candidate has adopted a key component of bushs fiscal policy a novel bookkeeping method that guarantees that the 9 5 trillion national debt will get much bigger
3147368 the more important issue is whether the mccain and obama plans are sound tax policy mccains tax proposals in general would promote economic growth and provide broad based benefits by contrast obamas tax proposals embrace economic micromanagment and would add further discrimination to the tax code meaning that his proposed narrow breaks would treat americans differently based on social engineering criteria established by the government further obamas proposals would increase marginal tax rates on individuals and businesses the single most damaging change that could be made to a tax system on tax policy the differences between the candidates are stark
3147369 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
3147370 ba aa would have a combination of high frequencies and a transatlantic network that could not be replicated by any other airline alliance and which would make it impossible for other carriers to compete for time sensitive corporate or business travellers
3147371 they were also worried about the fluctuating global oil and raw material prices and stock market turbulence
3147372 the slowdown in other economies has weakened the demand for chinese products
3147373 meanwhile the value of imports has jumped on surging international commodities prices even if the volume may have remained roughly the same
3147374 clearly policymakers have come to a conclusion that their focus will shift from simply curbing inflation in the previous months to both containing inflation and maintaining fast economic growth
3147375 the producer price index rose quite fast which poses a rather big threat
3147376 the interest rate will definitely have to be raised although china is trying to delay the next hike
3147377 its like you build a dam to fend off inflation but it will collapse when the problem gets too big

3147385 vehicle emissions contribute 60 to 70 per cent of air pollution in beijing and these pollutants usually stay in the air for three to four days
3147386 if air pollution is to reach an alarming level often triggered by extreme weather conditions such as high temperatures high humidity and no wind emergency plans will start including pulling more cars off road or shutting down more factories
3147387 about 70 per cent of the devices used in the monitoring network were developed domestically including the equipment that measures pollutants such as nitric oxide carbon monoxide methane ammonia and vocs
3147388 we do not lack talents or technology but policy support
3147389 when the chinese undertake this enormous change in their emissions it will send a signal to the united states that the control of air pollution in one part of the world can in fact affect the atmosphere on the other side of the globe

3147393 these results show its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
3147394 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
3147395 it is always gratifying to see one of the nci designated cancer centers achieve comprehensive status recognition of excellence not only in state of the art care and cancer research but also in patient education community outreach and the dissemination of vital information to professionals and the public
3147396 these extra efforts to establish programs that reach out to surrounding communities and patients are the hallmarks of our comprehensive centers which now number 41 this enhanced designation is a timely recognition of important contributions and advances made by the dedicated staff of st jude
3147397 being designated a comprehensive cancer center is a prestigious accomplishment and to be the only pediatric center is an incomparable distinction for st jude
3147398 st jude is well known for having innovative programs led by the best and the brightest faculty and staff now being awarded comprehensive stature places an additional nci imprimatur on st jude and further validates our position among the countrys leading cancer centers this also speaks volumes about dr kastans strong leadership as our cancer center director
3147399 its rewarding to see a designation of comprehensive to an institution that is exclusively focused on children
3147400 they have a huge population of survivors that they alone have the resources and capability to bring back for follow up studies so they are to be congratulated and envied in that they are the only uniquely pediatric cancer center in the country
3147401 our international outreach program directed by dr raul ribeiro is a wonderful example of how a medical institution can provide important services to local national and worldwide communities
3147402 in addition to the effective web based efforts st jude has a long and successful track record of bringing modern medicine to less advantaged countries through education of local health care providers and establishment of pediatric cancer clinics
3147403 while maintaining significant activities in education and community service st jude will continue its major efforts in both basic laboratory research and clinical investigation to better understand the biology of cancer and develop novel treatment approaches
3147404 sadly i found more of the same subterfuge and insulting pabulum
3147405 students who are forced to leave the ship are never disembarked in unsafe locations
3147406 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3147407 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3147408 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3147409 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3147410 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3147411 just so you all know we did set a record
3147412 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3147413 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3147414 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3147415 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3147416 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3147417 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3147418 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3147419 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3147420 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3147421 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3147422 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3147423 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3147424 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3147425 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3147426 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3147427 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3147428 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3147429 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis

3147437 eu at gostaria que as condi es tivessem permitido que o filme fosse lan ado antes mas creio que o processo todo foi importante para amadurecimento da obra al m disso a m sica brasileira muito vasta e abre possibilidades de se contar muitas hist rias e neste caso temos um olhar sobre pessoas que n o eram t o c lebres e acho que p blico que viu esses filmes que eu adoro vai se interessar pelo nosso tamb m
3147438 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3147439 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3147440 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3147441 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3147442 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon

3147444 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3147445 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3147446 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3147447 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3147448 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3147449 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3147450 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3147451 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3147452 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3147453 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3147454 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3147455 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3147456 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3147457 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3147458 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3147459 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3147460 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3147461 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3147462 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3147463 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3147464 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3147465 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3147466 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3147467 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3147468 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3147469 before john mccains tour of duty in vietnam he married carol shepp a model from philadelphia on his 23rd bombing mission over north vietnam in 1967 mccain was shot down and captured
3147470 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
3147471 in 1979 at a military reception in honolulu mccain met cindy hensley an attractive 25 year old woman from a very wealthy politically connected arizona family cindys father jim founded the hensley and company the nations third largest anheuser busch distributor
3147472 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love
3147473 hillary clinton should take on obama in denver on the convention floor whats she got to lose nada
3147474 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
3147475 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
3147476 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
3147477 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
3147478 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
3147479 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
3147480 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
3147481 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
3147482 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
3147483 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
3147484 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3147485 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3147486 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3147487 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3147488 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3147489 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3147490 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3147491 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3147492 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3147493 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3147494 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3147495 empire of debt the rise of an epic financial crisis
3147496 the honest truth is that we have too many people in washington living for today rather than saving for tomorrow
3147497 give americans a good talking to about the countrys sloppy debt habits
3147498 the american people are a lot smarter than people give them credit for

3147500 if a wall streeter is selling you dont want to be buying end of story
3147501 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3147502 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3147503 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3147504 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3147505 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3147506 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3147507 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3147508 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3147509 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3147510 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3147511 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3147512 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3147513 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3147514 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3147515 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3147516 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3147517 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3147518 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3147519 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3147520 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3147521 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3147522 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3147523 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3147524 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3147525 discussing the flaws at a public conference constituted a transmission of a computer program that could harm the fare collection system
3147526 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3147527 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3147528 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3147529 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3147530 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3147531 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3147532 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3147533 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3147534 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3147535 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3147536 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3147537 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3147538 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3147539 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3147540 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3147541 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3147542 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3147543 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3147544 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3147545 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3147546 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3147547 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3147548 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
3147549 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
3147550 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3147551 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3147552 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3147553 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3147554 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3147555 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3147556 arrested this morning on a felony count of domestic violence
3147557 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3147558 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3147559 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3147560 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
3147561 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
3147562 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
3147563 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
3147564 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
3147565 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
3147566 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
3147567 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
3147568 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3147569 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3147570 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3147571 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3147572 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3147573 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3147574 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3147575 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3147576 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3147577 we have cats and dogs we had to put into the kennel i made other arrangements for someone to watch my house we drove up to the airport bags packed ready to go we didnt expect this to happen at all
3147578 im going to try hopefully to get some money back
3147579 but at this point i just figure im out the entire amount its a lot of money
3147580 who knows how many more times in your life you have an opportunity to do something like this
3147581 best life is cabrio drive because the sky is the limit
3147582 to be in prison for 18 years for something you didnt do and then know you are going to walk out of court a free man thats a lot to take in in one day
3147583 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3147584 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3147585 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3147586 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3147587 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3147588 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3147589 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3147590 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3147591 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3147592 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3147593 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3147594 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3147595 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3147596 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3147597 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3147598 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3147599 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3147600 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3147601 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3147602 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3147603 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3147604 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3147605 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3147606 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3147607 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3147608 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3147609 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3147610 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3147611 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3147612 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3147613 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3147614 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3147615 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3147616 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3147617 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3147618 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3147619 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3147620 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3147621 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3147622 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3147623 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3147624 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3147625 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3147626 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3147627 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3147628 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3147629 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3147630 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3147631 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3147632 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3147633 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3147634 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3147635 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3147636 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3147637 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3147638 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3147639 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3147640 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3147641 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3147642 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3147643 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3147644 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3147645 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3147646 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3147647 spitz said the international olympic committee a us television network or fina the international body that governs world swimming should have brought him to the games this year with phelps making a go at his record
3147648 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3147649 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3147650 theme from shaft died sunday at baptist memorial hospital in memphis after he was found collapsed near his treadmill by his family
3147651 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt sic a lot of things to laugh about
3147652 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
3147653 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
3147654 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
3147655 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3147656 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3147657 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3147658 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3147659 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3147660 i hold that a negro is not and never ought to be a citizen of the united states
3147661 we are at that critical and urgent moment if washington continues policies that
3147662 senator obama says if he had been in the u s senate in 2002 he too would have voted in favor of the born alive infant protection act because unlike the illinois bill it included language protecting roe v wade
3147663 said he had opposed the bill because it was poorly drafted and would have threatened the supreme court decision in roe v
3147664 emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are changing the atmosphere in ways that affect the earths climate
3147665 the evidence is incontrovertible global warming is occurring if no mitigating actions are taken significant disruptions in the earths physical and ecological systems social systems security and human health are likely to occur we must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now
3147666 because the complexity of the climate makes accurate prediction difficult the aps urges an enhanced effort to understand the effects of human activity on the earths climate and to provide the technological options for meeting the climate challenge in the near and longer terms the aps also urges governments universities national laboratories and its membership to support policies and actions that will reduce the emission of greenhouse gases
3147667 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3147668 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3147669 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3147670 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3147671 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3147672 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3147673 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3147674 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning

3147676 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3147677 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3147678 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3147679 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3147680 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3147681 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3147682 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3147683 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3147684 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3147685 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3147686 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3147687 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3147688 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3147689 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3147690 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3147691 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3147692 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
3147693 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
3147694 erin was a big tough mountain of a man who enjoyed the outdoors
3147695 he was a true warrior and just the person you would want beside you in a firefight this was his fifth operational tour and his third tour in afghanistan
3147696 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3147697 if we get to a four degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
3147698 we have reached some areas that had been isolated for two days
3147699 we are focusing on finding the people still missing its bad we are afraid they are dead and well have to recover their bodies
3147700 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3147701 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3147702 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3147703 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3147704 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3147705 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3147706 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3147707 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3147708 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3147709 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3147710 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
3147711 the 200m butterfly is never easy so it was not easy but i reserved a little bit of energy for the semifinal
3147712 the aim was just to get through to the semifinals as long as im through im happy
3147713 weve done enough races now and ive got a good feel of the pace im going
3147714 i knew 1 55 1 56 would be enough to get through and thats how it felt i was doing as i was swimming along
3147715 its always a bit risky but if youre planning to get through to the final thats what we knew id have to do save a little bit
3147716 as i turned i saw i was a little bit behind those guys so i knew id have to pick it up a little bit yeah
3147717 what this means in concrete terms is literally thousands of additional graduates
3147718 when you see success starting to appear thats the time to bear down and thats what the board of regents is going to do
3147719 i get caught up in keeping kids in school and making sure that those kids eventually are successful
3147720 its not something you can fix by putting things in the newspaper putting press releases out
3147721 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
3147722 its too expensive to do these kinds of things mergers
3147723 this is not a catalyst for more mergers in the short term
3147724 we think people take political information from all sorts of sources in their daily life
3147725 and for some people oprah is clearly one of them
3147726 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3147727 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3147728 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3147729 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
3147730 what sort of justice system is this when someone can clearly breach parole and not get sent back to prison
3147731 its got to be toughened up these people have got to pay for what theyve done
3147732 para mejorar el resultado sumergir la moto en agua templada a 46
3147733 you wont get to see anybody flaunting their privates here like you did in whites city

3147735 grasshopper in order to be a rocket on the slide you must be like the slug underfoot without friction
3147736 you put your shoulders and your calves down and arch your back to keep your butt off the slide youll go faster
3147737 i can fart and kick up more water than that

3147749 while the boom in construction is fuelling the growth the main demand is from the luxury hotels and multinational corporations mncs that are pushing the momentum in the gulf region
3147750 in recent times however developers are starting to acknowledge the importance of integrating tfm at the earliest stage possible in order to prevent problems before they actually occur and hence tfm companies are now involved in the design stage of construction projects
3147751 in the past key decision makers were generally disinclined to consider total lifecycle costs and chose quick returns on investments and this reflected in the short term duration of tfm contracts this is however changing now and makes our event a timely platform for global tfm providers to seek lucrative contracts in the region

3147781 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3147782 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3147783 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem

3147787 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say

3147796 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
3147797 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
3147798 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
3147799 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing

3147807 i have no problems being picked ninth by the coaches
3147808 we have a team that is very capable of winning some very close matches this season we will rely a lot on our defense and hope to sprinkle in some goals
3147809 it looks like im getting some new toys in a day or two
3147810 after 11 months it looks like ill get some attention
3147811 it was a very hard series and it drained a lot out of us
3147812 i thought the difference was that we had contributions from different players in the series whenever we needed someone to put their hand up they did
3147813 when you play a team like india you need to identify certain individuals and attack them sachin tendulkar is a big part of their batting and they do bank on him rahul dravid and probably sourav ganguly to an extent
3147814 we knew we had to control those guys in the middle because thats where their nucleus is i also think we handled anil kumble well through the series we frustrated him
3147815 then murali would have picked up 40 wickets and wed have still won
3147816 everyone was playing for a win everyone was very positive and result oriented
3147817 this is what test cricket is about its not boring its very entertaining
3147818 i still believe in this test series there were quite a few decisions which we would have been disappointed with in the dressing room
3147819 here people have faced oppression and so are extremely bitter we had to leave our homes behind when we were thrown out of kashmir in 1989 that anger remains intact
3147820 as a muslim and as a lawyer i am convinced that legally i am convinced that this order of revocation is bad because it took more than three years to process this case our law minister beg has given his opinion
3147821 we have been repeatedly asking kashmiris to leave us alone we want to stay with these people we want to stay with the hindus we cant take a stand apart from the educated muslim i am convinced it is legal and jammu people and amarnath shrine board is only requesting temporary shelters during the yatra period so where is communal what is communal in that this i fail to understand

3147858 the burden of policing the tiffany mark appropriately rests with tiffany
3147859 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting the best way to stop counterfeiting is on going collaboration between companies government agencies and law enforcement
3147860 tiffany has failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that ebay deliberately ignored counterfeiting activity of which it was aware rather the evidence establishes that when ebay had general knowledge of counterfeiting on its website it took reasonable steps to investigate and stop that wrongdoing through general anti fraud measures indeed ebay has invested significant financial technological and personnel resources in developing tools to ferret out and eliminate counterfeit goods from its website

3147875 todays presidential election in russia where the installation of dmitriy medvedev as
3147876 mr medvedev has said some hopeful sounding things in the course of his campaign and the job of a new american president will be to test these words to see whether they could mark a new approach in
3147877 but we have to do this with our eyes open
3147878 russia has stirred nationalist feelings against neighboring countries like estonia and georgia repeatedly used oil and natural gas as a
3147879 mr putin has put russia on a path of zero sum competition with the united states and many of our friends and allies he has stifled independent media harassed and jailed political opponents and made elections a depressing formality
3147880 for the past seven years the bush administration has neglected both big problems and big opportunities in our relations with russia
3147881 as president i will be ready to work with russia where our interests intersect fighting terrorism and nuclear proliferation are just two examples but i also want russia to understand what americas priorities are and that we will stand up for them

3147897 whenever goalies talked about where changes needed to be made and where most thought the limits were being stretched it always seemed to come back to the inner knee padding and the inner knees
3147898 the changes will make the goaltender have to work harder to get his knees down on the ice
3147899 now it could stick in your mind oh im vulnerable five hole and you know goalies we all think too much that could have an impact
3147900 sometimes when the goalie went down the calf protector would hit the ice before the pads so you always had room for error if you were a little late on a shot
3147901 we cleaned that area up goalies wont look as boxy some of the companies already have their new ones in and they look really great compared to what they did but theyre not going to look like they did in the 1970s when you could see bernie parents socks

3147917 corrections officers can monitor exactly the whereabouts of an offender at any given moment these are very precise satellite driven devices
3147918 it makes the job of the correctional officer more efficient
3147919 the evidence is that they work unreliably that the technology is not proven and that there are dropout zones where the technology fails
3147920 its the electronic quick fix but so far there have not been a sufficient number of analyses to determine what benefits fall out from this technology
3147921 this type of gimmickry takes away from proven reliable human interventions that are actually evidence based
3147922 offenders are being held more accountable than ever to their court orders
3147923 we have big problems with it because they tout it as being state of the art technology but there have been all kinds of problems
3147924 its nice now to be able to prepare for the final the way we want to prepare
3147925 in athens we were kind of expecting to go straight to the final and we didnt so that kind of threw us off a little we had to do an extra race which we werent used to doing this time weve kept to the script
3147926 its kind of this feeling of youre getting ready for the fight and then its not there
3147927 it was pretty hard to calm down afterwards and last night was pretty restless
3147928 we started to pull away next thing we know australias in our lane
3147929 in 10 years of rowing ive never seen anything like that its just bizarre all of sudden we saw them coming over and they just about hit the back of our boat
3147930 even when something bad happens you still end up on top and thats why we train as hard as we do
3147931 we dont do it just to win by a second on a good day well win by 10 seconds on a moderate day well still win by three or four seconds and on a really crappy day where everything goes wrong well still win
3147932 if youre not under any pressure theres no point in digging into your reserves
3147933 you save those reserves for when they count you want to go in as rested and as focused as you can
3147934 well look at the tape and see the areas that we can improve
3147935 thats what were going to be doing over the next five days sharpening the saw
3147936 the guys i feel that were in athens arent even the same guys anymore
3147937 their athletic ability has gone up to a really high level way higher than they were in athens
3147938 i think with this crew we build momentum as we go in the races
3147939 even if we win here it doesnt change the fact that i came fifth in athens
3147940 ella debe sentir y tiene buenas razones que no necesita ni partidos ni coaliciones para ser candidata
3147941 los colombianos hoy tenemos una gran admiraci n por su coraje reciedumbre porque nunca se dobleg y sali del secuestro pensando y razonando con gran claridad y sentido humano
3147942 no creemos que para una elecci n presidencial valga la pena una opci n simplemente partidista
3147943 vamos tras una coalici n grande con independencia de si el presidente es o no candidato
3147944 ofrecer varias opciones porque en la segunda vuelta electoral de 2010 hay que escoger una con el apoyo de la mayor a de los colombianos y hoy ning n partido tiene con qu aproximarse a eso
3147945 ellos los seguidores de uribe deben tener una conducta irreprochable y pensar de una manera compatible con nuestros principios
3147946 por lo que se puede percibir antes y despu s de su secuestro ella tiene una concepci n de la sociedad colombiana muy distinta de la del presidente
3147947 si hace pol tica ofrecer una alternativa y no una simple continuidad
3147948 los colombianos hoy tenemos una gran admiraci n por su coraje porque nunca se dobleg
3147949 estoy muy halagado con estos resultados y me siento muy complacido con ellos pero actualmente estoy en lo que estoy no estoy pensando en nada diferente a desempe ar mi labor como ministro si el presidente lvaro uribe decide lanzarse para la segunda reelecci n va a contar con todo mi apoyo

3147971 i saw something about it on tv why would russia attack georgia i mean how can russia be allowed to attack one of our states and its so close to us too
3147972 the table is clean now the problems should be fixed and the future panorama should be cleared up
3147973 what happened today is important not only for bolivians but for all latin americans
3147974 i dedicate this victory to all the revolutionaries in the world
3147975 they dont need to do the same elsewhere simply because what is happening in georgia has already driven home the message that what happens in these russian enclaves wherever they are is for russia to determine and no one else
3147976 the message is you do not touch any of them because the russian military is determined to defend them even if it means crossing an international border with their tanks
3147977 absolutely no doubt that one of his key calculations was ukraine
3147978 violence is down to its lowest level since the spring of 2004
3147979 there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
3147980 because of these operations extremists who once terrorized the citizens of these communities have been driven from their strongholds
3147981 was able to walk the streets of sadr city last wednesday
3147982 this operation is iraqi led our forces are playing a supporting role
3147983 the iraqis will continue taking the lead in more military operations across the country
3147984 beginning tomorrow troops deploying to iraq will serve 12 month tours instead of 15 month tours
3147985 this will ease the burden on our forces it will make life easier for our wonderful military families
3147986 the selfish instinct of individual acquisitiveness finds its necessary corrective in the lively feeling of neighbourliness in the clear understanding that that the prosperity of each member of the community depends closely on the prosperity of all and that all depend together on how well or badly the local administration works
3147987 those now living in the extended order gain from not treating one another as neighbours and by applying in their interactions rules of the extended order such as those of several property and contract instead of the rules of solidarity and altruism
3147988 in democracies of the purest form they pursue a method which is contrary to their welfare the reason of which is that they define liberty wrong
3147989 a recent study estimates that current rates of extinction are 211 times the background extinction rate for amphibians and rates would be as high as 25 000 45 000 times greater if all of the currently threatened species go extinct
3147990 will survive the current extinction event on their own or with help
3147991 we can be sure that behind all of these activities is one weedy species homo sapiens which has unwittingly achieved the ability to directly affect its own fate and that of most of the other species on this planet
3147992 it is an intelligent species that potentially has the capability of exercising necessary controls on the direction speed and intensity of factors related to the extinction crisis
3147993 education and changes of political direction take time that we do not have and political leadership to date has been ineffective largely because of so many competing short term demands a primary message from the amphibians other organisms and environments such as the oceans is that little time remains to stave off mass extinctions if it is possible at all
3147994 we need to design nanorectifiers that go with our nanoantennas
3147995 such trends will not be reversed and the biodiversity crisis will not be resolved until nature can rival virtual reality as a source of entertainment intrigue and inspiration
3147996 people keep what they use and increasing bioliteracy would enable more people to find uses for biodiversity demand for ecotourism and perceived existence values would increase and with them biodiversity sustaining revenues
3147997 in a world of stingy appropriations for conservation we have a wonderful academic literature on how to maximize returns on conservation investments but we have spent comparatively little effort figuring out ways to create a world of biodiversity fanatics and conservation voters where conservation resources would presumably flow more freely
3147998 shifts happen they have happened in our lifetimes we all know these terms segregation iron curtain apartheid anthropogenic extinction belongs on that list
3147999 were excited to provide this new and expanded version of monster madness to gamers
3148000 all of the new content combined with co op and multiplayer modes make this a great title that playstation players are sure to enjoy
3148001 on the one hand under all of the scenarios we considered a large number of very common tree species will almost certainly survive habitat losses whether one takes an optimistic or nonoptimistic view of deforestation in the brazilian amazon this is the good news
3148002 the bad news is that large percentages of rare and endemic species will probably go extinct
3148003 we must once again emphasize how important it is to support continuing basic science on tropical forests we urgently need information on the biogeography population sizes comparative life histories and environmental requirements of tropical tree species
3148004 ever since charles darwins discovery of giant ground sloth remains in south america debate has ensued about the cause of early extinction of the worlds megafauna
3148005 now 150 years on from the publication of darwins seminal work the origin of species the argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
3148006 the tasmanian results echo those on mainland australia putting humans squarely back in the frame as the driving force behind megafaunal extinction
3148007 a study looking into the extinction of australias prehistoric animals has dispelled scientific beliefs that climate change drove their disappearance the first findings of the study suggests overhunting by humans delivered the final blow to tasmanias giant prehistoric animals known as megafauna the discovery was made by a team of australian and british experts including professor richard roberts and dr zenobia jacobs from wollongong universitys school of earth and environmental sciences contrary to assumptions mass extinction was caused by climate change or some other form of human impact the new study suggests no dramatic change in the tasmanian climate at the time

3148054 with the strategic decision to sell our only phase i clinic in june we will be able to focus on continuing operations and to stress profitable operations while the current quarter had a slight decrease in net income from continuing operations compared to a very strong quarter in the same period last year our nine month results showed a 38 increase in pre tax income from continuing operations compared to last year we also increased our cash flow from continuing operations for the nine month period from 3 4 million to 4 1 million we are very encouraged by these results from our continuing operations

3148077 weve done things right by laying the infrastructure first building the rest is the easy bit
3148078 we work from the middle out and we have all the infrastructure in place now and the contractors are moving in to start construction building the towers can be done quickly but the complicated part is placing the pylons which is time consuming it takes at the most a week to put a floor on a tower
3148079 we have the natural history museum of london on board along with kokoro creations from japan dr jack horner the real life inspiration for the book jurassic park and artistic director yves pepin who is currently working on the beijing olympics so all these countries will be interested to learn how they are getting on here

3148116 nearly every car dealership saw sales sink particularly those selling trucks and suvs that have fallen out of favor with consumers as gas prices soared past 4 a gallon
3148117 home builders many of whom expected 2007 would be a rebound year endured another wrenching stretch of stagnant sales and delayed projects
3148118 the combination of stagnant wages and rising food and gas prices has taken a toll on the previously impervious consumer
3148119 home builders are one sector of the economy clearly suffering revenues at the countys largest home builder christopherson homes were chopped in half as the company dramatically reduced the pace of construction around the state
3148120 the company which generated 178 million in revenues in 2006 saw its sales fall to 89 million last year the drop was accompanied by deep staff cuts
3148121 in the last recession which followed the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the tech bust businesses pulled back on capital spending but consumers charged ahead pushing up housing prices while showing little fear of adding new debt
3148122 despite predictions that the housing market is unlikely to turn around until next year christopherson is moving forward with a new phase of its ragle ranch subdivision near the sonoma county fairgrounds in santa rosa the chaparral project will include 138 homes selling in the low 700 000s
3148123 the recession was largely triggered by the crumbling real estate sector the countys median home price has fallen 29 percent since peaking in late 2005
3148124 the recession could end by spring 2009 if the real estate market hits bottom this fall but that would mean foreclosures stop growing the number of new homes on the market begins to slow and more buyers step forward eyler said
3148125 if that happens the end of 2009 and 2010 would look really good
3148126 the worst case scenario is that the housing market continues its tumble gas climbs to 7 a gallon and inflation continues to raise the price of everything from a stapler to a pot roast
3148127 the ssu forecast punctuates a week of bad economic news last week oil prices soared to an unprecedented 142 99 a barrel while blue chip stocks tumbled to their lowest level in almost two years the dow jones industrial average is now down 20 percent from its record high in october a trend traditionally viewed as the threshold of a bear market
3148128 the 1991 recession sliced 900 jobs from the countys total employment although the economy continued to grow slightly
3148129 in 2001 it was much worse the county shed 7 600 jobs and its economic output contracted by 12 percent
3148130 the recent expansion was driven by low interest rates and cheap money
3148131 wages are expected to continue to decline in real terms through 2010 as higher costs for groceries gas and other goods result in paychecks falling shorter in two years people will be making an average 6 7 percent less than at the beginning of the decade according to the ssu forecast
3148132 and then there is the housing market now a source of pain at some point prices will fall to a level sustained by local wages and by outsiders who want a home in wine country
3148133 the wine industry remains strong and has been boosted by exports that have increased due to the weak dollar
3148134 how could americans not be in a grumpy even fearful mood every day they are faced with news of plummeting house prices and a collapse in home construction which created a third of all new jobs in the past few years
3148135 bank failures are becoming more common then theres the rapid decline of the u s auto industry not unrelated to rising oil prices which are also curtailing the dream of the suburban lifestyle and millions of americans are starting to fear losing their jobs and the family healthcare that goes with them the american imagination is haunted by the great depression of the 30s
3148136 the fate of the u s economy now hangs in the balance on one side of the high wire is an inflation risk that can beget a wage price spiral that would in turn induce a powerful contraction by the fed on the other side is an economy getting weaker provoking bank and housing defaults that put further downward pressure on growth
3148137 house prices the strategic fault line have plummeted for most of the 68 percent of american families who own one they are falling at an accelerating rate while inventories of unsold and foreclosed homes are rising
3148138 just a few weeks ago a major mortgage lender in california failed the third largest bank collapse in american history banks are struggling to cope with borrowers who are defaulting in droves on mortgages consumer debt credit cards student loans home equity loans car loans you name it the losses to the financial system are horrific
3148139 with 10 million mortgages exceeding the value of the homes that could take a long time
3148140 only when this huge inventory is cleared from the market and prices start to rise will we know where the bottom was
3148141 in fact the real estate web site says that by its count 77 of homes nationwide have lost value in the past 12 months
3148142 the clerk also believed the suspect had some sort of weapon in the hand not holding the tie

3148187 everybody in this sport takes care of themselves gets massages eats right does all those things a lot of times with pro linemen injuries happen when you are in the wrong place at the wrong time fortunately for me that hasnt happened and i am not going to think about that now
3148188 i was sitting there watching the plays and trying to think through what i do out there think through the footwork
3148189 if you can see little things that can help the other guy out thats part of being a teammate and part of being in our group

3148191 i have all of last year under my belt you have to go out there and earn it i have taken each week and each day of training camp to improve as a player and get better
3148192 i just want to take it one start at a time for now and finish the year strong
3148193 if everything goes well i think in a couple days
3148194 i feel like ive been making good progress every day taking a good step forward each time

3148199 extrapolate these circumstances to the availability of medical services on the two sides and it is clear that even on the doorstep of the global core the medical landscape is anything but flat
3148200 to these and countless others testing the obstacles notions of a flat world remain essentially irrelevant
3148201 one block is a large garden area where people um guys can walk and talk the inside area can hold more than a thousand worshippers theres a mens section and a womens section some people go every day some go to walk in the garden and meditate
3148202 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
3148203 theres going to be a practice this afternoon therell be one tomorrow and well see how it goes ok
3148204 because of the rotation we have right now thats the way it is
3148205 no no decision has been made about the starter im confident we have three guys and were repping them
3148206 im concerned about every aspect of the football team to be honest with you its important we have a good offense we have very good structure but you go through a process to get to where you want to be were going through that process the lack of consistency is what everyone faces its a normal thing
3148207 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson

3148209 nbc has a lot at stake both in terms of the event and a promotional platform for a new television season
3148210 i would think if i were nbc right now id be very pleased its still early but judging off these ratings theyre in very good shape
3148211 they have a lot of big commitments to huge advertisers what else were they going to do
3148212 i dont think there is a corporate halo that carries over because i liked the olympics on nbc i will watch nbc programming i dont think it works that way
3148213 but when they run the promotions on the fall lineup nbc will obviously have the competitive edge against the other networks
3148214 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
3148215 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3148216 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3148217 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3148218 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3148219 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3148220 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3148221 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3148222 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3148223 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
3148224 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
3148225 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
3148226 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
3148227 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
3148228 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
3148229 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
3148230 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
3148231 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
3148232 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
3148233 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
3148234 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
3148235 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness

3148244 the two pit stops in the feature race have proved to be the really high pressure points of the events we felt an additional one would not only add another variable into the sprint race mix but also give the crews another opportunity to display their team work
3148245 when we sat down to discuss ways of improving the series from every viewpoint this was a popular addition however we have also made other changes that will give the teams greater flexibility in certain areas

3148264 trans1 is fortunate to add a director of paul laviolettes stature not only does paul bring vast operating experience to the trans1 board he has been influential in transforming the standard of care to minimally invasive procedures in several markets including cardiology gynecology and urology
3148265 i think the axialif system and the transacral approach to the spine offer the potential to revolutionize the minimally invasive approach to treat patients with degenerative disc disease
3148266 i am very pleased to join the board and help the trans1 team grow this important fusion and motion preserving platform
3148267 started this program because of years of chronic jail overcrowding
3148268 what were doing again is addressing a group of minor offenders whove been thumbing their nose at the criminal justice system for a long time
3148269 if i were the companies i would be issuing public disclosures five nanoseconds after the indictments were announced
3148270 if not there could be big checks the companies will have to be writing
3148271 telling the public that theyve been breached is embarrassing for them it makes them suffer a loss of goodwill and in the case of public companies the stock price goes down
3148272 we believe the credit card information was coming out of an officemax in north carolina
3148273 ongoing federal investigation involving legitimate debit card use at various retailers that was later tied to fraudulent transactions outside the u s
3148274 we have no knowledge of a security breach at officemax
3148275 it would be inappropriate to express our views relating to an ongoing criminal investigation
3148276 for the purpose of downloading credit card information of customers of forever 21
3148277 because we couldnt find any definite information that wed been breached
3148278 because there is no way for us to identify customers who might have been affected
3148279 the consumer always does have an opportunity to report fraudulent activities
3148280 had not received inquiries from credit card companies or customers about these alleged activities
3148281 the georgian army is retreating to defend the capital the government is urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of georgia

3148284 in a very detailed report delivered to president bush just two days ago canada outlines many of the symptoms that led them to this diagnosis the following are some of the many examples that have now been made clear by the report
3148285 75 to 85 percent of america is currently experiencing hot flashes hot flashes are a sudden feeling of warmth or heat that spread quickly from city to city creating flushing redness that is particularly noticeable in urban areas these hot flashes can be a roller coaster ride as some cities will experience the night time version of hot flashes known as the bitch night sweats
3148286 george w bush this seemed to point us directly toward menopause silly no one else saw this symptom
3148287 america is currently in a debilitating emotional state she feels that everyone is out to get her the world is the enemy blah blah blah america just needs to calm down the world can be a good place
3148288 even just a few years ago america would see only two maybe three hurricanes per year today she has tidal waves rising sea levels and dozens of unexpected hurricanes
3148289 the tetons have been swollen for months now this also occurred during the baby boom
3148290 this although not noticeable to most americans has been on canadas radar for some time over the last several decades america has undergone a change for the worse with the jet stream being responsible for an overpowering downwind effect on canada countries shouldnt smell like racism and cinnamon

3148299 it sure is marv the precision with which he hit those notes is a testament to the hard work and dedication that this symphony orchestra has put in over the past 6 months all waiting for this big night in a moment the violins will enter signifying how life must go on even in the midst of sadness and tragedy but right now we have to break for a commercial well be right back

3148302 not like the writers and producers at motown or quincy jones but he was on that level in my opinion
3148303 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3148304 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3148305 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3148306 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3148307 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3148308 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3148309 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3148310 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3148311 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3148312 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator
3148313 i tried to be as real as i possibly could

3148316 i like to use metaphors thats right and take it slow and easy and then build its kind of like foreplay you dont want to get there too soon else its all over its like eating candy just gobbling it down and then i want some more and its gone you have to savor it

3148339 il piano strutturale non soltanto un nuovo piano regolatore ha spiegato lassessore ma uno strumento di programmazione e di indicazione degli obiettivi strategici della citt per i prossimi 15 20 anni lobiettivo duplice da un lato definire un quadro di riferimento e delle certezze dallaltro introdurre nelle procedure dellurbanistica una maggiore capacit di seguire le modifiche delle esigenze della citt dei cittadini e delle attivit economiche lapprovazione di oggi un passaggio importante perch il frutto di un grande lavoro effettuato dagli uffici in questi mesi in cui sono state esaminate le 231 osservazioni presentate 212 entro i termini e 19 fuori dai termini dai cittadini al piano e a tutte stata fornita una risposta inoltre da luglio ad oggi stato portato avanti un lavoro congiunto con la regione toscana per adeguare il documento al piano di indirizzo territoriale approvato allindomani delladozione da parte del consiglio comunale del piano strutturale adesso la parola passa al consiglio comunale cui spetta lesame del piano e la sua definitiva approvazione che ha aggiunto lassessore biagi spero possa avvenire entro lautunno
3148340 nel testo adottato prevista la realizzazione nei prossimi 15 20 anni di 10 000 nuovi alloggi che si aggiungono ai 4 000 gi contenuti nel prg vigente di questi soltanto il 25 uno su quattro sar realizzato con costruzioni che andranno ad occupare aree non ancora edificate ha spiegato lassessore biagi ebbene il nuovo testo conferma sostanzialmente questi numeri con un lievissimo incremento ma sposta ancor pi la percentuale degli alloggi da realizzare utilizzando immobili gi presenti per esempio le aree industriali dismesse
3148341 gi oggi abbiamo limitato queste trasformazioni alzando la superficie minima per realizzare residenze dagli iniziali 40 agli attuali 50 metri quadrati ha precisato lassessore biagi con questa regola che viene introdotta nelle norme di salvaguardia e che quindi scatter al momento dellapprovazione definitiva del piano strutturale di fatto blocchiamo questi cambi di destinazioni duso fino allapprovazione del nuovo regolamento urbanistico si tratta di un intervento anche a tutela delle attivit commerciali e produttive esistenti
3148342 in questo modo ha aggiunto lassessore possibile aprire una discussione coinvolgendo anche il comune di sesto fiorentino per individuare sulla base di studi tecnici eventuali configurazioni diverse da quella attuale
3148343 nel nuovo testo non contenuta nessuna previsione relativamente ad una eventuale localizzazione dellimpianto nellarea di castello ha spiegato lassessore biagi perch una questione che rientra nelle prerogative del consiglio comunale nei prossimi mesi prima dellapprovazione del piano penso che ci sar modo di chiarire la questione comunque ha aggiunto lassessore biagi penso che prima di tutto sia necessario definire la mission dellarea di campo di marte senza lo stadio e poi individuare la localizzazione del nuovo impianto per quanto riguarda la localizzazione penso che se lo stadio deve sorgere sul territorio fiorentino lunica possibilit quella di castello

3148422 australians dont have much respect for the music press it runs counter to their culture australian rock is all about good on ya mate well done for getting up on stage and switching that amplifier on
3148423 the idea of anyone actually daring to criticise musicians for the sound they make is almost heresy
3148424 everyone is treated equally which means no knocking anyone back however great the temptation thatll be why australian rock is best known to the outside world for such musical abominations as silverchair the vines and savage garden
3148425 its a really poor piece of journalism from a music writer who once had relevance and influence but now hes living in australia he doesnt really have the knowledge or experience of the local industry to back up his opinions

3148453 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3148454 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3148455 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3148456 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3148457 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3148458 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3148459 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit

3148485 these expressions are not simply stereotypes intuitively associated with pride and shame but rather may be biologically innate behavioral responses to success and failure
3148486 ekman had established that expressions were the universal products of evolution
3148487 the potentially risky open posture associated with pride and nonhuman primate dominance displays may have originated as a way of conveying the validity of the individuals belief in his her dominance or success
3148488 likely originated as a way of conveying acceptance of an aggressors power thereby removing the need for conflict and sparing resources

3148494 it says were a good team and we find ways to win thats important
3148495 when i first came here that was a focus of mine to try and improve our one run games that means youre able to manufacture that one run you need to win a ballgame and that is key
3148496 we have the confidence to know that the game isnt over until its over
3148497 we have guys that can get big hits and we have pitchers that are able to shut guys down so we feel like the kind of team that can pull off those kinds of wins
3148498 it helps you out to know that by the end of the year you are going to get a lot of extra wins because of it
3148499 because youre playing good games but you just lose by one run it stinks then you go back over the course of the game and you pick out two or three spots when you could have scored that one run and didnt that makes it even worse
3148500 if you win the one run game its over and youre done but if you lose the one run game youre rehashing it nine times in your mind most of the time if you lose a game by five runs the other team beat you but if you lose a game by one run you can go back and find where you beat yourself
3148501 our pitching has been phenomenal theyre the reason weve been doing so well lately
3148502 ever since we got cc sabathia our whole rotation has stepped up and has given the bullpen enough rest so everyone is fresh and can do their job
3148503 youve got to have a good pen to win close games you have to have good defense to do it it means youre a good team
3148504 hes a good pitcher but hes my best shortstop i dont pitch him much but i told him to come out here and be ready to go
3148505 im not usually a pitcher so i wasnt really confident coming into this game
3148506 but my curveball was working and i was throwing everything for strikes
3148507 this was my first year in the rbi program and it felt real good to come here and help my team out
3148508 they showed great energy and character out there they got to the championship game which was the goal so thats fantastic
3148509 im not going to lie it feels great to be able to come out here and win it three years in a row

3148514 confusi n puede ser un buen calificativo para definir los primeros minutos del pandemonium ni se sab a con certeza cu l era el marcador a esas horas de la noche ni si la partida en proceso era la oficial y definitiva o un simulacro eterno como se hab a propuesto en el chat desde la organizaci n del evento

3148523 as the federation of caucasian associations we stress that south ossetia and abkhazia are not breakaway regions they are independent republics their invasion by georgia cannot be accepted just as no invasion in the world can decisions of independence by the people of these countries cannot be rendered null and void through wars south ossetia is currently under invasion by georgia babies are heartlessly being killed there and innocent mothers fathers and the elderly are being lynched
3148524 we want turkey and the rest of the world to recognize these two countries independence as they did for kosovo we call on international democracy and human rights organizations to call for an end to the barbarity in south ossetia
3148525 we have finland up first on august 27th and we are now totally focused on that game but at the end of the day you have to beat them all and we believe we are capable of doing just that
3148526 we have a new coach plus we have managed to get a number of strong corporate sponsorships for this years cup especially from the mining industry such as companies like foraco drilling quantec geoscience and laramide resources inc all of which have business on both sides of the pacific
3148527 this has put the team into a strong financial position and that allows us to bring the best football talent that the ontario australian rules football league and other canadian leagues have to offer

3148569 the truth is that your senior technology officer does not need to be the brightest technical mind in the business except potentially during the startup phase of your company over time he or she need only be geeky enough to challenge the strongest technical minds in your company to add value to technical decision making most often we find that senior executives come to a bad end when they spend too much time relying on their technical brilliance and not enough time cultivating other important aspects of their job

3148578 i launched into a splenetic rage about their cultural ignorance and of course they were furious with me who the hell do i think i am
3148579 it is part of that automatic cultural response in this age of slackers or y generationals or millennials or whatever the f k theyre calling themselves these days not only are they ignorant of everything everything but theyre arrogant about their ignorance they take great pride in not knowing or bestowing geezerdom on anything or anyone who achieved anything prior to their emergence

3148589 a notification scheme gives individuals the information and opportunity to protect themselves against fraud and identity theft
3148590 it also will provide a strong incentive for agencies and organisations to ensure that they secure their databases
3148591 we dont want a situation where all unauthorised access of information will result in a requirement to notify
3148592 instead in our view where the breach can cause a serious harm to an individual is when there should be disclosure serious harm might be information such as a tax file number which can result in identity theft
3148593 we have moved the bar up so that were not looking at trivial breaches
3148594 these days information privacy touches almost every aspect of our daily lives including our medical records and health status our finances and creditworthiness the personal details collected and stored on a multiplicity of public and corporate databases and even the ability to control the display and distribution of our own images

3148618 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgian capital tblisi
3148619 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3148620 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited
3148621 if i should get caught in the rain and rust again i would need the oil can badly
3148622 my head is stuffed with straw you know and that is why i am going to oz to ask him for some brains
3148623 but after all brains are not the best things in the world
3148624 but once i had brains and a heart also so having tried them both i should much rather have a heart
3148625 i will tell you my story and then you will know
3148626 i was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the
3148627 there was one of the munchkin girls who was so beautiful
3148628 this at first seemed a great misfortune for i knew a
3148629 i thought i had beaten the wicked witch then and i worked
3148630 my body shone so brightly in the sun that i felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped for it could not cut me there was only one danger that my joints would rust but i kept an oil can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever i needed it however there came a day when i forgot to do this and being caught in a rainstorm before i thought of the danger my joints had rusted and i was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me it was a terrible thing to undergo but during the year i stood there i had time to think that the greatest loss i had known was the loss of my heart while i was in love i was the happiest man on earth but no one can love who has not a heart and so i am resolved to ask oz to give me one if he does i will go back to the munchkin maiden and marry her
3148631 i shall ask for brains instead of a heart for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one
3148632 for brains do not make one happy and happiness is the best thing in the world

3148652 they had to go in and take the whole vein out i had a vein where the valves werent working i had two blood clots that were in there they had to go in there and take it all out so its all gone
3148653 right now things are so sore and so tight in there that i got to get back on the elliptical and the bike and loosen it up a bit
3148654 varicose veins usually dont bother you but the fact that i had a blood clot in me it flared up real quick
3148655 they dont seem to think its going to bother me too much i think the biggest thing is keeping it stretched out thats probably one thing theyre worried about if i dont do the stuff with it then it will get real tight in there
3148656 its one of those things where if i could be out there today i would be out there today but you dont want to come back too fast because then it could sideline you for even a couple more weeks the plan is to do what the doctors says the timeline right now is two weeks

3148667 the local beach is fantastic its so big loads of space and lots of water sports its great to get up chill on the roof and pop in the pool when it gets to warm
3148668 its lovely to walk around the grounds and sit back on the terrace however the best bit was hiring bikes so we could travel around the local towns and cycle along the promenade as and when it suited us at our own pace you shouldnt miss out on a day trip to cartagena
3148669 i could sunbath the day away in privacy on the sunroof in privacy whilst the kids and my husband were playing in the pool it was easy to pop to the local restaurants or the beach if we were hungary or wanted to do something different but we didnt have to

3148692 in the past few years we have witnessed the popularization of amateur petite and teen content but these things work in patterns cycles
3148693 now its time again to promote the professionals porn stars like tori lane and eva angelina women who really know how to work the angles
3148694 in todays marketplace one cannot afford to undervalue the importance of rebranding
3148695 with illegal tube sites and torrents fundamentally changing the industry having a superior product with the proper marketing is the difference between making a profit and closing up shop
3148696 evotum basically is a video streaming provider with dvd quality
3148697 it allows studios that own their own content to offer it in their own video on demand theaters instead of going through third party applications it gives them the opportunity to take charge of their content while offering customers an experience that is easy and beautiful it takes the online experience to the next level because its almost like watching regular tv its a seamless application with no buffering and it goes through all firewalls people can watch it anywhere at any time all you need is a pc or a mac and an internet connection its the only platform i know of that works on both a pc and mac the system is perfect for adult because it leaves no footprint
3148698 ive seen the video surge the laser disc experiment and i was one of the first people in dvd distribution so ive seen a lot of trends
3148699 its the cutting edge i know its really hard for the old brick and mortar people to understand the internet but theyre really hurting their companies by not getting ready for this next generation of content delivery my job is to go from studio to studio and educate them with the hope that theyll understand how evotum works and why they need to buy into it
3148700 say a guy is online and he doesnt want his wife to know hes watching a porn movie
3148701 he simply has to close it and if she goes back to look at the browser theres no record he ever was there it doesnt even show up on the hard drive
3148702 the system allows companies with content to eliminate the third party vod providers
3148703 evotum allows them to offer their content directly to the customer
3148704 the big vod businesses can offer traffic of course but its time for the old brick and mortar people to understand the dynamics of the internet and start building their own traffic to increase their profits they need to keep in mind also that hotmovies and aebn dont have a drm in place
3148705 the money it takes to have your own evotum platform is pennies in the big picture
3148706 to buy the evotum platform costs roughly about the same as a good web design
3148707 many content providers have the money but wont spend it on this system its a matter of teaching an old dog new tricks in the past big content houses only wrote checks for production now they have to write checks for new delivery methods and theyre apprehensive because they want immediate results they say their dvd sales are still good in certain niches and i believe them but i think theyre selling to an older generation and missing out on the 18 to 25 year old customers who are much more internet savvy they want better viewing experiences and the evotum experience is so brilliant its like having that dvd in your library
3148708 we will offer content houses a free trial to see how their content will look on our platform
3148709 they only need to contact me and we will encode their content and give them free demonstrations we guarantee that their content will look better on our platform
3148710 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3148711 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3148712 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3148713 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3148714 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3148726 kinderen binnen de waarden en normen houden in de bijbel staat hierover in spreuken 12 1 wie tucht liefheeft heeft kennis lief maar wie terechtwijzing haat is dom het woord tucht betekent vanuit de grondvertaling trekken binnen de bijbelse normen en waarden houden dit gebeurt in de praktijk door het goede te benadrukken en te stimuleren maar kan ook door correctie en straf tot stand gebracht moeten worden hebree n 12 11 want alle tucht schijnt op het ogenblik zelf geen vreugde maar smart te brengen doch later brengt zij hun die erdoor geoefend zijn een vreedzame vrucht die bestaat uit gerechtigheid behalve tucht is er ook de barmhartigheid die de bijbel ons leert maar waar van alles geprobeerd is blijft er niets anders over dan tucht toe te passen dit doet pijn bij degenen die tucht ontvangen maar ook bij hen die tucht moeten toepassen
3148727 dit is alleen mogelijk wanneer kinderen in contact worden gebracht met god zelf

3148746 really i thought i was writing about video game lit
3148747 it seems that these works are literature not so much in that literature was ever created to define them as such but because they have bought their place their through the development of a literary basis within the games literature is supposed to make readers think to move readers to engage them these games do exactly that perhaps then that is the argument for them as literature they do what literature is supposed to do and therefore by succeeding in doing defy definition to instead simply become literature through action

3148754 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3148755 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3148756 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3148763 children were tested prior to eating breakfast to get a base measurement then children were either provided a breakfast of kelloggs frosted mini wheats cereal or water next the children were given a series of tests the same tests and measurements as prior to the breakfast each hour for three consecutive hours the results were taken for three hours after breakfast since this is most likely when children may start to feel hungry which may lead to distraction
3148764 a payband personnel system may also include specific staffing classification pay and performance management provisions that differ significantly from the general schedule and or federal wage system
3148765 these distinctions between payband and other positions could be magnified when all of the positions are included in the same rif competitive area
3148766 a separate competitive area for payband positions eliminates the requirement to create position descriptions that must conform to those in another personnel system
3148767 by allowing agencies to treat paybands as separate competitive areas the competitive area is smaller and does not include other grade scales or organizational units and thus there are fewer positions into which rifed employees can bump or retreat
3148768 opm stated that it had no way of knowing how the design of this proposed rule would actually impact employees involved in a rif
3148769 clearly opm has failed to consider the adverse consequences that employees might experience

3148789 i think the reason why bush and cheney are so obstinate about global warming is that theyre both oil men theyre completely wedded to the philosophy that economic activity is a function of energy consumption and since there are no cheap alternatives to oil gas and coal anything that reduces energy consumption must therefore reduce economic growth

3148801 about 16 million in operating expenses will be picked up by taxpayers and each convention has been given 50 million worth of security funding as emergency spending
3148802 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
3148803 in sum the idea that tax cuts pay for themselves sounds too good to be true because it is too good to be true tax cuts lose revenue and when they are deficit financed they can also contribute to poorer economic performance over the long term
3148804 cbo studies show that the tax cuts have been the single largest contributor to the reemergence of substantial budget deficits in recent years
3148805 income tax revenues generally rise and fall with the economy and changes in the level of economic activity explain some of the fluctuation in nominal revenue
3148806 in the following four years that trend reversed and individual income taxes dropped precipitously falling to 7 0 percent of the gdp by 2004 following the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 the lowest level in more than 50 years revenues rebounded in the next three years rising to 8 5 percent of gdp by 2007

3148898 there is a great feeling of sadness not anger we want it to be a peaceful protest we want to show the world that kosovo belongs to serbia
3148899 is there any other nation on earth from whom the great powers are demanding that they give up their identity to give up our brothers in kosovo
3148900 we will not rest until kosovo is again under serbias control
3148901 hitler could not take it away from us and neither will todays western powers
3148902 we are here in support of the serbs who still live in kosovo
3148903 i think the question over whether this capability works has been settled
3148904 the question is what kind of threat how large a threat how sophisticated a threat the us faces
3148905 we provided a lot of information before it took place
3148906 we need to reach out to the serb communities here in kosovo and we are of course in touch with belgrade
3148907 pursuing the unilateral scenario of solving the kosovo problem the european union encourages separatism in the world
3148908 lets be quite honest i think the allegations within this report from our own auditors should lead to the imprisonment of a number of meps i think its embezzlement and fraud on a massive massive scale
3148909 the reality was before 2006 and this report is about pre 2006 the rules were far too lax they have been improved
3148910 spain is not going to recognise this unilateral declaration of independence because it does not consider that this respects international law
3148911 we are talking here of the disruption of all the basic fundamentals of international law in europe which is a result of years of suffering and wars and strife
3148912 it would undermine the basics of security in europe it would inevitably result in a chain reaction in many parts of the world including europe and elsewhere
3148913 both south ossetia and abkhazia have more political and legal grounds for their independence than kosovo we can clearly see a policy of double standards
3148914 china expresses its deep concern about kosovos unilateral declaration of independence
3148915 our consistent position is that we want to develop relations with any free and democratic country
3148916 it is known to all that taiwan as a part of china has no right and qualification at all to make the so called recognition
3148917 i salute the independence of kosovo no people can be forced to live under the rule of another

3149026 anyone whos seen japanese comics cartoon videos or anime art is instantly struck by the common look of the girls big eyes that by making the rest of the face look small add the cuteness and sex appeal prized by many japanese men since no amount of cosmetic surgery will make actual human eyes larger some girls are trying another way to up their cute quotient extra wide contact lenses these are no ordinary contacts theyre not only tinted but tinted prominently in the extra wide outer ring the result is the appearance of a bigger wider iris

3149041 politicians in annapolis are scratching their heads wondering what happened to all those chain smokers who were supposed to help balance marylands budget last year the legislature doubled the cigarette tax to 2 a pack to pay for expanded health care coverage eight months later cigarette sales have plunged 25 and the state is in fiscal distress again a few pols are pretending to be happy that 30 million fewer cigarette packs have been bought in the state so far this year as house majority leader kumar barve put it fewer people smoking is a good thing yes except that maryland may be losing retail sales more than smokers residents of marylands washington suburbs can shop in nearby virginia where the tax is only 30 cents a pack and save at least 15 per carton the maryland pols are so afraid this is true that theyve made it a crime for residents to carry two packs of cigarettes that werent purchased in the state in other words the state says its legal to smoke so long as you use cigarettes that the government can tax and thus become a financial partner in your bad habit but if you dare to buy smokes across state lines you can be fined
3149042 the concept was to create an entire evening of art

3149044 my caricatures are never intentionally mean spirited or exaggerated like what other caricaturists do
3149045 i am fascinated by faces looking at them as shapes and seeing how i can capture them in lines

3149061 i think we have to keep explaining to african leaders the case what we are doing and then they can fulfill their own responsibilities
3149062 i was providing him with some details as to why i am pursuing these cases in sudan
3149063 i believe these massive crimes in darfur cannot be committed without political support so if the african leaders are clear about the crimes they will be very important in stopping the crimes because at the end of the day the victims are african women who are being raped and killed in the camps the victims are african children exposed to conditions that mean they will die
3149064 i believe we have a common goal to stop the crimes
3149065 you can be friends but the law is the law
3149066 those that would trade liberty for security are worthy of neither
3149067 maybe it will encourage people to reflect on what we really should be doing
3149068 what has gotten ignored in this debate is the looming of global warming and the need to end our dependence on fossil fuels

3149071 the initial concept for prey b arf had been incubating for a while waiting for the right opportunity to come along
3149072 we jumped at the chance to create this game with a talented developer like human head studios wait i thought i was doing this on my own and next generation technology like the doom 3 engine game maker 7
3149073 prey is special for many reasons including several new and original gameplay features and a tightly integrated story that packs an emotional punch unlike other first person shooters
3149074 with their help prey is sure to breathe new life into the first person shooter genre with a compelling story innovative gameplay mechanics and dazzling imagery which is powered by our significantly enhanced version of id softwares original doom 3 engine

3149079 oh you dont have to defend yourself to me child i dont care what the other wemmicks think
3149080 no and you shouldnt either who are they to give stars or dots theyre wemmicks just like you what they think doesnt matter punchinello all that matters is what i think and i think you are pretty special
3149081 me special why i cant walk fast i cant jump my paint is peeling why do i matter to you
3149082 i came because i met someone who had no marks
3149083 because she has decided that what i think is more important than what they think the stickers only stick if you let them
3149084 the stickers only stick if they matter to you the more you trust my love the less you care about the stickers
3149085 you will but it will take time youve got a lot of marks for now just come to see me every day and let me remind you how much i care
3149086 you are special because i made you and i dont make mistakes

3149090 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone
3149091 this crisis doesnt directly involve the united states it doesnt directly threaten or involve the united states so i dont think its too great a problem for barack obama to be on vacation right now unless this crisis escalates into something far more serious
3149092 the group of eight highly industrialized states becomes again a club of leading market democracies
3149093 it is always in our interests to engage to listen to build alliances to understand what our interests are and to be fierce in protecting those interests
3149094 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3149095 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3149096 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
3149097 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3149098 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate cease fire
3149099 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
3149100 the situation over the caucasus remains tense and until the conflict is brought to an end the market is likely to continue moving down
3149101 over the past two trading sessions the russian market was severely hit by the military conflict in south ossetia which is currently spreading over a broader territory
3149102 russias involvement in the conflict in the caucasus region caused not only a collapse on the stock market but capital outflow and devaluation of the ruble against the bicurrency basket by around 2 3 in two days
3149103 extremely bad news from the political front has overshadowed russias strong macroeconomic performance
3149104 russia was a safe haven for investors seems to be for the foreseeable future over
3149105 going forward the russian markets will remain under pressure for as long as there is no move toward a resolution of the conflict
3149106 in addition further falls in oil prices could add to the downward pressure on russian assets
3149107 caution is thus clearly warranted in the russian financial markets
3149108 while warfare is never a good thing fundamentally russias economy and infrastructure are not affected
3149109 this vulnerability also means that internally the system is not mature enough to be able to absorb external shocks
3149110 they woke up this weekend and figured out that that ad resonated and they needed to do something about it

3149117 the attack vector is not new but simply a repeat of dans work to a much higher degree of speed
3149118 add s mathematical difficulty of a brute force attempt essentially making the attack take so long that it would be unreasonable to be successful
3149119 for example if in 20 years that secure credit card transaction you made over the internet was hacked it would be rather useless to the attacker
3149120 by adding more randomization in dns just like with cryptography by the time someone breaks in it would be too late anyway
3149121 so far what polyakov has managed to prove is that in a controlled test with highly powerful systems on a fast network dan kaminskys attack vector window still exists and is about 10 hours in length

3149128 we believe a sequential decline in wii sales is possible in july and would indicate a pre holiday inventory build rather than a demand issue we also note that the console appears to be in stock at many overseas retail locations we expect a number of meaningful hardware announcements this fall likely to include price cuts on the xbox 360 and enhancements to handheld systems from sony psp and nintendo ds
3149129 i made a decision on my own without talking to edwards or anybody to try to help them move to a community to try to get away from those folks
3149130 we may never know how much money fred baron spent to cover up the story of john edwards affair but covering up is nothing new for the asbestos lawsuit king
3149131 baron routinely makes huge campaign contributions to groups with names like texas values and public justice to hide the truth from voters that the funding comes from the wealth he acquired as a personal injury trial lawyer

3149140 conventional oceanographic platforms cannot provide observations under the sea ice particularly on the antarctic continental shelf where the most important water mass transformations take place

3149148 the world banks lending record does not match up to zoellicks rhetoric
3149149 the institution is simply not slowing down its significant funding to fossil fuel projects that will emit greenhouse gases for 20 to 40 years
3149150 the mission of the world bank group is to alleviate poverty and one way it does that is to increase access to energy
3149151 the oil industry certainly does not need soft loans from a multilateral poverty reduction agency
3149152 the private sector can do this perfectly well on its own
3149153 the world bank has become very dependent on fossil fuel loans in order to maintain its own financial strength

3149155 ive always felt in any offense or defense throughout the nfl theres way too much volume in a playbook coaches have way too much free time

3149167 but it sets me up for something good the 200 free final thats my first priority
3149168 i just went out i dont want to say i cruised it but i just swam it
3149169 i just wanted to get into the finals and thats all i did it doesnt matter until the finals as long as you have a lane it doesnt matter where you are
3149170 i really thought theres no way and then i changed and i said you know what that is ridiculous this is the olympics and im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts in like five seconds i was thinking all these things i just got a supercharge and took it from there

3149182 argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined
3149183 it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
3149184 it is depressing to see some of the fallout of the fighting in georgia whether it is the heartbreaking realization that no neither the u

3149202 but we have to keep doing that week in week out and now we have to focus on the game at inverness who had a great win at the weekend
3149203 were in with the big boys now and we are determined to enjoy it
3149204 i thought it was an entertaining game and we were great
3149205 to go a goal down in the manner we did and to bounce back against a very good side says a lot about the players

3149210 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
3149211 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me
3149212 i won seven events if they had the 50m freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
3149213 but as soon as the swimming was over and michael phelps didnt break my record every time i went to beach volley they put my face on the volleyballs

3149220 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
3149221 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy
3149222 weve had 35 new competitors coming out of china in the last 18 months

3149225 it is no doubt they are going to register anything that can walk talk and chew gum at the same time so that will give them an advantage
3149226 anyone who they have registered they will then go grab them by them by the back of the scruff and take them out to vote and democrats have always been far superior than republicans in that operation
3149227 i tell people that we have the opportunity to change the world
3149228 it could be very close statewide and if we can pick up 500 votes here and those 500 votes put him over the top with 13 electoral votes and that changes the course of the most important democracy in the world
3149229 we surveyed nearly a million of our subscribers to see if theyve had any problems with the appliances they bought in the last few years
3149230 maytag has been among the less reliable brands in several categories
3149231 maytags service was especially disappointing when technicians come to the house to do repairs
3149232 it was also below average at helping over the phone and through its web site
3149233 my feeling definitely is that most of the country areas will not get the benefits that would flow through to the more populous areas until its virtually at crisis point on each occasion

3149236 obamas plan promises cuts for middle income taxpayers and would increase rates only for persons with family incomes above 250 000 or with individual incomes above 200 000

3149243 i think it was unchivalrous of him to basically say that he wasnt in love with her
3149244 on the other hand the sooner this is all behind us the better
3149245 i was kind of fascinated by her and her friends
3149246 i saw them as a tribe that i wanted to study

3149250 i think that the state department is the proper place to oversee all of the elements of american foreign policy it does not have the authority the resources or the power to be able to play the role as the lead agency in american foreign policy and the congress has not been willing decade in and decade out to give the state department the kind of resources people and authority that it needs to play its proper role in american foreign policy
3149251 we are all meant to shine as children do we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us its not just in some of us its in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others

3149263 its becoming less valuable to be able to predict it and more valuable to be able to adapt thats not to say you dont develop multiple scenarios you do but the point is that the strategic choices you make can be roughly right the real precision comes from your ability to adapt
3149264 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed its the only thing that ever has

3149271 i didnt think it the challenge by distin on ronaldo was a penalty
3149272 i think ronaldo pushed the ball too far and i didnt see anything wrong with the challenge

3149299 hay un tema relacionado con la lectura de libros que creo que vale la pena desarrollar porque implica un h bito que es muy generalizado y sobre el cual que yo sepa muy poco se ha escrito me refiero a la lectura en el retrete
3149300 pero no todos tenemos la fortuna de usted tenemos empleos vamos al trabajo y regresamos de l en tranv as autobuses y metros atestados a duras penas tenemos un minuto que podamos llamar nuestro

3149304 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3149305 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3149306 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3149307 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3149308 did you just say that to get in the house
3149309 er you are looking like a cold bitch better start looking like you care
3149310 as head of house i will institute a system of
3149311 no you dont if you did you would pull over at an accident scene when i was with you so i could watch

3149316 during the late spring and early summer those who plunked
3149317 home sales in bay area crash to 20 year low
3149318 home sales in bay area plunge to 15 year low
3149319 micro or 9 digit micro market association with the eichler home
3149320 it is a bifurcated market with continued brisk sales of homes in desirable neighborhoods especially in the 750 000 and up range
3149321 spring has sprung but home prices are expected to blossom in only a few parts of the region generally west of the bay as inventory remains low and sales number stay slack
3149322 barn burner as yet but a couple of weeks after the super bowl does not a market make the market remains quite balanced as we have about the same number of listings occuring as sales last week 3 new listings and 3 new sales
3149323 appreciation far outpaces income thats why only 12 of the bay area can afford to buy a home
3149324 eichler update helping a midcentury classic fit a 21st century style of living

3149327 people have to understand one thing at the age of eighteen i arrived at a dream club like manchester united
3149328 it was a dream come true but even at that moment i was thinking about playing in england for some years and then going to play in spain even at that time i was thinking that way and i always gave 100 everything
3149329 why lie im not going to be a hypocrite and say the opposite of what i think like some others do
3149330 i said exactly what i thought i have a dream of playing at real and i thought it was time to move on people cant be upset about me fulfilling a childhood dream
3149331 ill be playing at manchester united with my heart and soul
3149332 then you score 42 goals in 47 games one season with real madrid winning la liga as well as scoring their only goal in the european cup final against villarreal
3149333 estoy muy feliz de estar en los ngeles porque es esta ciudad la que me abri las puertas musicalmente en especial le agradezco a los mexicanos viva m xico
3149334 whats even crazier is the states attorney is actually going to prosecute me in court for this
3149335 theyre sniffing along the grass walking on the grass because thats where the dogs want to walk
3149336 if anything i was more surprised with her conduct to continue to allow her dogs to trespass on this property after she had agreed to cease and desist
3149337 from this point forward she began to constantly walk the dogs in our yard
3149338 i would tell her to get the dogs out of the yard always hearing the same responses it is not your yard stating we are harassing her yelling obscenities giving visual obscenities etc
3149339 the dog walking was is an almost every day event

3149354 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3149355 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3149356 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3149357 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3149358 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3149359 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3149360 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3149361 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3149362 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3149363 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3149364 who are open to doing something on the production side
3149365 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3149366 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3149367 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3149368 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3149369 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3149370 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3149371 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3149372 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3149373 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3149374 great 2006 perhaps i can meet and help you next year
3149375 the pace always slows while the public takes a break for the holidays
3149376 the more things change the more they stay the same
3149377 this place to me feels revolutionary much like the early eichler homes must have seemed in their day
3149378 when are you looking at offers and do you have a disclosure package
3149379 you dont get much for a million bucks in silicon valley
3149380 these are people who may have been at the city mission
3149381 this project is a reflection of the partnership and collaboration of multiple organizations in this community
3149382 and that is a commitment to hancock countys vulnerable citizens who suffer from mental illness and or substance abuse
3149383 housing is a fundamental building block for everyone in the community
3149384 if theres a roof over someones head it really gives them a jump start
3149385 this is an exciting moment in the evolution of museum tours the days of the traditional audio guide are numbered and were now able to offer sophisticated multimedia content direct to visitors own mp3 players ipods and mobile phones
3149386 we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3149387 the charge sheet is proceeding along well and it will be pretty heavy i think he will resign and not stand for charges in parliament
3149388 we decided that we will back president musharraf there is no question of him quitting he was elected to a five year term
3149389 good riddance to musharraf but what does it really mean
3149390 people are so focused on finding a scapegoat meanwhile the dollar is at 74 rupees and the price of gas is skyrocketing
3149391 nani has gone through the same process as all the young players and you are looking for that jump up in performance level from the first season
3149392 his maturity should be better as well which is important he is a very young 20 that immaturity showed itself against west ham at the end of the season that has cost us because he is missing for the first two games but when he develops that he will be an outstanding talent he has courage and speed can play with both feet and does not melt in big atmospheres
3149393 if you stop crying and screaming ill give you this map its says its magical
3149394 but you cant do anything bad with the magic especially you cant make children cry

3149406 one of my regulars tried one and then shared a bite with me
3149407 no im not sure whether youre aware of this cash but i have a keen sense of taste and smell
3149408 i guess youd have to or you couldnt create such wonderful recipes
3149409 so ill bet you found something about my cupcake that could be improved with a few tweaks please tell me what i need to change
3149410 no the real issue is that i recognized the recipe
3149411 you mean it was similar to one youve tasted before
3149412 no you didnt you got it out of my recipe book didnt you
3149413 no i got it from him but he just gave it to me i didnt pay him for it
3149414 let me guess you didnt pay him because he was already dead
3149415 okay lady ive tried to be nice ive been honest with you ive apologized you can have the stupid recipe book i dont want it but if you think i had anything to do with navy newcombs death then youre just crazy

3149419 this is a planning took where all things are going
3149420 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
3149421 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
3149422 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
3149423 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
3149424 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
3149425 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
3149426 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
3149427 consulting with our associate greek scholar jan libourel who is an editor for petersen publications
3149428 tribal sovereignty is the backdrop of all of indian affairs of all indian relationships in this country
3149429 people are afraid of that word sovereignty sovereignty is a lot more mundane
3149430 the fact of the matter is that gaming is just like anything else any other subject youre going to cover
3149431 there are going to be good aspects of it there are going to be things that are negative and what youre shooting for as a journalist i would hope is a fair and balanced coverage of the issue
3149432 yes we still do have pockets of severe poverty in the united states
3149433 not every tribe has a good gaming market but it has made a humongous difference

3149471 jesus loves you amp your baby let us help you
3149472 we got testimony from the two escorts who claimed that i was intimidating them to the extent that they were afraid for their lives
3149473 once they were on the stand they testified that i never physically or verbally harmed them or used force in any way against them or anyone else
3149474 my attorney even asked the judge what i was supposed to do when the escorts come up to me and she said told him that i had to back away
3149475 after hearing the escort say that i was nice i thought for sure that the restraining order would be lifted
3149476 how could you keep a restraining order on a guy who is guilty of trying to be cooperative and nice the escorts testified that they were not afraid of me but after hearing all the testimony the judge ruled that the restraining order would stay in place
3149477 its because im pro life its like you know how pro lifers are they say that pro lifers are dangerous its such an explosive issue that they say that they feel uncomfortable but im going to appeal it
3149478 it was probably the most flagrant miscarriage of justice that ive seen in at least 15 years
3149479 its one thing when you have opponents who get up on the stand and lie but we couldnt have asked for a better factual record
3149480 they admitted that he did not threaten them did not touch them they admitted that he never used force or physically obstructed anyone which is what he is charged with
3149481 restraining orders are for crime victims who have been threatened by defendants you have the legal standard you have the evidence and then you have the outrage factor these people admit that they are blocking him yet the court says that not only does he have to stay away from them but he has to back off when they come toward him

3149494 there are a number of potential reasons why proton pump inhibitors might have this effect but we need to do further research to answer those questions
3149495 someone might have very mild heartburn that could easily be managed with other medications such as tums or zantac who are prescribed a proton pump inhibitor
3149496 and then it works but no one ever thinks of stepping down the therapy
3149497 and there are a lot of people we know who arent on these medications
3149498 however there are also people who get prescribed these medications and dont know why there is obviously appropriate use but there is inappropriate overuse and inappropriate underuse
3149499 im comfortable at this point with saying if youre only going to be on this medication a short time dont worry if youre going to be on it a long time the jurys still out as to what you should do
3149500 if youre on one of these medications and think you may be at risk for osteoporosis or you have osteoporosis or youve had a fracture in the past its a good time for you to make an appointment with your doctor to discuss why youre on these medications

3149503 our evidence suggests that the key factor is being outdoors and that it does not matter if that time is spent in having a picnic or in playing sport
3149504 both will protect a childs eyes from growing excessively which is the major cause of myopia
3149505 we have not yet established why being outside is protective
3149506 but a likely candidate is the high levels of light experienced outside compared to inside studies in animals suggest that retinal dopamine is released in response to light and dopamine is known to be able to block eye growth

3149508 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3149509 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3149510 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3149511 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3149512 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3149513 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3149514 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3149515 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3149516 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3149517 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3149518 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3149519 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3149520 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3149521 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3149522 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3149523 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3149524 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3149525 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3149526 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3149527 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3149528 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3149529 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3149530 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3149531 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3149532 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3149533 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3149534 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3149535 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3149536 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

3149539 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3149540 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

3149572 hollywood movies and tv shows such as terminator the sarah connor chronicles have been dismissed as fantastical over the years but this report based on existing research and current technoligcal developments suggests that robots will play a much bigger role in society over the next 75 years than previously anticipated
3149573 these robot developments could be extremely beneficial in the protection of citizens and police in the hands of benevolent governments but in the wrong hands as warned in the terminator the sarah connor chronicles robot law enforcement could be a major blow to individual privacy and basic human rights

3149850 adem s tiene una soberbia muy grande porque est n copando el aparato del estado con gente del partido aprista que comete muchos desaciertos todo esto se va sumando para darle una desaprobaci n muy alta al presidente garc a

3149888 wilderness wildness and wildland are three terms i have used refer to similar places but they mean very different things
3149889 wilderness becomes wildland when it becomes known to us fear is replaced by recognition memory and story
3149890 wildness is the state of being open to the unknown
3149891 t he intent of the wilderness act is to deliberately preserve wildness from humanness
3149892 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3149893 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3149894 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3149895 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3149896 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3149897 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3149898 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

3149927 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3149928 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3149929 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3149930 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3149931 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3149932 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3149933 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3149934 were going to be working with the clubs in order to improve that we want everyone to come to our stadiums behave properly enjoy the experience but dont ruin it for others well be focusing on that
3149935 goodell said he attended a game last year strictly as a fan sitting in two locations along with his teenage niece at a stadium he would not identify he said the experience was different in each location the other in the end zone
3149936 goodell said the fan behavior policy will be in place before the start of the season
3149937 its very possible and likely that people can come to a game and enjoy alcoholic beverages or beer and do it very responsibly
3149938 what we dont want is there to become abusive behavior that includes foul language that includes disrupting other people who are there to enjoy the game
3149939 he tweaked it a little bit in the game did something
3149940 i suppose theres a chance but we havent even talked about it yet
3149941 now look it if you ask matt hell give you the history of his back since he was 11
3149942 bobby is a very important part of what we do offensively

3149944 no way did he think he was going to be in this position six months ago and now here you are
3149945 who knows he might be the starting center on opening day
3149946 now even if i wanted to go a different way you cant mess around because we will have two receivers who are going to be on the roster who will not be playing
3149947 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3149952 quando voltar n o precisa entra na fila fala direto comigo
3149953 i saw this flash on the water and before i could do anything i saw the hull of the other boat followed by this horrendous noise before i knew it i was under water with my boat upside down and on top of me
3149954 i basically said my goodbyes because i thought i was dead when i opened my eyes i could see my boat lights and swam to them and found an air pocket then i dove down and got through the obstructions boat tower and popped up i hung on to my boat and was 400 yards from shore so i started yelling for help and the other boat came back
3149955 one of the fellows in the other boat said he ducked and felt my boat go right over his head were all very lucky to be alive
3149956 judging by what the other driver told me he was running at a fairly high rate of speed and as far as im concerned there were no working lights on that boat
3149957 it doesnt matter how safe you think you are when its that dark at night and other boaters dont have running lights and going at an excess speed its impossible to see them until they are driving over you its really not a good idea to be boating at night on this lake even though you might be doing everything right theres always that other person you have to worry about
3149958 rcmp attempted to arrest a 22 year old kelowna woman for causing a disturbance by fighting this woman who appeared to be very intoxicated was previously asked to leave the area after she was observed impeding traffic on leon avenue by sitting on the roadway
3149959 during the arrest the woman continued to fight with the arresting officer even after being handcuffed while she was escorted to the awaiting transporting police vehicle she kicked the escorting police officer
3149960 this vehicle was stopped at the corner of mill street and water street officers advised the individual that he was under arrest for dangerous driving however he refused to cooperate when asked to exit the vehicle
3149961 at one point pepper spray was used in an attempt to subdue the subject however this did not appear to have any affect on him
3149962 there are half a dozen different locations where the pot growers are dumping equipment and soil and its not just regular potting soil its laced with chemicals and pesticides they dumpers have to use rubber gloves to handle it and then they leave the gloves behind
3149963 not only does this stuff look bad it is not a healthy thing for the wild animals in the area they can get injured by this stuff
3149964 in the fall or early spring during the deer hunting season people are leaving carcasses ive also seen cows dropped off just left to rot or when people have pets die they just drop them off
3149965 if they get into the stream system there are some people in this area who actually take their water supply from the creek they could get really sick even die
3149966 ive seen everything tossed in the woods from kitchen sinks to old refrigerators and sofas its very frustrating
3149967 tree branches are not litter animal parts and carcasses are not litter litter is things like plastic bags and garbage
3149968 the litter act was designed for people throwing things out car windows more than anything if someone drives down the road and tosses a mcdonalds burger wrapper out the window that falls under the litter act i dont think when they made this legislation that it would would deal with people dumping garbage in the woods
3149969 we have to have something to investigate just saying there is someone dumping garbage wont help us depending on whats on our plate on a particular day it may not be a high enough priority to investigate
3149970 we will charge an individual and have in the past if there is sufficient evidence such as a license plate then we have the individual clean it up take it to the dump and bring a receipt to show that they dropped it off after which instead of taking court action we go by the way of writing a ticket the maximum ticket fine is 100
3149971 the cost of cleaning up illegal dump sites on public land is about 17 000 each year
3149972 thats down substantially from where it was about 10 years ago when we had a full time crew working five days a week cleaning up sites now we have a contractor who is responsible for this and basically works one day a week
3149973 this will be an excellent addition to the services we offer our small business community
3149974 bizpal will allow our entrepreneurs a more streamlined and simplified start up process
3149975 the government of canada is pleased to be working with the province of british columbia and the district of peachland to promote a more competitive and productive local economy by providing easy access to essential information and reducing paperwork costs for business
3149976 kelowna reported a total rainfall of 8 5 millimeters there was some intense lightning we were recording a lightning strike across the okanagan every three to five seconds
3149977 there were reports of hail up to 20 millimeters in diameter reported in the penticton area the penticton airport recorded total rainfall of 45 6 millimeters thats a lot of rain to come down in a short amount of time
3149978 on our arrival we found fire in the basement area of the building there was heat damage to the basement area which was used for book storage and an office area and smoke damage to the rest of the building there was no structural damage and only contents were affected
3149979 there was no one occupying the building it was used as a church office building
