450053 engagement services are highly desired by the detainees most of the detainees have had a positive experience with the islamic discussion program and the level 1 education grades 1 3 we have witnessed many of the detainees returning from class and sharing notes and thoughts with their compound members
450054 due to changes in the conduct of detainee operations and programs to prepare detainees for reintegration into society we have not only gone over 10 000 releases but our re internment rate is less than 1 percent

450079 wir k mpften in allen drei sessions um die top3 positionen au er in der letzten runde
450080 nach dem q2 hatten wir uns ein bisschen mehr ausgerechnet aber jeder reifensatz hat sich anders angef hlt und ich hatte nie eine freie runde auf der outlap um die reifen auf temperatur zu bringen
450081 ich bin ganz happy dass wir auf p5 stehen damit haben wir eine gute ausgangsposition f r das rennen
450082 die zeit war ganz okay aber ich habe im ersten sektor viel verloren weil der reifen nicht funktioniert hat vielleicht h tte ich sonst robert kubica schlagen k nnen aber jetzt m ssen wir mit platz 5 zufrieden sein
450083 we really want to try to develop good habits with our players so that we dont have attrition on our squad

450087 wir h tten eine gute chance gehabt in q3 zu gelangen aber ein hydraulikdefekt hat mich daran gehindert die zweite session in angriff zu nehmen
450088 was die reifen angeht wird es auch morgen interessant beide mischungen sind hier sehr weich heute waren die h rteren besser f r mich
450089 ich hatte gehofft dass das so offensichtlich war dass er daf r direkt eine strafe bekommen w rde und ich doch noch in q2 rutschen w rde
450090 sie hatten keinen grip und ich rutschte nur herum hatte kein gef hl f r das auto
450091 ich bin entt uscht obwohl das q3 wohl nicht m glich gewesen w re konnte ich meine q1 zeit im q2 nicht wiederholen
450092 ich bin gl cklich mit p12 im qualifying mir ist auf dem letzten run eine gute runde gelungen wir haben mit dem auto definitiv fortschritte erzielt vor allem die neue hinterradaufh ngung funktioniert sehr gut
450093 sie hat es uns erm glicht uns an diesem wochenende schritt f r schritt nach vorne zu arbeiten
450094 die reifenwahl war eine schwere entscheidung ich dachte dass die weichen reifen um nuancen besser funktionieren also habe ich sie f r den letzten run genutzt
450095 nach einem sehr guten ersten sektor bin ich in kurve 11 zu schnell gewesen und habe mir meine runde ruiniert das hat mir die chance genommen in die zweite session zu kommen
450096 wir hatten darauf gehofft in jene regionen zu kommen die jenson nun erreicht hat wir sind nun im mittelfeld wieder konkurrenzf higer die mechanischen nderungen haben dem handling mehr stabilit t und eine bessere balance gegeben

450106 it is close to impossible to convince countries like australia and england about the security situation here
450107 the security concerns are many and when we have 65 suicide attacks last year so the foreign players are obviously scared of coming to pakistan
450108 i really dont know what to say but the way things are the way foreign teams are constantly talking about the security it seems difficult that the tournament would be held in pakistan
450109 if the government gets involved it might help the pcbs cause
450110 it is all a ploy to reduce the blow for pakistan when they finally shift the event away from here to sri lanka if india takes a strong stand then the icc and the countries not wanting to send their teams to pakistan might come under pressure

450118 it was a classic strategy of giving the president things he doesnt want in bills he has to have
450119 in the eighth year of the presidency and in this environment bushs veto was pretty strong
450120 he had to compromise and he had to do it in two ways either they negotiated out a compromise or he was pushed into a compromise politically because of where the votes were
450121 the president doesnt get involved much with what goes on around here
450122 talking about a second stimulus package right now is premature

450133 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
450134 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
450135 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech

450395 as the homes are foreclosed on then no one pays property taxes
450396 if you dont do this bill to keep homes out of foreclosure the property taxes for everyone else will rise to make up for it the loss of revenue
450397 both prime ministers said we need to overcome these problems and move forward
450398 prime minister gilani said he would conduct an independent investigation into the kabul blast he will discuss the matter with afghan president hamid karzai and will look into the matter
450399 i am meeting president karzai tomorrow if they give me evidence then we will look into the matter
450400 the indian prime minister was relatively frank in expressing his views
450401 in the early stages of this process higher food prices will help millions of farmers who have been scraping along on very poor returns for their effort because political power lies in the cities but later it gets uglier
450402 a lot of the routine stuff we do can be done by really talented people in another time zone at much lower wages
450403 five innovations that will change our lives over the next five years
450404 has one of the most multifaceted business models in the retail sector
450405 the 10 dividend bump is a testament to solid cash flow growth despite difficult economic conditions
450406 what they want to do is put an end to the catholic church but they have not succeeded
450407 they get dressed up as priests conduct baptisms and confirmations all paid for by the government while the people go hungry
450408 nothing remotely like this ever happened in the nine years i was receiving police protection
450409 i simply wish to protect my reputation from a bunch of lies
450410 the falsehoods relating to our client and his friends the various statements that invade their privacy and statements about security precautions that remain in place
450411 what he has done is essentially given a road map for anybody to read who is maliciously inclined
450412 people i respect and admire people who risked their lives to look after me have been defamed in this book
450413 they never drank on duty they never went to the pub they never even accepted drinks when i went to the homes of my friends
450414 it sticks in my throat to see them described as this bunch of drunken vindictive losers
450415 is responding well to treatment and will be released soon
450416 it will be our alaska gas flowing to provide aid to those in the lower 48 who are turning to alaska waiting and wanting alaska to help
450417 the question of power has been settled by the elections
450418 it should be stressed that executive power will remain with the elected president
450419 this council cannot ignore the terrible crimes that have occurred throughout the conflict in darfur
450420 no progress will be possible without the full cooperation of the sudanese government
450421 the question here is who is the bad actor if the u s wants to keep the pressure on bashir they dont want to suggest that somehow he is being unfairly targeted he is not
450422 and i still do i cannot believe this hes a nice guy
450423 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
450424 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
450425 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
450426 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
450427 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
450428 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
450429 its a bonus for anyone like me who didnt know what to do with coins and didnt throw them away
450430 everyone is totally confused maybe things will settle down in a few days its farcical at the moment
450431 the mind is like a parachute it works only when it is open
450432 i came back from kirkuk half an hour ago the situation is very tense there
450433 the kurds want to lay bricks for an independent state but escalating tensions will not bring any good to anyone
450434 why is the peshmerga kurdish militia in the center of kirkuk
450435 kirkuk is a city under the rule of the central government and must remain as it is

450438 the problem we faced within the anglican communion was that bishops gathering for lambeth represent not only their diocese but their participation in the fellowship of worldwide anglican christians where there are bishops whose participation in that worldwide fellowship is for one reason or another questionable that is the reason for questioning their participation
450439 we have got to address the problem we experienced last year by not having a leadership election and a proper debate about the future of the party
450440 gordon brown should welcome that it is not the old politics of john major saying back me or sack me
450441 it is saying here is my politics and my ideology if people have other views let them name themselves and stand and lets have that debate and that leadership election
450442 we could have a leadership election which is open friendly and democratic and involves the whole country
450443 i pay you guys all that money and this is the best you can come up with
450444 would you all stop loving this guy so much please
450445 i still think this is a very very strong team and im still very confident that this is a team that can finish in the top five
450446 the benchmarks for us are finishing in the top five in medals its very hard to be specific in the number of medals because you dont know how many the chinese are going to take from all of us

450450 at the end of the day we just dont know we are in the hands of qantas as to whether these incidents are part of a pattern we should be concerned about we have asked the company for a briefing to tell us whats going on our members are concerned but they are not concerned enough that they wouldnt be prepared to go to work
450451 i think its a tick in the box for qantas because they operate to such high safety standards
450452 the air traffic controllers contacted the pilot when they thought they saw smoke coming from the back of the aircraft
450453 the pilots would have had a warning from the flight management system the pilot decided to return to sydney they flew out over the ocean to dump fuel because they were overweight for landing
450454 about five minutes after taking off it was very obvious the plane was very low in the sky it was very strange
450455 for 45 minutes we did not know what was going on there was an announcement once every 40 minutes the plane circled for about an hour and a half dumping fuel from the plane
450456 the 767 has three independent hydraulic systems on board so that if one springs a leak there are two others to back it up the safety of the aircraft was not at risk
450457 there was no safety issue at any time the qantas group operates more than 330 000 sectors each year and air turnbacks are extremely rare
450458 a member of the hamas police and a member of the ezzedine al qassam brigades the military wing of hamas were martyred
450459 fired mortar rounds at the hamas police as well as a rocket at gaza city
450460 there have been several arrests and there will be many more we have asked the police to be firm
450461 these are lies we never fired rockets or mortar rounds hamas is the one committing crimes we have asked all the palestinian factions islamists and nationalists to use their influence so that these crimes cease
450462 laid siege to our house firing mortar rounds targeting our women and our children
450463 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on earth is adapted paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm
450464 if there is no action before 2012 that is too late what we do in the next two to three years will determine our future this is the defining moment

450475 a clear signal for a mutual freeze we would freeze our sanctions efforts and iran the development of its centrifuges this is a clear offer that deserves a clear answer and soon
450476 we would then have to further increase pressure via sanctions

450483 rafael geh rt zu den besten spielmachern in europa wir haben ein indiskutables angebot von real abgelehnt und mehr gibt es zu diesem thema nicht zu sagen
450484 got so fed up with his attitude that they locked him in a cupboard under the stairs and all went to the local pub for a pint or two when they were suitably refreshed they came back and let him out
450485 at least forty quid a night for special branch officers to risk their lives to stop him being taken out by followers of the fatwa
450486 we were paying or rather the taxpayer was paying rushdie to protect him
450487 he is portraying me as mean nasty tight fisted arrogant and extremely unpleasant in my humble opinion i am none of those things
450488 the simple fact of the matter is that nothing of this sort happened
450489 the idea of them raiding my friends wine cellars then me asking them to pay for this is completely fictitious it is absurd the idea that they would lock me in a cupboard and go to the pub
450490 it is like a bad comedy my relations with the protection officers were cordial and i am still friendly with a few of them at the end of my nine years of protection they held a reception for me i had a lot of sympathy and understanding from the police our relationship was the exact opposite of what has been written i never heard myself called by the name scruffy in nine years
450491 i tried to tell him that having us around hadnt put scruffy off his stroke in the past
450492 i dont even want to dignify that with a response
450493 it is extraordinary to have had to go through an experience as unpleasant as that period of sequestration to have somebody to try to cash in giving a false portrait to a publisher a very senior member of the scotland yard protection service telephoned me to apologise and said the police force felt humiliated and embarrassed
450494 police officers thought if i was incurring costs it would be fair to contribute to that that was an offer made to me by senior officers of special branch it was never a request of mine to say that i was trying to extort money from them for my protection is an obscene distortion of the truth
450495 your conduct serves to increase the risk to him rushdie and to his publisher without the slightest public interest justification i invite you to mitigate the damage you have already done by withdrawing the book and removing the falsehoods relating to our client and his friends the various statements that invade their privacy and statements about security precautions that remain in place
450496 apart from anything else what he has written makes the police look bad the idea that the police would treat somebody they are supposed to protect in this way is very disturbing the idea that i was so unpleasant to them they locked me up is totally made up
450497 this is not a free speech issue this is libel there is a difference between those two things i can defend the truth i will not have my character destroyed and presented to the world as something that it is not i am not trying to prevent him from publishing his stupid book but if they publish it as it is there will be consequences and there will be a libel action
450498 it is not our intention to comment on ron evans recollection and interpretation of specific events we regret that he chooses to publish this book there were a number of passages within the draft which caused us concern following legal advice we negotiated with the publishers to make some alterations
450499 worthy of coming on her triggering fury among women who saw it as a deliberate double entendre
450500 no matter what women achieve some people apparently still see them as sex objects she said
450501 the public response to sam newmans latest outburst shows that most people appreciate how stupid and shallow his comments are
450502 he just wants to attract attention it cant be anything else and i dont think he is going to change she said
450503 it seems as if he is in pursuit of infamy and if thats the case perhaps he should be taken off air people find him offensive and inappropriate
450504 nine management should really pull sam newman in and tell him what is and what isnt appropriate in terms of his role on tv she said
450505 we are a free country and i guess people want sam on television she said its a rough and tumble show but sam went too far
450506 good morning this weekend marks the beginning of august the month when many americans take their summer vacation this year however the high price of gas is taking a toll on summer travelers congress is now taking a month long recess of its own unfortunately democratic leaders are leaving town without taking any action to ease the burden of high gas prices on families across america the fundamental source of high gas prices is the fact that supply is not keeping pace with demand to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home so in june i called on congress to lift the legislative ban that prevents offshore exploration of parts of the outer continental shelf or ocs but the leaders of the democratic congress have refused to allow a vote lifting the ban on this offshore exploration would benefit our economy in two important ways first lifting the ban would allow our nation to take advantage of a large and reliable source of domestic oil experts believe that these restricted areas could eventually produce about 18 billion barrels of oil thats almost 10 years worth of americas current oil production second lifting the ban would create new opportunities for american workers and businesses on tuesday i visited the lincoln electric company in cleveland ohio a business that produces welding products used for offshore exploration if congress were to permit this exploration it would mean new jobs at businesses like lincoln electric american drivers are counting on congress to lift the ban on offshore exploration and so are american workers bringing these resources online will take time and that means that the need for congressional action is urgent ive lifted the executive restrictions on offshore exploration this means that the only thing now standing between the american people and these vast oil resources is the united states congress the sooner congress lifts the ban the sooner we can get this oil from beneath the ocean floor to your gas tank we also need to take other essential steps to strengthen domestic oil production congress needs to pass legislation that allows us to tap the extraordinary potential of oil shale permits exploration in currently restricted areas of northern alaska and enables the expansion of americas domestic refining capacity it appears that the leaders of the democratically controlled congress will let the entire summer pass without voting on any of these vital steps to help reduce pressure on gas prices this failure to act is unacceptable to me and unacceptable to the american people so when they return from their summer break democratic leaders should show that theyve heard the frustration of the american people by allowing a vote on offshore exploration if congress does not act they will owe families across america an explanation for why theyre ignoring their concerns i know that high energy prices are making this a difficult time for many of our citizens but it is important to remember that these high prices were not inevitable they are partially the result of policy choices that have been made over the years by the united states congress now congress has an opportunity to begin reversing that damage by opening up new resources at home we can help bring energy costs down and that will help ensure that our economy remains the strongest most vibrant and most hopeful in the world thank you for listening

450520 to be honest i dont think to this day i will ever in my life do an interview with her
450521 it really affected me and solheim wasnt a time to talk about it
450522 dottie was a family member to me and i dont even see her as a friend any more
450523 i think that it was a really low blow and highly disappointing really because i think that as a golfer you appreciate golf and what we are doing out here it really affected us in our hearts sherri and i thought it was ridiculous really
450524 it was more of a heart thing than anything else we had a team that was there to support us and pull us out of it i dont think sherri or i will ever look at dottie the same

450537 at e3 2008 jack trenton announced a line up of playstation 3 titles that would be getting special treatment and goes into effect this week july 28 2008
450538 we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
450539 i think people for some reason think hes lazy and a bad teammate and that he doesnt care
450540 hes none of the above does he do some goofy things absolutely he does do some goofy things but as far as preparation and knowing the game and wanting to win theres no way you put up those numbers year in and year out unless youre a special talent and work at it and he does both
450541 its nice to see weve done something like this to make a push for the next two months
450542 hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
450543 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
450544 manny being manny can also mean hell hit a lot of home runs and drive in a lot of runs
450545 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
450546 mannys certainly not a simple personality thats for sure hes complex but ive seen him when he competes
450547 ive had some colorful personalities on my clubs like david wells and jimmy leyritz if you feel somebodys going to help your club youve got to find a way to make it work and thats my job its a challenge but i look forward to it
450548 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
450549 i would warmly welcome it if he would stay in the parliament and return to the front bench
450550 it has been a couple of dry rounds so its good to be back
450551 all three of us davison and tander would love to have raced him to the finish i had a flat tyre in 2002 when we were in formula ford and mark won so what goes around comes around
450552 im staying consistent and saying the same thing i have all year im not looking at the championship until after bathurst im just focused on winning races and winning rounds
450553 i was quicker than whincup and tander without the problem so weve got the fastest car on the track its a good feeling knowing they are waiting for something to go wrong to catch up
450554 one should not focus on the deadline too much what matters is that we get a clear answer quickly its not a matter of one day
450555 its unfortunate the iranians have not responded to the p5 1s generous incentives package it just further isolates their country

450606 some players cant cope with those sort of conditions they sweat too much and when that happens they cant perform to the best of their ability
450607 we wanted to make sure that every player we picked can deal with the conditions
450608 tactically we also have something we do which i cant make public
450609 we have to make the field as small as possible we have to be compact in midfield
450610 we go out of our way to encourage people to drive up to the curb
450611 we will fight people for their bags and put them on a free luggage cart
450612 they needed a place to live and they needed a place to work
450613 i do not believe that it is appropriate to use state tourism marketing funds to support any specific social agenda nor would we ever knowingly do so

450622 and jennifer rankines attendance today is a sign of confidence the government will follow up some of the initiatives created by the summit
450623 sometimes i worry about my future because there are not enough people out there to hire you
450624 i really hope something positive comes out of the summit
450625 you drive through some suburbs and there is a pride in that suburb you drive through others and it would be a challenge to drive through them we have to change that perception
450626 it will take money take time and it wont happen tomorrow but its got to start somewhere the summit is a good place to start because it gets people talking what will come out of today is a push about the positives

450628 paul stanley is one of the 7 greatest wonders of the world
450629 here you have a man who knew what he wanted out of life and had the guts and drive to go out and get it while at the same time never forgetting where he came from
450630 paul has accomplished so many things in his life and unbeknownst to him one of them was setting the path for my brother kris and i to follow
450631 yeah he got a kick out of that he said that we could thank him for us being able to own the worlds largest paul stanley collection ive truly never met a nicer guy

450647 herr bsirske soll in der s dsee bleiben wenn er jetzt nicht zur cktritt sollten ihm die gewerkschafter den stuhl vor die t r setzen
450648 das verhalten ist unglaublich ich fordere herrn bsirske auf sein aufsichtsrats mandat bei lufthansa niederzulegen
450649 dass man die n he zum gehobenen management sucht und dazu geh ren will statt das ohr an der basis zu haben

450669 the council has said there might be a problem with getting sound transits money if its not voted on this evening
450670 the proposed alternative was done with the goal of not taking any public property but the purpose of the project is to enhance access to transit
450671 this isnt something that we just decided to enter into over the last month or over the last year
450672 these projects that are funded so heavily by outside agencies are exceedingly rare and if we dont do anything we run the serious risk that we could lose the funding and nothing is done
450673 in the past we havent had good discussion on everything i would encourage the council to be more open in the future
450674 i agree that some parts of this have not been perfect in many ways
450675 but i take offense at the intimation that anybody on this council has ever acted in any subversive way
450676 as a new council member i find it a bit frustrating to be confronted with a situation that might have been avoided if we had a better process

450697 no me dejaron hablar con un abogado en 24 horas no me dijeron de qu se me acusaba
450698 estoy presa por mi trabajo profesional como cineasta por la informaci n que manejo por interactuar con activistas mapuches que luchan por lo que creen por entrevistar a personas de comunidades mapuches que han sido muy reprimidas y que no se atreven a decir nada porque s muchas cosas tan crueles que me llegan a enfermar el pueblo mapuche ha sido humillado ha sido perseguido he visto tanta gente aplastada emocionalmente siqui tricamente tanta gente que no se atreve a hablar por eso estoy presa

450708 nuestros peque os productores agr colas son masacrados por la brutal injusticia del entorno del comercio internacional
450709 en la globalizaci n el campesino o campesina pierde su identidad social cultural y econ mica de productor ahora un campesino es consumidor de semillas y qu micos caros que venden las poderosas corporaciones trasnacionales por medio de poderosos latifundistas y prestamistas locales
450710 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
450711 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
450712 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar
450713 el sector paraestatal continuar a siendo un riesgo para la exitosa implementaci n del presupuesto de 2002 03 las intervenciones del gobierno en la agricultura y otros mercados alimentarios est n socavando otras inversiones m s productivas
450714 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
450715 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
450716 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos

450718 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
450719 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi

451266 more bluntly kilcullen who helped general david petraeus design his 2007 counterinsurgency strategy in iraq called the decision to invade iraq
451267 did not seek to clear that quote with me and i would not have approved it if he had
451268 if he had sought a formal comment i would have told him what i have said publicly before in my view the decision to invade iraq in 2003 was an extremely serious strategic error
451269 but the task of the moment is not to cry over spilt milk rather to help clean it up a task in which the surge the comprehensive counterinsurgency approach and our troops on theground are admirably succeeding

451274 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
451275 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
451276 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003

451282 hal lindsey is largely responsible for the modern fundamentalist christian view of the anti christ as a world leader who can unite the world and bring a temporary peace before the end of the world the very same imagery and sophistry that mccains the one ad plays up so i sincerely doubt it is mere coincidence that the same day mccains campaign puts out an ad with images of barack obama as a messianic figure hal lindsey writes obamas world tour provided a foretaste of the reception he can expect to receive he will probably also stand in some european capital addressing the people of the world and telling them that he is the one that they have been waiting for and he can expect as wildly enthusiastic a greeting as obama got in berlin the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance

451576 john the baptist has pointed out the lamb peter has firmly established his throne paul has prepared the bride their joint work admirable in its unity at once suggests the reason for their feasts occurring almost simultaneously in the cycle the alliance being now secured all three fall into shade whilst the bride herself raised up by them to such loftly heights appears alone before us holding in her hands the sacred cup of the nuptial feast
451577 this gives the key of todays solemnity revealing how its appearance in the heavens of the holy liturgy at this particular season is replete with mystery the church it is true has already made known to the sons of the new covenant in a much more solemn matter the price of the blood that redeemed them its nutritive strength and the adorng homage is its due on good friday earth and heaven beheld all sin drowned in the saving stream whose eternal flood gates at last gave way beneath the combined effort of mans violence and of the love of the divine heart the festival of corpus christi witnessed our prostrate worship before the altars whereon is perpetuated the sacrifice of calvary and where the outpouring of the precious blood affords drink to the humblest little ones as well as to the mightiest potentates of earth lowly bowed in adoration before it
451578 how is it then that holy church is now inviting all christians to hail in a particular manner the stream of life ever gushing from the sacred fount what else can this mean but that the preceding solemnities have by no means exhausted the mystery the peace which this blood has made to reign in the high places as well as in the low the impetus of its wave bearing back the sons of adam from the yawning gulf purified renewed and dazzling white in the radiance of their heavenly apparel the sacred table outspread before them on the waters brink and the chalice brimful of inebriation all this preparation and display would be objectless all these splendours would be incomprehensible if man were not brought to see therein the wooings of a love that could never endure its advances to be outdone by the pretensions of any other therefore the blood of jesus is set before our eyes at this moment as the blood of the testament the pledge of the alliance proposed to us by god exodus 24 8 hebrews 9 20 the dower stipulated by eternal wisdom for this divine union to which he is inviting all men and its consummation in our soul which is being urged forward with such vehemence by the holy ghost
451579 having therefore brethren a confidence in entering into the holies by the blood of christ says the apostle a new and living way which he hath dedicated for through the veil that is to say his flesh let us draw near with a pure heart in fullness of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with clean water let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering for he is faithful that hath promised
451580 nor must we omit to mention here that this feast is a monument of one of the most brilliant victories of holy church in our own age blessed pope pius ix had been driven out from rome in november 1848 by the triumphant revolution but the following year just about this season his power was re established under the aegis of the apostles on june 28 and the two following days the eldest daughter of the church a former nickname for france faithful to her past glories swept the ramparts of the eternal city and on july 2 marys festival the feast of the visitation on the traditional calendar the victory was completed not long after this a twofold decree notified to the city and the world the pontiffs gratitude and the way in which he intended to perpetuate in the sacred liturgy the memory of these events

451590 la poca por no decir nula actividad parlamentaria del cabeza de lista del pp por castell n juan costa ha obligado al n mero dos del ppcv a desistir de pilotar como lo hace habitualmente la comparecencia de un grupo de parlamentario del pp para enjuiciar los 100 d as de gobierno

451602 este mismo vac o de concreciones ha regido cuestiones tan importantes como la propuesta del gobierno en materia de financiaci n auton mica presentada al consejo de pol tica fiscal y financiera una bater a de propuestas con la que no se puede estar de acuerdo ni en desacuerdo porque se trata de ideas tan gen ricas y ambiguas que es imposible sacar una conclusi n clara respecto a las mismas
451603 la consecuencia de esta anarqu a gestora es la par lisis del pa s
451604 estamos en una situaci n en la que no sabemos a qu atenernos con la financiaci n auton mica con la gesti n de los aeropuertos con la pol tica h drica y en definitiva con tantas materias que afectan directamente al ciudadano
451605 lo que tenemos en espa a es un gobierno central que desgobierna que toma decisiones imprecisas a golpe de titular que trata de decir a todo el mundo lo que quiere o r porque no tiene ni idea de lo que quiere hacer y que de seguir as va a dejar a nuestro pa s en el siglo xx y a convertirlo en el furg n de cola de europa en lugar de en el motor en el que se hab a convertido con el gobierno del partido popular

451642 drilling is out of the question because cheaper oil is not worth the possibility of damaging our precious landscapes or wildlife and we need to cut fossil fuel use because of global warming and high gas prices are the best thing to make that happen
451643 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
451644 but the u s energy information administration an independent statistical agency within the department of energy concluded that new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
451645 but lets say that is true what good is wind or solar going to be in that time frame to power cars you could say electric cars but not in this time frame you cannot replace the hundreds of millions of gas powered cars in the u s within this time frame can you explain what is going to happen to the batteries from the hundreds of millions of cars when they wear out
451646 replacing hundreds of millions of gas power cars within this time frame
451647 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
451648 do you think oil companies would sell oil to us consumers for one cent less than they could get from french consumers no where oil comes from has no effect on price
451649 then there are the distribution concerns and as youve mentioned battery concerns as it is well known that these batteries are every bit as bad for the environment as our other resources
451650 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
451651 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
451652 then you say in 30 years gas will be 12 a gallon if this drilling will not effect the price of oil dont you think gas will not increase more than 2 a gallon over a 15 20 year period
451653 as for car batteries let me clear up my statement i was talking about the batteries that will be in electric cars have you thought about how to dispose of those
451654 as for you so called correction about transmission lines going to the
451655 does it not matter to you that gas produced in america will keep the u
451656 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
451657 looks like the dems would rather go on a five week vacation than debate what to do about the price of gas
451658 new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
451659 i assume this would also be true for ocs oil

451691 de producent van de belgica mosselen heeft een overeenkomst tot zelfcontrole ondertekend met het voedselagentschap het is dus volkomen normaal dat de giftige toxine werd ontdekt na een eigen controle van de kweker
451692 test aankoop blijkt niet op de hoogte van onze procedures
451693 de producent heeft met ons een overeenkomst getekend die stipuleert dat hij regelmatig stalen moet nemen en die naar een onafhankelijk lab moet sturen die staalname begint al enkele maanden voor de eerste oogst
451694 wij werden in de vooravond verwittigd en de kweker heeft onmiddellijk zijn verantwoordelijkheid genomen
451695 een staal dat vandaag wordt genomen kan al een volledig ander beeld geven
451696 nu volgt een periode van verhoogde staalname en als alles positief is kan de mosselkweker zonder probleem opnieuw oogsten

451703 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
451704 what i dont want to do is for the best to be the enemy of the good
451705 and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then thats something im open to

451734 is this going to result in a kind of blessed censorship of a whole host of areas of medical care and research
451735 that would deny federal funding to any hospital clinic health plan or other entity that does not accommodate employees who want to opt out of participating in care that runs counter to their personal convictions including providing birth control pills iuds and the plan b emergency contraceptive

451748 i was under deep cover for most of my career so to use my real name might expose people ive met
451749 decent interval an insiders account of saigons indecent end told by the cias chief strategy analyst in vietnam
451750 i sent it to them more than a year ago and i said please tell me what you want taken out of this or re written repeatedly but they disapproved all of it with the exception of a few sentences they approved maybe one percent of the book
451751 if the cia argues he exposed state secrets they could go after him on a criminal basis
451752 its been a constant promise to congress since i joined in the 1980s that were going to get out of the embassies it didnt mean into the united states
451753 the billions given to the agency after 9 11 to get case officers out of the embassies were intended to put them overseas
451754 and what theyre doing is hiring a lot of people putting them in training for a very long time and then theyre stacking them up in u s offices
451755 we probably had more case officers in california than we did in iraq
451756 whats happened is the cia has spent more than 3 billion specifically on fielding officers outside of embassies
451757 but has been unable to field a single additional effective officers overseas
451758 they were working hard and they meant well but most of them didnt need to be there i thought we were creating a huge number of people there so we could tell congress we had x number of people stationed in iraq but most of them were support
451759 less than 15 percent of the employees we had in iraq were case officers
451760 meaning that less than 15 percent were qualified to gather intelligence the rest were for support the chow hall workers secretaries security guards and operations support people such as analysts information technology specialists reports officers and people who handled technical intelligence gathering systems
451761 was greater than the number of people the agency had stationed in vietnam at the height of the war and the large numbers gave the impression that the agency was working very hard
451762 which is that i perceive myself as a tool to produce intelligence for the president to make decisions
451763 senior employees got to watch the video the next day
451764 some people had enormous output a few although they sat at their desks for twelve hours had none sending e mail to friends throughout the organization was a common time waster if anyone giggled while sitting at his desk it was a safe bet he was instant messaging with a friend in the agency if two people giggled alternately it usually meant they were sending messages to each other
451765 i thought they were just the greatest but if they had any weaknesses it was a certain cluelessness about how to advance in the organization
451766 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
451767 thats such a shame especially for the ones who were clean and its most important for the athletes who were second
451768 you lose that opportunity to stand on top of the podium and feel the joy of winning the race those are the people who hurt the worst when there are cheaters ahead of them giving back the medals is just a technicality because you cant repair the hurt feelings and the hard work that went into it
451769 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
451770 ive never wanted to do anything remotely close to doping its never ever crossed my mind ive never been approached about doing it its never been an issue my entire career its the last thing i would ever do
451771 going to the olympics is what ive always dreamed to do
451772 i guess it always seemed shorter because of the commercials
451773 the big thing is i havent been home since january
451774 but it will be very competitive everyone is very close maybe four or five seconds separating first from last
451775 i think well do pretty well if everything comes together a lot of boats will show up on the race course and you never know what the weather conditions will be like
451776 now that its past us we know what we are with this team going forward for the next two months
451777 having met these guys eight hours ago everybodys been extremely positive
451778 you jump around with those guys i felt like id been here all year we were like little kids
451779 it was strange getting used to the pace of filming
451780 with corrie we were filming so many episodes in a week that you hardly knew if you were coming or going but with heartbeat we can take a week to film one episode and a lot of care goes into putting it together you feel like you are part of something very special
451781 my first day was quite nerve wracking as the show is hugely successful and well established so being the new girl was always going to be scary
451782 but i was so excited to join as ive been a huge fan for years and ive been made to feel so welcome by the other cast members they all took me under their wing and after a few days i felt like part of the furniture
451783 we have like 15 songs and there wont be 15 on the album so we have potentially four different albums
451784 theres no track listing yet as we cant decide theres four five or six albums depending which tracks we use many different combinations would make different types of albums
451785 we still think in terms of albums although people who buy music probably still think less like that than they have done just because of the culture of downloading songs i dont feel we have competition at the moment we are a bit out of the loop
451786 a unique mixture of classical metal acts like helloween malmsteen and rainbow but still having its own sound
451787 i think that gay marriage should be allowed if theres a ceremony kind of thing if you want to call it that
451788 i dont have any problem with that but i do believe in preserving the sanctity of the union between man and woman
451789 could i just mention one other thing on the issue of the gay marriage i believe if people want to have private ceremonies thats fine i do not believe that gay marriages should be legal
451790 antithetical in every way to the core philosophy of republicans
451791 we have the creative freedom to play any style of music we want we can play folk rock ballads instrumentals or tavern songs i couldnt do that in deep purple now i feel as if im not in a box anymore
451792 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research

451796 its not something that you can pick up and hold in your hand it is real a 1 part will break your momentum its like ridiculous sometimes when the media carries it to the point where momentum is great but you cant live and die by momentum because a 1 part breaks it
451797 to me confidence is more important than momentum because a 1 part doesnt necessarily break your confidence if a race team does not have confidence in their driver they will not over the long haul get great results their results will diminish as that feel good starts to deteriorate and go downhill ive seen it over and over again in my career theres something magic when a race team believes in a driver and when a driver believes in a race team theyll get better results than they even should for a long period of time based on that
451798 the teams performance is a reflection of our operations and what they do here at gillett evernham motorsports during the week
451799 this team works hard and prepares all week to go out on sundays and execute our strategy our objective is to get all three teams performing at that level so each can challenge for such awards and accolades we appreciate our peers recognizing the no 9 crew for this award our sponsors and mechanix wear for developing a program that rewards the efforts of the pit crews
451800 cheating the bad things good nascar nextel cup racers do in pursuit of speed
451801 it was good we just went out on yesterdays tires and set up and just worked on trying to get going we got going okay and then just threw a softer race tire on at the end and it took me a couple laps to get going and we did in the end we got the pole so im hoping for a good race today
451802 the whole appendix thing i just didnt want to go on a diet and i wanted to lose some weight and get a whole bunch of attention and publicity for it so thats pretty much the only reason for it

451807 im afraid of getting a judge who doesnt have a sense of humor
451808 they thought i was too offensive too explicit and too strong on sensitive issues like religion
451809 were not sure what he does is illegal but there is a possibility that it is not legal
451810 disgusting cartoons about our beloved prophet muhammad may allahs peace and blessings be upon him
451811 if people say my cartoons are disgusting that is fine by me i see lots of things i dont like beauty is in the eye of the beholder
451812 the kindly god who lovingly fashioned each and every one of us and sprinkled the sky with shining stars for our delight that god is like santa claus a myth of childhood not anything that a sane undeluded adult could literally believe in that god must either be turned into a symbol for something less concrete or abandoned altogether
451813 the trouble is that god in this sophisticated physicists sense bears no resemblance to the god of the bible or any other religion
451814 religion with or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things but for good people to do evil things that takes religion
451815 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home

451823 members know that they have the option to be involved in political action or not
451824 obviously general funds were used for the political action committee which violates the rights of the members to decide whether they wanted to participate in political activities are not
451825 did not see approval of the additional expenses in the talb board minutes or representative council minutes
451826 thats it how was it done i just dont have the particulars in front of me
451827 they were held outside talb offices in secret places and we had no idea where they were
451828 mcvarish who could not be reached for comment has denied any wrongdoing during his tenure at talb it shows a total lack of accountability for our senior staff and executive officers because they bypassed the board and the rep council
451829 should not be secured with funds from the general fund as that restricts cash necessary for the payment of the ongoing operations of talb
451830 there might have been problems with our procedures and some of the ways that we deal with our finances
451831 but through the audit and through a lot of work we rectified a lot of those problems or virtually all of those problems
451832 its the members money of course they have every right to know
451833 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
451834 ive said before ive been consistent ive consistently said ill repeat again
451835 i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time
451836 i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time but to give us a usable answer to our offers stop dallying
451837 a clear signal for a mutual freeze we would freeze our sanctions efforts and iran the development of its centrifuges this is a clear offer that deserves a clear answer and soon
451838 we would then have to further increase pressure via sanctions
451839 its about time heikki and i started one and two so im very pleased
451840 the car was great but you can never be too comfortable although i feel safe in the position im in
451841 were both on great strategies for the race to push for the win and i aim to do that it would be great to have a one two in the race the team deserve it and i feel heikki and i do too weve been working hard for it
451842 the car has been feeling strong the last few races
451843 we have been improving the package more and more which is a great effort from the team and tomorrow should be quite an interesting race
451844 i just couldnt do a great lap as i managed in q1 and q2 but we are still pretty strong
451845 we are there and i feel i can push these guys hamilton and kovalainen tomorrow
451846 if you could download a loaf of bread free you would
451847 but you cant thank god because otherwise bakers would cease to exist and there would be no bread to download
451848 i am so sick of the stealing analogies these corporate parasites keep coming up with
451849 it will be a pretty seamless transition for the depositors

451856 laat je coachen man kijk nou eens in de spiegel
451857 dat zal allemaal best maar h ft u een opvolger
451858 waarschijnlijk wel maar dat is natuurlijk niet zo maar ge
451859 heeft u hem nou w l of heeft u hem nou ni t
451860 ik denk het niet opvolgers genoeg maar niet voor u
451861 dus u komt helemaal hierheen om mij te zeggen dat u geen opvolger voor mij heeft en dat het niks zal worden
451862 nee ik ben bang van niet u heeft deze week vast wel gelezen dat u straks tot 70 jaar door mag gaan en als ik u was zou ik dat zeker doen
451863 welnee u bent zo verbonden aan het kantoor aan uw werk aan de mensen hier u bent er volgens mij nog lang niet aan toe
451864 weet u dat lijkt misschien zo maar ik ben het z verschrikkelijk zat ik ben zooo moe van al dat gedoe het was altijd een heerlijk vak al negentien jaar ben ik notaris in dit prachtige dorp maar een dorp verderop zit sinds kort een kantoor met een jonge snuiter daar joegen ze vier jaar geleden de tarieven omlaag en toen begon de ellende mijn kandidaat liep over naar de buurman mijn oudste secretaresse ging met de vut en mijn aktenaantal en omzet daalden als een guillotine dus de tarieven ook maar aangepast en ja daardoor kregen we meer werk maar goed meer werk met minder mensen lagere omzet minder winst hogere kosten wat dat betreft heeft u gelijk als ik tot mijn zeventigste doorwerk dan kan ik mijn pensioen nog wat aanvullen maar mijn batterij is eigenlijk helemaal leeg ik vind r geen donder meer an
451865 today is the first day of the rest of your life
451866 those who we welcome into the uk to work and settle here need to understand our traditions and feel that they are part of our shared national culture they need to integrate into our country learn english and use our language
451867 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
451868 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
451869 i dont come out of central casting im young im new to the national scene my name is i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
451870 what that means is that im sort of unfamiliar and people are still trying to get a fix on who i am where i come from
451871 what has been an approach of the mccain campaign is to say hes risky
451872 as ive said many times we must be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in
451873 we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage
451874 senator barack obama said thursday that he might refine his plans for a phased withdrawal from iraq after meeting with military commanders there later this summer
451875 obama strives to retain some flexibility on his iraq policy
451876 we must be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in
451877 he will of course not rely upon some plan that hes crafted as a presidential candidate or a u s senator he will rely upon a plan an operational plan that he pulls together in consultation with people who are on the ground
451878 under this strategy the united states would not withdraw its forces based on a firm unilateral schedule rather the time horizon for redeployment would be negotiated with the iraqi government and nested within a more assertive approach to regional diplomacy the united states would make it clear that iraq and america share a common interest in achieving sustainable stability in iraq and that the united states is willing to help support the iraqi government and build its security and governance capacity over the long term but only so long as iraqis continue to make meaningful political progress
451879 mmmm impressive but no thanks i already have a sharpie
451880 ive been a nurse more than 20 years had i ever seen anything like that when i was working i would have reported that doctor in a minute
451881 as he was locked on me i went to push him down and he moved up a bit and it wound up slapping him on the back i feel badly that it went down like that but i am going to stand by my guns that i didnt do anything wrong
451882 it created a tremendous buzz when it was shown in britain
451883 that was russell saying what would happen if i press every button at once
451884 said moffat who came to town with julie gardner the bbcs controller of drama commissioning and an outgoing executive producer of
451885 no use pretending its not art house its not even authored in a way its a big massive brand a bbc brand the most important show
451886 the interesting question is where to place it for that family audience
451887 it does moderately well for the sci fi channel but it transmits for a 9 p m slot which it isnt written or made for
451888 you know what were pleased with the way its been performing for us
451889 youre not special youre not powerful youre not connected youre not clever youre not important
451890 fancying people and not knowing what to do about it
451891 tosh is learning about herself coming out of her shell shes a late bloomer
451892 we were losing a team member and a part of our torchwood family
451893 you dont know a hell of a lot about him
451894 when we first met him he was not a very likable person
451895 im going to be an action hero i might get my own figure i love science fiction
451896 i thought they had far too much time on their hands
451897 therell be a ticking clock a big event and it will push the torchwood team into new territory
451898 of your fellow three panelists marry shag push off a cliff
451899 naoko no offense youre going off a the cliff but id shag her before i threw her
451900 and id have to marry gareth because ive seen him naked
451901 i would love to play captain america my manager probably just sent an e mail to the studio to let them know
451902 if you buy my book the story is in there its called anything goes and it did
451903 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good
451904 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
451905 sie hatten keinen grip und ich rutschte nur herum hatte kein gef hl f r das auto
451906 ich bin entt uscht obwohl das q3 wohl nicht m glich gewesen w re konnte ich meine q1 zeit im q2 nicht wiederholen
451907 wir h tten eine gute chance gehabt in q3 zu gelangen aber ein hydraulikdefekt hat mich daran gehindert die zweite session in angriff zu nehmen
451908 was die reifen angeht wird es auch morgen interessant beide mischungen sind hier sehr weich heute waren die h rteren besser f r mich
451909 ich bin nicht zu 100 prozent zufrieden mit meiner session die reifen haben sich nicht so verhalten wie wir es erwartet hatten das graining hat eine gute balance des autos unm glich gemacht
451910 ich hatte mich am ende f r die h rtere reifenmischung entschieden wodurch sich das graining noch in grenzen hielt
451911 das ziel war eine zeit von 1 21 700 minuten zu erzielen am ende waren wir sogar um eine zehntelsekunde schneller
451912 die balance des autos war in ordnung das griplevel leider nicht wir m ssen akzeptieren dass wir auf dieser strecke nicht sonderlich stark sind

452265 i worked for boeing all my life when i was about your age my job was writing the operations manual for the 747 the manual filled up two binders about this thick
452266 i wrote the manual in such a way that even you could sit down in the captains chair open it up to page one and follow the directions step by step and fly the damn plane without any training whatsoever for the life of me i cant figure out these directions whoever wrote the sequencing needs to be taken out in the street and beaten

452268 both myself and tim howard left manchester united to join everton and people thought it was a step down
452269 but for me and tim it was a massive challenge to prove we could play our football away from old trafford and at a club that wants to be challenging the top four
452270 were really lucky at everton that weve got a manager who wants to get into that top four as well weve also got a history and a fan base that suggests we are a massive club
452271 that is why we joined and the club is going in the right direction
452272 i think the challenge is still the same if not greater at a club like everton
452273 the expectation level here is no different than to at united
452274 the fans expect us to win every game and they expect us to win two or three nil
452275 that challenge that pressure and that expectation is what drew me to everton and its why im enjoying my football just as much as ever
452276 when you have many young players you cannot keep them all
452277 the most important thing is that you develop them as a player and they have a big career
452278 at some stage you have to consider the quality of the player and what is in front of him
452279 at the time the players in front of bentley like ljungberg and robert pires were better than him
452280 he wanted to play more central in the dennis bergkamp role and i felt at the time he was not ready
452281 there comes a moment when a player has to play to develop when you feel that you have to make a decision to let him go or keep him
452282 the fact that bentley is now a national team player proves it was the right decision
452283 we deserve praise because we were not stupid and keep the player in the reserves
452284 at youth level you are working 90 for other clubs
452285 some players who are just a little bit short for you go somewhere else but you have an influence on their development
452286 when you have an academy of our quality not every player can make it
452287 we have two or three players now who have the quality to play for us and some others go somewhere else
452288 the rules are quite clear if you want to buy a player who is under contract you call the club and ask how much they want and are you ready to sell
452289 if the answer is no then they do not need to speak to the player no is no
452290 it is the same for real madrid manchester united arsenal or anybody else arsenal is not more an angel than real madrid
452291 if you ask me about ronaldo then it is entirely down to manchester united if they want to sell they sell if they dont want to sell they dont because ronaldo has extended his contract
452292 it is a problem between real madrid and manchester united
452293 its always nice to score goals when you are new in the team and it was good to get off the mark in my first game for the club
452294 i dont know because ive asked phil gartside bolton chairman and hes not aware of it and im not aware of it i presume its our kevin davies
452295 weve not had anything other than a conversation a month ago of you wouldnt sell kevin would you
452296 kevin i believe in the next 24 to 48 hours will be signing a new deal to put another year on to his contract hopefully
452297 weve been discussing that for probably the last six weeks

452307 dari sekian banyak percobaan ilmiah yang mengikut sertakan hewan sebagai objek penelitian hal yang paling tidak membawa hasil adalah percobaan penelitian psycologis karena penyakit kejiwaan manusia adalah hal yang unik yang hanya dimiliki oleh manusia itu sendiri
452308 pada saat kita memiliki kekuatan untuk mengubah sejumlah susunan unsur genetik dan fungsi otak yang memperlihatkan sejumlah pola neuron pada otak seseorang yang karakteristik hanya terdapat pada manusia maka sama sekali tidak dibutuhkan tindakan kejam kepada hewan hewan percobaan

452562 they searched his house twice and his computer once we all felt powerless to stop it
452563 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with the anthrax investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death

452595 i had a psycho boss who would tell you to fuck off one day and then be your best pal the next he was an alcoholic freak and very very mean he also used to pimp out his dog to other peoples lady dogs in our staff room at lunch time he was basically a grade a bastard i was so glad to leave
452596 i once had a boss make me pick up her dog from her house and carry it on the tube to bring it to the office i nearly resigned that day
452597 i had one who was a lawsuit waiting to happen

452599 my old boss was the reason that i left my old job she was awful a real bully shed pick on people for not getting enough leads and therefore they wasnt enough to converted to sales so the branch wasnt making money and colleagues wouldnt get a bonus she would pick on people out of 8 of us 3 were signed off with depression it was the most awful time
452600 my last boss used to pay us by cheque and asked me to remind him so i did and whenever i reminded him he used to swear at me and we were also due to be paid on the last day of each month and one of us would pop to the bank on our lunchbreak to pay everyones cheques into the bank so that it would start to clear the boss cottoned onto this so would hand us our cheques after lunch break at about 3 15pm so it was too late to for our cheques to clear which meant the money stayed in his bank for longer needless to say i left due to his attitude with this and many other things and i just got a load more of abuse for my last few weeks since leaving i then discovered from the inland revenue that he hadnt been paying my tax or national insurance which he then had to cough up
452601 i left my last job because of my old boss she was a complete nightmare and best mates with the overall boss who wouldnt do anything when i eventually got up the courage to complain about her one notable episode was giving my friend a nervous breakdown which was eventually caused by screaming at both of us in front of the whole office about something she had asked us to do and forgotten about and then assumed we had done it wrong the final straw was her having gone to a meeting and left me a note of some work she needed doing that i was to leave on her desk for her to collect when she got back from the meeting i had done the work exactly as she had asked and had the note to prove it and when i got in the following day got screamed at in front of the whole office because i should have known shed made a mistake on the note shed left and asked for the wrong thing such a cow
452602 my boss regularly goes in a bad mood for no reason its mostly just me and him in the office and he thinks its acceptable to completely ignore what i say on a daily basis then thinks that he can come in and start a conversation with me when hes snapped out of it

452708 god grant me the serenity to accept the things i can not change
452709 hmm let me taste a piece of that ham will ya
452710 i made a mistake on my final flying lap which cost me precious time and that followed on from not having got a great lap on my previous attempt which explains why im sixth
452711 of course i am not happy and starting from the third row my race will be an uphill struggle
452712 congratulations to lewis hamilton for his second pole position in a row and second pole position in hungary we must also congratulate timo glock for his best qualifying of the year especially coming after his accident in germany
452713 when the cars were lighter in q1 and q2 the super soft compound was generally the faster tyre
452714 i made a mistake on my final flying lap which cost me precious time and that followed on from not having got a great lap on my previous attempt which explains why im sixth of course i am not happy and starting from the third row my race will be an uphill struggle i will try and make the most of this situation given that the car today was not that bad we are going through a bit of a difficult time but we mustnt give up all we need to do is put together all the pieces of the jigsaw and then the results will come to us again
452715 having our main rivals two cars on the front row is definitely not the most promising start for the race but it in no way means the race is already lost for us
452716 the session was very competitive and more difficult than i though it would be in the end i managed to reach q3 and i am happy about that it means we can approach the race sensibly tomorrow and i hope we can make the most of this grid position to score some points
452717 as always the homework done during our free practice sessions has paid off by getting both cars into the final part of qualifying with fuel loads that we believe can help us have a competitive race as everybody knows it is really difficult to pass on this track and so after a good qualifying session pit stops are now of extreme importance
452718 subject of more derision and disparaging comments from john adams onward

452722 took seriously the idea that he wanted somebody who could if necessary take over
452723 a lot of spokes of government seem to come together in cheneys office
452724 that was a very good qualifying session for me and im obviously delighted
452725 we made a good start in first practice yesterday the team did a good job overnight and we made the right choice over set up it wasnt easy today because we had a very tight choice over tyres so we had to make a close decision for every lap
452726 but in the end my engineers stayed cool and got it right in q2 the car felt perfect then on the very last lap it was a bit trickier again because the tyres didnt behave quite as well but im happy with p5
452727 we are in a great situation for tomorrow its good for all of us and after hockenheim this is the perfect answer for the faith i have in the whole team
452728 im glad to be in the top ten but that was a difficult qualifying session and p9 is disappointing
452729 since this morning i have struggled for grip and balance and unfortunately we werent able to find the answers in time
452730 we knew that the qualifying session would be very close and that proved to be the case
452731 the first part was very competitive but we managed to reach q3 with both cars which is positive but i think the race tomorrow will be difficult thats for sure
452732 i will try and do my best to be on the pace and hopefully score some points
452733 the session was very competitive and more difficult than i though it would be
452734 in the end i managed to reach q3 and i am happy about that
452735 that was a very good qualifying session for me and im obviously delighted
452736 but in the end my engineers stayed cool and got it right in q2 the car felt perfect then on the very last lap it was a bit trickier again because the tyres didnt behave quite as well but im happy with p5 we are in a great situation for tomorrow its good for all of us and after hockenheim this is the perfect answer for the faith i have in the whole team
452737 im glad to be in the top ten but that was a difficult qualifying session and p9 is disappointing
452738 im happy for timo who has done a good job this weekend and it is clearly important for us to score as many points as possible for the constructors championship overtaking is very difficult here but tomorrow is a very long race and we will see what we can achieve
452739 from the pit wall that was a very exciting and pleasing hour of qualifying

452742 all the accused have to begin with lauded the act of destroying the babri masjid as a credit to the hindus these kind of speeches were clearly aimed at kindling the hindu populace into an aggressive stance against the backdrop of the riots it would be obvious to any prudent person that such incitement would lead to further aggravation of communal sentiments and violent acts the accused were all seasoned politicians and elected representatives with some maturity in spite of this it has come on record that they blatantly gave such speeches openly exhorting hindus to take to the streets instead of discarding their responsibility towards the public of trying to alleviate tension and restore normalcy such acts deserve punitive measures in order to send the correct signal to society at large that wrong doing would be punished

452748 whenever you see a deluge of stories in the media quoting government or intelligence officials its always worth asking why those unnamed officials have chosen this particular moment to speak out the accusations against the isi denied by pakistan are not new
452749 so i come back to my original question why turn on them now
452750 but i cant help but wonder whether those unnamed officials now so keen to talk to the media are spinning a line
452751 so is what we are seeing in the u s media a reflection of a battle within the cia over rival views on how to handle pakistan and the isi maybe
452752 or is it a reflection of actual events including the increase in violence in afghanistan the renewed focus on iraq al qaeda created by the u

452768 consumers are currently facing the worst financial reality ever in the 11 years of our study all three of our indexed measurements of consumer well being have decreased over the past quarter households now have to spend more on their mortgage repayments and council tax bills combined with the fact that their real earnings are failing to keep up with inflation and so they are feeling poorer and having to cut back in some areas of spending these bleak conditions are set to get worse for the rest of the year the labour market has remained fairly strong up until now but we predict that this will soften over the second half of 2008 as the number of people claiming unemployment benefit continues to rise
452769 many of the insolvency practitioners we speak to on a daily basis are saying that despite putting forward their clients best offers which comply with this years new iva protocol a growing number of creditors are asking for more modifications which are impossible for the debtor to manage
452770 as a result the only choice left for many people is the less restrictive option of a debt management plan which doesnt need to be approved by the courts and is quicker and easier to achieve
452771 however with the comparative ease of successfully organising a dmp comes an increased risk of failure
452772 creditors are not obliged to stick to the agreement and can increase their demands should they wish which just perpetuates the problem a dmp can also last for years putting the chance of making a fresh start that much further out of reach
452773 we are also being told by our callers that they are loathe to jump one way or the other until the economy settles down making the decision to take on an iva or go bankrupt is a major one and they would rather battle on until they cant hold out any longer
452774 theres been a lot of talk about the credit crunch over the past year but i would say its only now that the effects are really hitting their target and ordinary people are taking the blows
452775 from what we are told by the ips we work with and the people in serious debt who call us for help the fall out from the current financial climate will be felt for quite some time to come
452776 you cant jam the brakes on the runaway train of borrowing and spending that the uk has been riding for the past few years without serious damage occurring and thats what is happening now
452777 values for residential property in prime central london have now dropped for three consecutive months prices have now fallen by 4 7 over the past three months the largest quarterly fall recorded in the history of our index this has not yet quite wiped out the rapid value gains seen in 2007 and annual growth is still positive at 1 8
452778 sales volumes have been a particular victim of the slowdown almost 50 fewer homes were sold in prime central london in july compared to the same month in 2007 new instructions have also fallen and properties are now achieving on average less than 95 of their asking price
452779 over recent months we have noted that the super prime sector has been untouched by the downturn in july it has become apparent that the value of properties worth more than 10m are becoming even more divorced from the rest of the market rising by 1 over the month super prime annual growth now stands at 16 7
452780 in contrast homes worth under 3m are now worth up to 2 6 less than they were in july 2007 this sector is traditionally dominated by high paid city workers mounting concerns over future remuneration packages have combined with the well publicised difficulties in the mortgage market and lack of confidence in the wider market to markedly reduced demand from these sources
452781 meanwhile the commodities boom is continuing to create vast amounts of wealth for ultra high net worth individuals around the globe who still regard londons most exclusive postcodes as a highly desirable place to live or own property
452782 as a result the average price of properties sold in central london has increased drastically over recent months as the top end of the market significantly outperforms houses few and far between in prime central london are in particular demand and are holding their value better than flats this may also explain strong performance in the northern parts of the central area where entire houses are more common
452783 despite the current gloom there are signs of life in the wider market properties are now staying on the market for less than 60 days before sale the lowest level for six months this may indicate that vendors are finally becoming more realistic and accepting the new market conditions
452784 also viewings continue to take place at historically high rates indicating that the appetite for prime london property is not hugely dented but rather that buyers are waiting for the market to stabilise before making a move

452815 my husband claude use to say the real reason for the fireworks was to celebrate my birthday because i was the most special person in the world and he loved me so much then hed say it was a fact about the fourth of july that most people didnt know

452846 it was during this discussion that i received the first real confirmation of my suspicion as to the reason for nixons detour mr bassett who has been a leading figure in nixons past elections remarked to the effect that republicans have no place to go but with dick nixon and this being the case he was correct in trying to attract the liberal or left wing votes from this and other discussions i have concluded that this indeed the thought that motivates nixon as he detours around conservative principle if that is so and as of now we must assume it to be the case he is in dire danger of losing the 1960 election
452847 if he is a man who sets his course not by the stars of principle but by the winds and tides of expediency he will never be on any definable course

452853 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
452854 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
452855 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
452856 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
452857 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
452858 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
452859 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
452860 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
452861 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
452862 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
452863 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
452864 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
452865 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
452866 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
452867 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
452868 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
452869 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
452870 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
452871 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
452872 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
452873 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
452874 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
452875 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
452876 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

452883 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
452884 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
452885 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
452886 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
452887 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
452888 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
452889 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
452890 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
452891 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
452892 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
452893 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
452894 and the offensive line i think its hard to break in with the crusty pups in that group and hes done a really nice job earning their respect i think hes going to be a very good future player and well get to see a lot of him this preseason
452895 derrick is in the middle of the pack in punting in this league
452896 hes not a bad punter and hes not one of the elite guys i think he can do better he had an off year he would admit that as well hes had slumps in the past that hes come out of this particular year he didnt really come out of it that generated this competition
452897 with the whole dog and pony show last week you worry about taking away from the guys that have been here and setting up this organization for a long time
452898 you understand im just here to help im not coming in on a white horse to be a savior
452899 it helps everybody when you have two guys that can get to the quarterback like andre and jason can
452900 you can play regular pass coverage and its almost like a blitz because youve got those two guys coming the way they come
452901 it is definitely frustrating but i know i am working towards getting better
452902 im getting where i need to be im just excited that i got the opportunity here with the redskins to get better and the patience theyve had with me in bringing me back
452903 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
452904 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
452905 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
452906 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
452907 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
452908 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
452909 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
452910 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
452911 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
452912 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
452913 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
452914 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
452915 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
452916 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
452917 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
452918 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
452919 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
452920 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
452921 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
452922 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
452923 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
452924 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
452925 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
452926 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
452927 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
452928 who are open to doing something on the production side
452929 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
452930 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
452931 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
452932 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
452933 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
452934 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
452935 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
452936 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
452937 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
452938 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
452939 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
452940 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
452941 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
452942 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
452943 in hopes of providing a new level of security and protection for those suffering from memory and judgment disorders sheriff bill brown unveiled project lifesaver on thursday a program designed to assist law enforcement with finding missing people
452944 a former county jail guard is suing the sheriffs department claiming he was fired and discriminated against because he has cerebral palsy edward cox 26 says he was wrongfully fired and that employees there intentionally inflicted emotional distress and discriminated against him because of his physical disability according to a lawsuit filed july 11 in san luis obispo superior court
452945 pre trial motions in the case of people v mike carona the ex sheriff accused of public corruption continue to pile up in fact there are so many motions pending that u s district court judge andrew s guilford has scheduled a rare saturday hearing to hear arguments on two motions about evidence that may or may not be introduced at caronas trial now set for late october
452946 i will neither confirm nor deny that im entertaining the notion to run for sheriff

452950 de franse horecasector maakt dan ook een historische daling in zijn zomeromzet
452951 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
452952 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
452953 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
452954 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
452955 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
452956 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
452957 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
452958 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
452959 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
452960 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
452961 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
452962 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
452963 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
452964 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
452965 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
452966 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
452967 my lawn was brown and pretty much dying of thirst at that time so i watered the designs and not the rest of the grass
452968 i had gotten in trouble for letting my lawn go totally dead and i figured this might be one tactic to say it was an art project
452969 my work was looking fine until the rains came and sort of erased it on me but when the monsoons are over ill reseed the designs and make them larger and more visible
452970 i know how to use my weed eater to sharpen up the image and it will be a permanent fixture in my front yard when google earth retakes its satellite pictures in our area my symbols will show up to the whole world that i do not like our government making war for bad reasons
452971 the neighbors are cool with it and it could give people the idea to express themselves
452972 if you see someone do something that you believe in and its a novel idea then you might go out and also do something creative its sort of suggesting to the world that you expressed your feelings and your beliefs in any way you can thats not hurting anyone else
452973 the sun ruined the cds after a period of time and replacing all 200 of them was not an option
452974 its like a black hole when you have no one else who understands what you are going through
452975 but to find people who understand who speak the same language and listen to you is refreshing and encouraging
452976 ultimately our goal is to educate the community about type 1
452977 everyone in the group is so involved that you can send out any comment and get a reply right away
452978 before we knew it we had come up with seven families to have a potluck at the park and ever since then the group has been growing
452979 we now have 20 families who keep in touch and support one another
452980 in an effort to continue to improve upon tempes record of excellence in owning and operating a pollution control facility
452981 when you exceed you have to stop discharging we see that we immediately divert the water back into the sewer system
452982 were in the process of permitting for tempe town lake use
452983 theres no reason to buy all new coloring stuff when we still have everything from last year
452984 when you have so many kids you have to shop around and go to discount stores i save hundreds of dollars that way
452985 my kids go to a charter school so our list is much more extensive
452986 if you go to public school you could probably get away with 5 if you shop the sales the right way
452987 it seems like a waste to buy shorts when its so easy to make shorts from torn or short pants that still fit him around the waist
452988 really when it comes down to it i spend less and use what i got
452989 the challenge is to pair living well in the desert with an urban context
452990 you cant just decide you want a bunch of jobs
452991 and you cant just lay out a bunch of land and say this is where the jobs go you have to do what is necessary to support the kind of jobs you want to get
452992 rather than drawing absolute hard lines on a map and saying this is what can go here nothing else you make a big picture policy decision about generally speaking what goes in various areas
452993 but you allow significant adaptability as to what those uses can change into over time in response to the market
452994 the intent is to create a different kind and character of neighborhood
452995 you do that by creating streets that have more shade that have sidewalks pulled away from the curb so you dont feel like youre walking in the middle of six lanes of traffic
452996 you cant have a community that has this level of amenities and thoughtfulness about development and come in at a low price
452997 if theres a silver lining in expensive fuel prices its that people are forced to think about the new paradigm in the southwest where we have for many many years had the luxury of driving 20 30 miles to work we really dont have that any more
452998 were setting up a platform that helps people respond to that paradigm shift
452999 my brother and i get into an argument with a taxi driver about getting our change back he got on his mobile phone and all of a sudden at least 15 greeks with baseball bats batons and chains appeared out of nowhere
453000 they demanded we hand over our wallets i think they look for any excuse to hook into tourists
453001 my brother was able to run and seek help and so only received minor cuts and bruising but in trying to reason with these thugs they punched kicked and belted me with their weapons for a 10 minute period
453002 i tried to run but it was very late at night and we were in a secluded part of the island with no one else around to help i was bashed so severely that my eye socket was smashed to pieces requiring major surgery when i returned to london where i am currently living
453003 my whole eye orbit had to be reconfigured with three metal plates and 12 screws the experienced surgeon who operated on my eye told me that i was lucky to be alive and just as lucky to still have my eye
453004 grandiose titles that mean nothing more than a paid subscription fee
453005 our college provides appropriate training in cosmetic surgery whereas plastic surgeons are trained in the public system where there are no cosmetic patients to give adequate training
453006 in my humble opinion i am none of those things
453007 it is like a bad comedy my relations with the protection officers were cordial and i am still friendly with a few of them at the end of my nine years of protection they held a reception for me i had a lot of sympathy and understanding from the police
453008 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everybody elses business or their personal lives its inappropriate
453009 if you notice since britney spears started wearing clothes and behaving paris hilton is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue

453018 microsofts biggest challenge is to get would be customers to set aside whatever preconceptions they have and listen to its pitch for vista aligning its most vocal vista critics with the flat earth society is a clever way to get peoples attention
453019 ads responding directly to those ads is a losing tactic largely thanks to john hodgman the humor bar is set extraordinarily high any kind of response ad would legitimize the claims in those apple ads and run the significant risk of being seen as lame and uncool source

453025 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
453026 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
453027 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
453028 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
453029 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
453030 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
453031 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
453032 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things
453033 im like well does that mean were really not ready for a black president
453034 it has been addressed with the youngster and the families involved
453035 we certainly do our best to make sure incidents like that dont happen

453059 we also want a rescheduling of the league to october the start of the dry season as the heavy rains this time of the year have a great impact on the wear and tear of our playing equipment
453060 we cant imagine the lfa is pushing us to play at venues with no security at all quamie said
453061 the lfa is looking into improving the league through sponsorship but with the teams bickering it would be difficult to attract such a deal

453133 when you go to the stores all they have are clothes that show a lot of skin
453134 in this day and age girls are growing up in an environment where it seems ok to dress provocatively were concerned
453135 we want girls to know they can be beautiful and stylish and modest
453136 we tell them first impressions are important and what does it say if the first impression is showing everything
453137 living a life in accordance with gods will and fostering a life of grace through purity of heart mind and body
453138 this counterbalances all the negative images out there theyre learning that beauty is who you are not what youre showing
453139 i feel so much more comfortable when i wear sleeves on my shirt or wear shorts that go to my knee
453140 modesty is a way for me to show my faith every day
453141 the proms are another way we can emphasize modesty in both appearance and behavior
453142 the typical bridal gown is not modest anymore theyre backless or sleeveless and cut down to there
453143 we knew there were girls who wanted to be both modest and fashionable

453146 young and dynamic and optimistic and all theres going to be this glow about them that is going to be worth collectively the two of them maybe 15 points
453147 what weve found with miscanthus is that the amount of biomass generated each year would allow us to produce about 2 1 2 times the amount of ethanol we can produce per acre of corn
453148 one of the criticisms of using any biomass as a biofuel source is it has been claimed that plants are not very efficient about 0 1 percent efficiency of conversion of sunlight into biomass
453149 what we show here is on average miscanthus is in fact about 1 percent efficient so about 1 percent of sunlight ends up as biomass
453150 on the factory floor foreigners are paid less than their japanese counterparts and personally i think these sorts of things should end
453151 there should be equality for all i know it will be difficult to achieve but we must have a fairer society as soon as possible
453152 the constitution says that to vote for parliament you must be a citizen but in the case of election for local governments it is up to the residents to decide who votes
453153 many foreigners have the right to stay in japan for life since they pay taxes here they live the same lifestyle as japanese they use the same language we do and they bury their ashes here i think thats the least we can do
453154 my family has been here since my grandparents were brought here but without suffrage it feels like our existence here is meaningless
453155 lets face it the bulk of the foreigners here are from the koreas and there could be a clash of interests between japanese people and korean people
453156 it is very strange to talk about this issue as if it were some kind of war compensation making up for our colonization or because president kim wants it
453157 some people are trying to hide the fact that they are korean because they are suffering discrimination in japan
453158 they can do so because the features and skin colors are very close to those of japan but we try to teach people that koreans are koreans and however close we may feel toward other people we should never obscure our identity
453159 i respect my parents heritage and dont wish to become something else
453160 voting is not the only thing at stake here we feel that we have been deprived of many of our rights and want to be recognized as normal residents rather than being looked down upon like some second class population
453161 what the japanese are selling is nothing more than cabbage sprinkled with seasonings and artificial flavorings
453162 this debate is not just about protecting our market share we are trying to preserve our national heritage
453163 orders for kimchi just keep pouring in from all over this acceptance of our national food makes us very proud
453164 theres anti korean feeling everywhere these days the students feel anxious and uneasy
453165 we never thought north korea would do such a thing it should never have been allowed to happen now the japanese media has over reacted and thats created a very threatening atmosphere
453166 we were kept at a reception camp for the first month and then we were sent to a remote mountain village where the people were very hostile
453167 all the returnees were classified according to their family background and we were put in the lowest class the very bottom of society with people whose loyalty to the state was in doubt
453168 we were down to just one meal a day and the following spring we had to survive on boiled grass and bark from pine trees

453174 no one can argue that the issue of high energy costs and their impact on american families does not rise to this level
453175 the new direction congress led by democrats has offered real solutions to bring down energy costs
453176 but a majority of congressional republicans have voted no each time they should go home to their districts and explain their record of obstructing common sense proposals to address the pain at the pump being felt by american consumers and businesses

453185 gratulation an lewis hamilton zu seiner zweiten pole position in folge und zu seiner zweiten pole position in ungarn
453186 wir m ssen auch timo glock zu seinem besten qualifying des jahres gratulieren besonders nach seinem unfall in deutschland
453187 als die autos leichter waren im ersten und zweiten qualifying teil war die super weiche mischung generell der schnellere reifen als die autos im dritten qualifying teil jedoch schwerer waren schien der weichere reifen der schnellere gewesen zu sein und schien den fahrern ein besseres gef hl gegeben zu haben
453188 mein start war nicht so toll und ich war nur noch dritter zum gl ck konnte ich meinen fehler bereits in der ersten runde wieder beheben dann habe ich so hart wie m glich gepusht um einen gro en abstand herauszufahren was mir auch gelungen ist bis die kritischen berrundungen anfingen assen und ich das passt einfach
453189 mir war klar dass von rang f nf aus doch noch einiges m glich sein kann doch der start begann mit einem schock ich hatte durchdrehende r der und habe noch mal zwei pl tze verloren allerdings habe ich bereits in der ersten runde wieder drei pl tze gutmachen k nnen sp ter konnte ich noch vervisch und suzuki berholen
453190 mit meinem guten start konnte ich gleich die f hrung bernehmen leider war unser topspeed nicht optimal sodass cecotto berholen konnte insgesamt musste ich mich heute mehr verteidigen als ich angreifen konnte trotzdem freue ich mich sehr ber meinen ersten podiumsplatz auf den hoffentlich noch viele weitere folgen
453191 es ist eine schande dass ich es nicht geschafft habe im dritten qualifying teil das beste aus dem auto herauszuholen haupts chlich wegen verkehrs besonders auf meinem zweiten versuch
453192 in den ersten beiden teilen des qualifying f hlte sich das auto gut an wie man dies auch anhand meiner zeiten sehen kann
453193 ich werde versuchen den kampf der beiden fahrer vor mir in der startaufstellung auszunutzen
453194 ich schaffte es jedoch nie die reifen bestm glich vorzubereiten das berholen ist klarerweise nicht einfach aber wir haben ein gutes tempo und ich werde versuchen den kampf der beiden fahrer vor mir in der startaufstellung auszunutzen
453195 ich leistete mir auf meiner letzten fliegenden runde einen fehler der mich wertvolle zeit kostete und dies folgte auf die tatsache dass ich auf meinem versuch zuvor keine gro artige runde hatte was erkl rt warum ich sechster bin
453196 nat rlich bin ich nicht gl cklich und mein rennen wird nun ein bergauf kampf sein da ich aus der dritten reihe starte ich werde versuchen das beste aus dieser situation zu machen angesichts der tatsache dass das auto heute nicht schlecht war wir machen eine etwas schwierige zeit durch aber wir d rfen nicht aufgeben alles was wir tun m ssen ist die teile des puzzles zusammenzuf gen dann werden die resultate wieder kommen
453197 es ist definitiv nicht der viel versprechendste start f r das rennen die autos unserer beiden hauptgegner in der ersten reihe stehen zu haben aber dies bedeutet keinesfalls dass das rennen f r uns schon verloren ist morgen wird es wichtig sein einen guten start hinzulegen in felipes fall zu versuchen einen vorteil aus jener seite der strecke zu ziehen auf der mehr gummi liegt und mit den reifen so gut wie m glich zu haushalten bedenkt man dass wir sehr hohe temperaturen erwarten k nnen
453198 hinzu kommen die blichen parameter strategie zuverl ssigkeit teamwork die optimal arbeiten m ssen um ein gutes ergebnis zu erzielen wir m ssen alles geben um so viele punkte wie m glich einzufahren und erst am ende des rennens werden wir sehen ob wir ausreichend viel geleistet haben oder nicht
453199 unser hauptziel an diesem wochenende war es und ist es immer noch das maximum aus unserem auto reifen team paket herauszuholen und heute sind wir gescheitert dies zu tun besonders im letzten teil des qualifyings
453200 what came out of this report was not only are they are target but that a lot of the cybercriminals would prefer to go after the small and medium sized businesses
453201 and one in three have said that if they had a serious attack it would put them out of business
453202 the last thing they should have to worry about is security and this tells us that in fact that is the last thing they are worrying about
453203 that means that we need to provide these companies with security technology that allows them to only spend an hour a week and still be secure

453257 our culture which is a mix of the old south and the rugged west demands that you be a gentleman around women
453258 that is certainly the way i was raised there was a rigid line that you did not cross in your formal relationship with other women i knew that if i was not careful in my criticisms of sissy farenthold i could be perceived as a bully you can be a lot more aggressive when you are running against another man

453291 hmm good performance but if juhi wud have done it she wud have done wonders
453292 i thought we were beyond this racist stuff but clearly we are not you can oppose tribal netting and not be racist but some of these people make everyone look like an idiot
453293 most of the comments were like indians dont do it fish our way our way is holy and theirs is horrible and we dont like it
453294 i would remove it but it shows that the most vile forms of racism still exist in this country
453295 i have a hard time believing this is a malicious attack but maybe im naive somebody has been trying to shut us down
453296 in the early days of the tribal rights issue our official stance was not to have a stance we knew it could get pretty ugly so we didnt want to take a position the general consensus in the community was that we were pro indian but tribal members thought we were anti indian the assumption on both sides was that we would unquestioningly support the non indian angling community so everyone was mad we must have done something right

453307 why should insurance compoanies or taxpayers have to subsidize the pill so women dont get irritated and hormonal every
453308 many health insurance plans cover viagra but wont cover birth control medication
453309 birth control is a basic health care need for almost all women the only reason it isnt covered is insurance companies might have to reduce benefits for men and increase them for women
453310 the way things are going i figure theyre gonna walk away with 60 or 80 million profit
453311 thats insane ive never seen this kind of thing before of course flatiron has higher expenses than a minnesota company theyll have to charter a 757 to fly the money back to germany

453315 obviously you have not reached that plateau yet as you referred to that brook trout i caught as being only 8 inches then proceeded to reduce its size to 6 inches it was 14 inches or was it 18
453316 just for fun i pulled out your entry in our lutsen cabin log that you wrote

453320 the telly is the premier award honoring outstanding local regional and cable tv programs as well as the finest video and film productions
453321 to receive this kind of recognition during our first year of existence is remarkable and winning in four different categories is even more astonishing we take this as an indication that our decision to pioneer online programming for the substantial but neglected niche of millions of genealogists was a risk worth taking

453347 were not hitting tennis balls were hitting people isnt that more exciting
453348 he can get more done on the side working out and its more of an insurance kind of thing for us
453349 i cant tell you if its a day two days three days
453350 its certainly not because of conditioning hes in great great shape
453351 if i thought that there was something that he wasnt doing to put himself in a place to be there like i said i think hes overworked a little bit it hasnt been an ongoing thing he wants to be in the mix so hell get back as fast as he can as fast as well let him
453352 i let it be and as i said the league is going to deal with that
453353 those guys spent a great deal of time in the offseason program taking care of that and we had it set for a day back during the otas where we could do it en masse i think its counterproductive to do it here a day before you start to deaden their legs
453354 i have cdo its like ocd but all the letters are in alphabetical order many people have mild ocd
453355 and when those who disbelieved devised plans against you that they might confine you or slay you or drive you away and they devised plans and allah too had arranged a plan and allah is the best of planners
453356 religion came from a time rife with the need for crowd control and it clearly was introduced as a form of that
453357 as if all guys say that when they only want one thing
453358 oh he must be desperate if he wants to give you a rose
453359 we should be quietly confident but never take the voters for granted and to work hard to serve them
453360 the pap must always have that spirit to want to serve the people of hougang believing that we can do better for them if we are in charge that must always be our spirit but of course its for the people there to decide

453364 i found proof of god hon its scientific so even you wont be able to disagree
453365 the universe is made of string hon and thats what god is
453366 why are you repeating yourself are you afraid im right
453367 look gran string theory is about dimensions and combining quantum mechanics with general relativity its nothing to do with god
453368 thats where youre wrong hon the scientists themselves say so that guy in the wheelchair said string was the mind of god
453369 only when they disagree with the bible dear youre grasping at strings
453370 so why are the scientists only wrong when they go against the bible
453371 because dear there is so much evil in the world that sometimes when they let their mind slip satan can inspire evil in them
453372 how can they sometimes be evil and sometimes be good if someone is good should they always be good
453373 satan can use whatever means he wants to turn someone against god
453374 the whole world is in a state of war between good and evil even since satan fell we have had to take sides so we have to make choices and those choices are good or evil like that catholic pervert abusing little boys was evil and sending him to jail was good
453375 but you said that hovind doing tax evasion was ok and sending him to jail was wrong
453376 hon he was doing godly work that priest was just gratifying his lusts see everything is either evil or good it just takes a bit of prayer and god will tell you which because what is not with us is against us the god book saith that is everything is either evil or good
453377 how about when used by the us troops against the taliban or by police to catch a serial killer
453378 just as satan can twist gods work into evil ways then god can use satans machinations for good

453396 i dont want to talk about it but i have definitely experienced abuse in a way that i would tell people to take their heart and run
453397 it doesnt matter how he hurts you with his hands or with his words you dont deserve it it aint worth it take your heart and run
453398 i would walk down the school halls and hear people talking about me
453399 they would also write things on the sidewalk in permanent marker they really hated me

453402 major league baseball the ibaf international baseball federation and the ioc are working diligently to have a system where our big leaguers are playing
453403 i think if chicago or tokyo would win olympics for 2016 those countries are baseball countries and they have venues
453404 i believe they are trying to work up something you have a few years to get a plan there are a lot of moving parts but dont rule it out
453405 its not too premature to say the minds are turning trying to work things out
453406 instead of a three day break for an all star game you might end up have a four or five day break and get all the games in some kind of way using major leaguers
453407 its not too premature to say the minds are turning trying to work things out
453408 some of the obstacles drug testing we definitely met a lot of those requirements
453409 were putting on a real good show around the world with baseball and i believe the olympics are going to definitely want to have baseball back in the fold
453410 hes been terribly disappointing and i just fancied a race like this would suit him but i didnt expect him to win
453411 he just got lucky today got a lead and there was a bit of juice in the ground
453412 my first impression was that he should have won as he got stopped at a terrible time and likes quicker ground than that
453413 that was fantastic and im very pleased it was always going to be a well handicapped horse that beat him and that is exactly what has happened
453414 hes run a cracker as hes only a little horse carrying all that weight
453415 there was no drama or ugliness they just decided to end things there is no hatred just sadness

453421 were serious about the wild card race and in fairness to our offense we needed to try to do something to improve our pitching we owe them that
453422 we felt that we needed to try a different direction with the pitching staff a different voice a different message

453425 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
453426 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
453427 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
453428 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
453429 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
453430 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
453431 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
453432 and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but well work on it and we will deal with any potential grievances
453433 we wanted to express to the governor our outrage in what he has done in letting someone like this loose

453444 the governor did an end run around the labor process and the government code
453445 its not simply flipping a switch and all of the salaries of identified employees go to 1 100 a month
453446 the state constitution and a supreme court decision clearly support the governors action
453447 he is prepared to defend this in court if necessary to protect the states ability to meet its obligations

453461 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
453462 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
453463 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
453464 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
453465 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
453466 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
453467 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
453468 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things
453469 im like well does that mean were really not ready for a black president
453470 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
453471 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

453476 its hard to beat january and february but this is a lot of fun too
453477 a lot of teams are doing training camps overseas because it puts you in the time zone of beijing but not actually in beijing itself so you can get away from the chaos and pollution so we get acclimated to the heat and the time zone but are in a different city
453478 its a lot of preparation im busier now than i was in athens im arranging local medical contacts reviewing athletes medical histories and getting pre approval for all the medicines we need for example medicine for add because they can be stimulants so that has to be taken care of beforehand a lot of paperwork has to be done to get approval for these medicines weve had a couple of medical issues so we have to work with that there have been a lot of issues that creep up and take time
453479 you are at most of the events until 11 11 30 at night and sometimes after the events youre at doping control the drug testing is usually done at the end of the day after the finals
453480 there were eight or nine physicians and different physicians have different main sports i covered diving swimming open water swimming synchronized swimming so when those sports are going on youre with those teams at the venue during the day when swimming is over you cover other sports i covered boxing and the mens marathon the usoc physicians are there for the whole games swimming is held over the first nine days but the games go for 16 days so on any given day you would be at the venue in the morning for the team where they are competing and usually there is a break in the afternoon at the village where we run a walk in clinic for u s athletes staff and coaches then in the evening youre back at the venue with the team so youre with the team when they are competing or at the olympic village there are about 600 athletes and 1 500 members of the u s delegation so it gets pretty busy
453481 its the fun part of doing two different types of sports medicine
453482 swimming is much more over use type of injuries there are a lot of shoulder problems some back and knee injuries but its not that type of sport part of what you do is travel medicine issues like travelers diarrhea upper respiratory infections urinary tract infections and things like that that go with traveling new time zones and new foods and there are lacerations and falls and joint dislocations and fractures things like that occur with a group of 600 athletes
453483 there is a group of physicians around the country that takes care of our athletes and i started working for that group when i was a resident
453484 i started running our sports medicine program for usa swimming right around 2000
453485 being a swimmer and having interest in it and then ultimately working at the national team level and on international trips you kind of work your way up from smaller meets domestic meets and then you start doing international trips at the olympic level you have to spend some time at the u s olympic training center in colorado springs usually a 2 week internship and you live there and take care of a lot of different athletes a number of athletes live there and train there for all kinds of sports and you have to do all that to get your foot in the door then ultimately you can be named to the international staff of the olympic games
453486 in fact the reason i stayed in the new york area is probably because of russ
453487 i love it its an honor and a tremendous experience working with guys like ronnie barnes the giants vice president of medical services byron hansen the teams coordinator of rehabilitation and steve kennelly the assistant head athletic trainer you learn so much ronnie is everything therapist trainer and doctor combined into one its a phenomenal organization
453488 its time away from family but its a great opportunity and you only live once
453489 im sorry that im missing camp but i asked ronnie if i can do this and luckily we have russ and bryan kelly also an associate team physician and other people so they have good coverage i wanted to make sure of that because i wouldnt have done it again if it would compromise anything with the giants
453490 knowing is not enough we must apply willing is not enough we must do
453491 it was only once it was just the once right
453492 weve known each other for such a short period of time
453493 the stop stretched from 10 minutes to 15 and 20 and the bus driver kept counting people he even honked as we pulled away im pretty sure we left someone
453494 we went to cuba in april wed been in december too all we did was drink
453495 do you know what i just heard about one of your friends
453496 before telling me anything id like you to pass a little test its called the triple filter test
453497 before you talk to me about my friend it might be a good idea to take a moment and filter what youre going to say thats why i call it the triple filter test the first filter is truth have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true
453498 actually i just heard about it and wanted to tell it to you
453499 so you dont really know if its true or not now lets try the second filter the filter of goodness is what you are about to tell me about my friend something good
453500 you want to tell me something that is not particularly good about him but youre not certain its true you may still pass the test though because theres one filter left the filter of usefulness is what you want to tell me about my friend going to be useful to me in other words do i really need to know this

453532 capisco beh non c ragione neanche nel lottare in s per s ma lo si fa e basta perch lo si ritiene giusto
453533 per non puoi fare sempre a meno di qualcuno anche se sei forte si cede prima o poi
453534 purtroppo ma ho capito che non combatto per me stesso e se ci sto solo io non combatto per nessuno perch in teoria io non voglio essere felice in pratica si
453535 si abbastanza perch sono felice se gli altri sono felici
453536 si la mia filosofia sfocia nellautodistruzione ma dopo c la beatitudine che ben pi grande della felicit
453537 scusa se ti posso sembrare scettica ma cm fai a pensare che venga della beatitudine dal dolore il dolore dolore e basta lo si evita non si pu andargli incontro anche perch prima o poi ci trova comunque
453538 dipende da che dolore una persona che soffre se soffre per se stesso pu essere egoista per gli altri no la vita non ci stata data a caso uno strumento
453539 si ma pensa se tu sei felice quando gli altri sono felici ed cos per la maggior parte di noi come fanno gli altri a essere felici se tu soffri loro soffrono per te e tu soffri per loro e vi condannate inutilmente
453540 soffrire statico soffrire vuol dire star male e basta non cambiare le cose il cumpatire del tutto infruttuoso se io soffro per qualcosa e non faccio niente logico che condanno tutto il sistema pur essendo in buona fede soffrire per adoperarsi invece una cosa che pu costruire
453541 non lo so secondo me si felici solo quando si trasforma il dolore stesso nella felicit che uno cerca ma questo avviene solo se il dolore finalizzato a qualcosa senn se eterno inutile
453542 secondo te una persona ordinaria nella vita complessivamente pi felice o soffre di pi
453543 gi appunto se il dolore fosse finalizzato alla felicit mi avresti risposto che felice
453544 ma io non parlo della realt io dico le cose come dovrebbero essere senn non direi che un mondo di merda
453545 gi si soffre proprio perch non si sa sfruttare bene il dolore

453551 islam does not distinguish between the american people and the american government since both are in a state of war with islam
453552 after all these are the people who elect the american governments and who even elected president george bush for a second term in office despite their awareness of his agenda against islam despite witnessing bushs many brutal actions against the muslims these people re elected him they are the ones who pay the taxes that enable the american government and army to wage war and spill the blood of muslims

453896 damit ist auch endlich die frage beantwortet ob ich dem team und dem auto vertraue
453897 ich war nicht hundertprozentig zufrieden mit meiner runde aber ich denke dass wir dran sind und den jungs im rennen druck machen k nnen
453898 es w re toll wenn wir auch im rennen einen doppelerfolg feiern k nnten
453899 auf meiner letzten runde waren mir gleich vier autos im weg die meisten haben wenigstens versucht mir platz zu machen aber bourdais war mir am ende komplett im weg
453900 ich habe ihn hinter mir gesehen aber was h tte ich anders machen sollen ich wollte auch meine runde zu fahren

453907 was die reifen angeht wird es auch morgen interessant beide mischungen sind hier sehr weich heute waren die h rteren besser f r mich
453908 nach dem q2 hatten wir uns ein bisschen mehr ausgerechnet aber jeder reifensatz hat sich anders angef hlt und ich hatte nie eine freie runde auf der outlap um die reifen auf temperatur zu bringen
453909 ich bin ganz happy dass wir auf p5 stehen damit haben wir eine gute ausgangsposition f r das rennen
453910 die zeit war ganz okay aber ich habe im ersten sektor viel verloren weil der reifen nicht funktioniert hat vielleicht h tte ich sonst robert kubica schlagen k nnen aber jetzt m ssen wir mit platz 5 zufrieden sein

454041 a large portion of the public sees the pope and the church as bogged down in these arcane theological disputes dating back to the reformation it also sees a pontificate that is defined by ancient ritual and ceremony not what you might call the common touch our hope is that by showing the pope in an unexpected and contemporary setting that the ordinary catholic might come to regard his holiness as a more approachable and relevant figure some of us would have preferred that he went to a club thats fashionable right now like bungalow 8 but that was too big a step for others and so we compromised on an 80s disco
454042 even a single presidential assassination is one presidential assassination too many

454044 even a single presidential assassination is one presidential assassination too many

454048 even a single presidential assassination is one presidential assassination too many
454049 the term pro israel has been hijacked by those who hold views that a majority of americans jews and non jews alike oppose
454050 the most pro israel thing any american politician or policy maker can do is help to bring about a two state solution and a comprehensive peace agreement between israel and her neighbours
454051 i believe that aipac has very broad support and will continue to enjoy it
454052 j street will get hammered and accused of being anti israel

454056 itll be a long time before we fight a war over used veggie oil
454057 this whole project is about the political imagination of what it means to follow after jesus
454058 the language of jesus as lord and savior is just as radical as it would be to say jesus as our commander in chief today
454059 they delivered for him in some key states like ohio without which he could not have won
454060 it was the rallying of the evangelical base that karl rove dom deluise developed as a strategy maximizing turnout among your base voters not worrying about independents or swing voters
454061 i would say that social justice and issues like that have definitely arisen as an important part of my faith and because of that it affects how i vote and think of those things definitely
454062 there are certain issues where i identify more with republicans and other issues where i identify more with democrats so i really am completely undecided at this point
454063 these voters are starting to become independent swing voters instead of a lock for either party
454064 for democrats also its a successful place because when a group had been voting four out of five republican and they start becoming a swing constituency that also has significant electoral implications
454065 with the respectability and the power of the church comes the temptation to prostitute our identity for every political agenda
454066 for many of us caesar richard deacon has colonized our imagination our landscape and our ideology

454072 because if you dont apply youll turn into this total loser sitting around in your room pathetically dreaming about some job youll never have because you havent even made the option available to yourself
454073 well its good to have high expectations all around youre a catch and you should be picky
454074 well i think for a westerner it would be fine to find just a common one
454075 maybe i just know chinese too well and i find them too
454076 the normal westerner is fine for me chinese are not as cultured and unless he is very very good i will not want him

454102 the most potent mass of cholesterol i have ever seen anyone ingest
454103 youre a copywriter who gets it and you wonder why other people dont you understand that meaning comes not from the words but the experience you dont write copy you start conversations you understand the transformational power of a network and you think about connections between brand and consumer between consumer and consumer between websites emails banners tv print and direct mail you have ideas you have talent you work hard you play hard and youre the next copywriter at company name redacted los angeles

454105 its crusty its juicy its got cheese oozing over it its basically one of the only times even a food snob can really say that theyre into american cheese and get away with it it just works
454106 it has to have 20 fat or youre going to get a dry burger im just not into lean burgers
454107 i cant eat too many traditional burgers because i have to watch my cholesterol i think people will love this burger because it doesnt skimp on flavor but is a far healthier alternative to the traditional beef
454108 its a much smaller fish that is sourced not from the mediterranean but from hawaii
454109 it is always caught wild its also a great variety of tuna because its not as fatty as others but it still tastes great
454110 often i can trick people into thinking theyre eating beef with this burger
454111 buffalo is low fat 92 lean so you wont have as much flame up on an outdoor grill but you should also cook it quicker than you would a piece of chuck
454112 no matter what you think this buffalo meat isnt gamey like elk or venison and if you cant get some from comanche you should be able to find buffalo at any specialty meat market now
454113 you can use a beef merguez sausage to temper the flavor of the lamb if lamb sausage is a little too strong
454114 i also use the lamb shoulder meat because it has the best flavor and maybe the neck because it has more fat you can ask your butcher for it but the key is to grill the burger to medium but let it char a bit over high heat for a good flavorful crust

454117 whydidnt i follow cheesy american pop stars to capri which btw is terribly overpriced and currently in a state of classless ruin by the onslaught of modern tourism
454118 w hat i found was that the bush administrations foreign policy bore a striking resemblance to the conservatism that developed after world war ii under the tutelage of william f buckley jr and the magazine he founded national review buckley and colleagues like james burnham advanced a view of the cold war not as a struggle between superpowers but rather as an apocalyptic struggle between good and evil

454130 were going to try to celebrate a focus of living in peace on a day to day mentality instead of just once in while
454131 were trying to elevate our ability to hold on and make good decisions and doing the right thing
454132 to elevate the understanding and awareness for the people around our community that theres a big movement happening in many ways with great support from the agencies around the city

454143 lulz is watching someone lose their mind at their computer 2 000 miles away while you chat with friends and laugh
454144 you look for someone who is full of it a real blowhard then you exploit their insecurities to get an insane amount of drama laughs and lulz rules would be simple 1 do whatever it takes to get lulz 2 make sure the lulz is widely distributed this will allow for more lulz to be made 3 the game is never over until all the lulz have been had
454145 we know that fios will create new jobs and plenty of work for our existing work force
454146 having said that it would be unfortunate if a strike comes but well deal with it if and when it comes
454147 labor will continue to go to work without a contract while the union leadership ratchets up its rhetoric regarding the need for a contract and verizon expresses optimism a fair agreement is possible
454148 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
454149 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
454150 it reinforces the idea that were seeing a steady but not dramatic decline in employment which is likely to last for some time
454151 there is some room for optimism on the corporate profit front
454152 but a lot will depend on consumers and energy prices for the remainder of the year
454153 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging that the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
454154 since i was a young girl its been my dream to become no 1 in the world

454210 children and dogs are as necessary to the welfare of the country as wall street and the railroads
454211 ive worked with a lot of artists em and they all have a need that cannot be met by another human being
454212 its raphael hes outside the n is keeping him busy with his lame jokes
454213 he wants to see you i believe he mentioned something about emma listen bro i dont know his intentions but keep it cool okay the girls still sleeping and we dont want to wake her up do we
454214 there are no superior beings but the creator we are all the same
454215 its okay ill stand make this quick i dont want emma to see us here
454216 emmas 18 now and kids her age dont have imaginary friends anymore for how long do you intend to stay here anyway they grow up and soon they will have to send you back with force you cant hang around them all the time its in your contract
454217 he said its time the feathered guy said its time
454218 keep her away from those two ill think of something whatever it takes she must not see raphael understood
454219 i wont remember n whatever it takes keep her away busy whatever just dont let her see him
454220 well after all these years i cant recall my exact words concerning clinton but they were to the effect that he was a draft dodger and whoremonger i would note that i was merely repeating what was said about clinton by a high ranking military officer who was forced out of the service for saying them
454221 in terms of shakespeare i feel like hamlet being stalked by the king and his men
454222 you know i never thought about beating a woman before but i had this vision of just stomping her to death id go for her throat and try to break her neck real quick because shes a little thing and then finish the job by stomping her body with hobnail boots
454223 bill clinton was the last thing on my mind at that time i was a limo driver for mears transportation i took a weeks vacation to visit washington d c to check out the job opportunities for a person in my line of work i also wanted to visit the memorial to those who died in service of their country during the vietnam war i have a few friends named on that memorial yes i did have a weapon with me for personal protection but it remained locked in the trunk of my car and unloaded in regards to me not knowing that clinton was in russia during the week i spent in the washington d c area all i can say is that im a news hound of course i knew he was in russia however as ive said before i was not interested in harming the president
454224 threatening the life of the president of the united states
454225 the u s attorneys attitude and one that he was successful in selling to the jury was so what if the case against barbour was far from perfect he was going to assassinate the president in other words he couldnt prove it he just said it and that was good enough for the jury
454226 our system of justice has many ominous parallels with the star chamber of yesteryear decisions are made behind closed doors and the average citizen isnt entitled to know anything about the process
454227 for instance after numerous freedom of information requests i cannot find out anything on how the secret service determines who constitutes a threat against the presidency if youre able to discover anything will you let me know ive been trying to find out for years
454228 that not something we share we dont talk a lot about protective intelligence
454229 the subject went to the mall every day for six days waiting to shoot the president
454230 he hoped that if he shot the president he would be shot dead himself fortunately the president was overseas at the time
454231 im not sure she knew members of the news media were at the conference
454232 we receive cases involving threats on a rather consistent basis and we investigate them all to the fullest if a defendant knows how its done they might be able to manipulate the process
454233 the state of maryland prosecutes linda tripp for illegally taping monica lewinsky but the guy who does the same thing to me gets off scot free come on give me a break
454234 i remember at that time feeling 100 percent confident that no state attorney would think of prosecuting harris for turning over a tape that might have saved the life of president clinton
454235 the court completely and properly rejected the defense arguments because harris was a patriot
454236 what advice could you give the secret service to enable it to better protect the president
454237 good luck your only hope of finding out how he went from class ii to class iii is to file under the freedom of information act and wait a few years and hope youre satisfied with the results because theyre usually not satisfying
454238 prosecutors have an extraordinary amount of discretion you can take any two cases in the country and say why this and not that and because there is so much discretion cases like these do raise legitimate questions of oversight involving the legislative branch over the executive
454239 can you believe it the secret service considers my military career a negative factor in my case
454240 i had always been a free man in my mind so a readjustment to life outside prison was extremely easy for me
454241 there is no crueler tyranny than that which is perpetrated under the shield of law and in the name of justice
454242 i was there at the party where ron was taped by that stacy harris character and i heard the tape in court and i can tell you my brother never said those things about killing clinton and an assassination attempt
454243 and i told that to the court my brother got screwed big time by bill clinton everyone knows he uses the courts to get people who dont like him clinton was impeached by the house of representatives back in 1998 for perjury and obstruction of justice there is not a doubt in my mind that either bill clinton or one of the lackeys got my brother sent up the river did ron tell you he lost everything his military pension his apartment his car his bank account everything and for what telling the truth about that degenerate and traitor bill clinton i detest bill clinton i hate hillary clinton i think the democrats are filthy lying leftist elitist scum and the main enemies of the republic so send me to prison for four years too
454244 ron is not a physical threat to anyone says scott ellis brevard county commissioner ive known ron barbour for years he helped out in my congressional campaign in 1986 barbour is politically astute enough to know that shooting the president doesnt effect political change i think this injustice shows how a corrupt president can bend the federal court system and the secret service to do his will did a conspiracy exist between ron noble the director of the secret service and senior special agent john mckenna to put ron barbour in prison at the orders of president clinton i understand that while clinton was governor of arkansas his enemies were sometimes hauled into court on bogus charges i well recall that in 1995 or 1996 that rush limbaughs radio studio was raided by the secret service because limbaugh was alleged to have threatened clinton and they were looking for an audiotape to prove it the secret service found nothing and limbaugh was not charged
454245 i was a juror in barbours trial at the federal courthouse in orlando in late may 1994
454246 there were two counts on his indictment the first was u s c 1751 the attempted assassination of the president the second was u s c 851 threat against the president we found barbour guilty of the second charge which carried a five year sentence this happened because one juror the foreman wanted to find barbour guilty of both counts and the rest of us thought he was innocent so this was a compromise the deliberations went on for nearly three days and the best reason the foreman who thought barbour was guilty could come up with was that barbour would not have been charged by the government with this crime if he was not guilty at least barbour was spared the worst fate in our verdict because conviction on u s c 1751 would have carried life in prison
454247 i was ron barbours attorney in the trial and wrote both his appeals
454248 barbour should get a de novo review of his case

454255 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
454256 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
454257 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
454258 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
454259 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
454260 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
454261 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open

454277 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
454278 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

454282 in future years we will likely see more young men blaze the same trail as jennings especially if jennings shows there is a viable path to professional basketball that does not include a pit stop in college and also provides an opportunity to earn money and get their families out of poor circumstances at an earlier date the ncaa should either respond to this fast changing world by letting go of its notion that u s born players should be compelled to attend college for a set amount of years or by enhancing the experience it provides these gifted players

454342 not all people are familiar with the technology of digital printing but they are familiar with bringing their rolls of film to photo printing shops so they go there to print photos from their digital cameras or phones

454347 she should produce and make public these documents that she claims she has she should do this not later than monday to prevent any fabrication of documents
454348 otherwise i have every reason to believe that senator jamby is having periodic bouts of hallucination and needs to see her psychiatrist at the makati medical center more often than she does anyone in her stature should be more circumspect before mouthing accusations
454349 senator madrigals action is not fit for her stature as senator of the republic public hearings are not barbershops and sari sari store drinking bouts where people can just exchange gossip based on hearsay and speculations
454350 senator juan ponce enrile was correct when she described senator madrigal as a purveyor of falsehood now shes at it again making accusations without a speck of evidence to prove her claim
454351 her attack on the family of speaker nograles is another jamby mardi gras a mere spectacle to get media attention she should focus on joining raids by the optical media board it also gives her exposure without ruining the lives of people who dont go around running after some inheritance to make a living
454352 with due respect to senator madrigal i believe that it was very reckless for her to mention the name of speaker nograles in a public hearing by the senate without even bothering to spend some time to research what she is talking about
454353 she stepped over the line of the time honored protocol on inter parliamentary courtesy speaker nograles represents the house of representatives and it is very irresponsible for a senator to be dragging his name in a senate investigation without checking her facts first
454354 you cannot just destroy somebody elses name based on speculations under the cover of parliamentary immunity

454358 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
454359 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
454360 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
454361 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
454362 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
454363 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

454380 i didnt want to go at first sheila kinda had to drag me now i cant get enough i actually really look forward to it which seems strange right but it seems like my whole week is about other people my wife my kids my employees when i sit down with my wife in counseling it seems like its my time to focus on me im not saying its not about my wife its just its my time to reflect and i don t have that in my average week
454381 if we hadnt gone to counseling i think we would have been done we were stuck in such a cycle such a well worn pattern we tried to break it honestly hal and i knew it we would sit down and try to figure it out we bought books we asked our priest we even talked to friends but somehow well the problem was bigger than us it seemed when we worked our stuff out with the counselor we realized our problem stemmed from childhood issues no wonder why we were having trouble figuring out ourselves
454382 i think counseling is actually kinda fun is that weird but its my time to connect to beth she seemed so far away for so long and now shes engaged and interested in moving forward with me so its such a positive experience even if its hard session we leave on a high because we feel more connected and thats what i wanted the most of all

454417 readers are now invited to make up their own version of the joke leading to this punch line the best of which will win a
454418 this is the same thing that was done four years ago or eight years ago
454419 you guys are all familiar with this we have seen this movie before
454420 the one thing we know about the team that john mccains assembled because its a carryover from some of the folks that worked on bush campaigns and some of the republican campaigns in the past is that theyre very good at negative campaigns theyre not so good at governing and thats why if you think about this week what theyve been good at is distraction youve got statistics saying weve lost another 50 000 jobs that floridas in recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about were paris and britney
454421 i dont think its accurate to say that my comments have nothing to do with race
454422 heres what i was saying and i think this should be undisputed that i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races for a whole range of reasons im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama i am african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate what that means is that im sort of unfamiliar and people are still trying to get a fix on who i am where i come from what my values are and so forth in a way that might not be true if i seemed more familiar
454423 and so what i think has been an approach of the mccain campaign is to say hes risky
454424 to try to divert focus from the fact that they dont have any new ideas when it comes to fixing the economy or dealing with health care or dealing with education let me be clear in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think theyre cynical and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues and so its of a piece with the britney paris ad or the most recent web site or the allegation that somehow i wouldnt go visit the troops unless i had reporters with me which every reporter who was on the trip knows is absolutely not true
454425 if i was presumptuous or taking this for granted i wouldnt be working this hard this week
454426 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think theyre cynical and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
454427 the purpose of the site is to act as a repository and sounding board for discussions around digital media and its use in museums it evolved form a team discussion tool into a sector resource
454428 to validate the statute an individual must have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering
454429 because specific intent is an element of the offense the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture
454430 such as death organ failure or serious impairment of body functions
454431 that statute defined an emergency medical condition that warranted certain health benefits as a condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity including severe pain such that the absence of immediate medical care might reasonably be thought to result in death organ failure or impairment of bodily function
454432 the health benefits statutes use of severe pain had no relationship whatsoever to the torture statute and even if it did the health benefit statute did not define severe pain rather it used the term severe pain as a sign of an emergency medical condition that if not treated might cause organ failure and the like olcs clumsily definitional arbitrage didnt seem even in the ballpark

454447 these cases underscore the importance of continued clinical vigilance so pml can be discovered and managed appropriately
454448 we do not believe that tysabri will be withdrawn based on this data but it is likely to spook investors as the true rate of pml in tysabri monotherapy is unknown

454451 there are a lot of wonderful people doing great work but lung cancer survival rates of 15 5 after five years havent changed for 40 years why is that
454452 were not discovering drugs slowly just because of a faulty business model
454453 we dont understand so many things about toxicity in the human body its hard because its hard
454454 and unlike the internet where people were maniacal about sharing stuff biomedical scientists are exactly the opposite

454466 argylers were still in full cry elaborating on the traditional scottish patterns by knitting diamonds within diamonds and combining diamonds with plaids and stripes argyles were so popular for high school cheerleaders that the going rate was 20 a pair for handknit ones
454467 argyle knitting teenagers were humored by one authoresss jaunty introduction you all know what im doing knitting and i love it knitting all the time right now im turning the heel of a pair of gray red and navy im sure hell like these socks socks and more socks he just cant get enough of them socks prove that a little goes a long way probably he clings to the precious wool but maybe hes taken up nylon and if thats his liking nylons your meat its a great advertisement too with socks so easy to carry around and knit she never clarified what was being advertise but with nylon as the meat someones trap was baited

454469 on average producers are no longer paying to have birds removed if they are using their own catching teams costing 6 7p a bird there may be a few pence per bird left over
454470 weve come from a situation where 10 of cull hens sold in the uk were sold whole as complete birds largely to the ethnic trade to one where the vast majority of carcasses are split with most of the breast meat used by the home market
454471 the export market is now a major buyer with china via hong kong taking wings while west africa is accounting for legs
454472 at the time producers were paying up to 16p a bid to have them removed from their units it was because there was no export market operating and this supply of meat relies on an export trade
454473 the angel of the heart for those who love and are loved

454475 so you can see where wed be without the golf
454476 theyre the most effective and cooperative vendors ive ever worked with
454477 theyre working outside and dealing with unexpected problems such as rain and wind and even flooded parking lots
454478 that was our first national exposure and it gave us the credibility to start leveraging for more golf business
454479 the competition was taking the business for granted and we werent
454480 we offered a high quality menu with more variety rather than a glorified concession product like some did
454481 it was five to 10 years of sales effort starting to pay off
454482 the commissions charged by some venues can eat up profits pretty quickly and there are venues where food quality is not a very high priority
454483 the fact was the market was in no way ready for our message
454484 it was hours and hours of high anxiety interspersed with brief periods of sheer terror
454485 before we even buy a radio spot for a client well know how many of a particular group of patients are listening to a specific radio station at a specific time in a specific area

454487 the organic movement was just getting started when our dads started the company

454506 they did some then they went and got more this guy gave him way too much he went to sleep and never woke up
454507 these kids are not going to get out from under peer pressure
454508 i tell people if heroin is in your neighborhood sell your house and get your freaking kid out of there right now get out of dodge
454509 my heart goes out to the parents its just a national tragedy this is supposed to be a beautiful community
454510 unfortunately because it can be snorted kids think the stigma of being a drug addict is removed
454511 theres not the same stigma as when a hard core drug user injects it
454512 if you look at natalie and you hear the description of her you would never in a million years think that she was a child that would use heroin
454513 you ask 10 out of 10 people what a typical heroin addict looks like and theyll say its a junkie in the street with a needle hanging out of their arm
454514 youre not going to see the telltale signs like track marks and needle marks
454515 the kids have been told about the detriment of using cocaine alcohol or marijuana but heroin was never discussed really thats something from a generation ago
454516 a kid was asleep at the table next to them and then his buddy comes out of the bathroom with a needle and blood running down his arm he had heroin in his pocket and he got arrested
454517 i approached her and she told me she got it in school that day
454518 when your daughter has had one overdose and they dont come home we both immediately started crying
454519 how can we be responsible for someone and not have any authority
454520 they look at their good healthy beautiful kid and they feel secure i dont want them to feel secure and thats what got to me at the wake i saw these mothers
454521 even with a 15 year old what do you do
454522 tie them down and take them to a doctor or to a rehab im not sure what the answer is and im not sure the officials know what the answer is either otherwise they would be doing more about it its just alarming

454526 there are reasons to be dubious that the comeback is real and sustainable experts continue to fear the specter of deflation unemployment remains high and companies are reluctant to hire given continued overcapacity and lack of capital spending in many industries
454527 what we get from this adventure is just sheer joy and joy is after all the end of life we do not live to eat and make money we eat and make money to be able to enjoy life that is what life means and what life is for

454537 i wanted to take a moment and share with you something that happened this morning
454538 this morning i was working on yet another resume for a plant employee and one of the employees came to my office
454539 i really appreciate you and what youre doing for us and i baked you a cake
454540 right now i have to focus on my current activities here and not be sidetracked by my own job search i think it would be very selfish of me especially after this morning thanks again for your very informative presentation last night i look forward to speaking with you soon
454541 its amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper
454542 i read this report again and was surprised to find that it really wasnt that
454543 those are the first couple of things i look for but really there is no perfect guy theres always something youre going to have to accept that you dont like i dont like guys that smoke weed
454544 indeed it can hardly be doubted that in the modern commercial world a right to retain and use capital for a period of time interest free is a valuable right it is clear from the cases that the question whether a receipt or accrual in a form other than money has a money value is the primary question and the question whether such a receipt or accrual can be turned to money is but one of the ways in which it can be determined whether or not this is the case in other words it does not follow that if a receipt or accrual cannot be turned into money it has no money value the test is objective not subjective the commissioner taxed the companies on the basis of the benefit consisting in the right to use loans without having to pay interest on them that benefit remained whatever the companies did or did not do with the loans

454555 los angeles superior court commissioner reva goetz ordered jamie spears and britneys lawyer samuel ingham to keep responsibility of her financial and personal affairs until the end of the year
454556 it is my understanding that ms spears is reluctantly agreeing that we extend the temporary letters of conservatorship
454557 britney has made clear to everyone that she does not want to be further harassed or contacted in any way by osama sam lutfi

454563 john rouse was a father of five children aged between three and 25 years and all his children are now left without a father
454564 this was a horrific offence compounded by the fact that this poor man was found by his mother
454565 please dont stand behind false loyalties to people such as this because this was a horrific callous pointless and needless attack on a man who was clearly at that time in no position to defend himself

454578 some industry sources believe mr garrett will soon announce the government will increase the means test on the solar panel rebate program from 100 000 to 150 000
454579 but this would still be a bad result for australias solar industry and for home owners wanting to install solar panels
454580 it still makes it harder for many people who want to install solar in their homes it would still treat the rebate as welfare not a positive incentive to boost the renewable sector in australia

454583 i was in union mo which is 98 percent white a rural conservative and what i said was what i think everyone knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
454584 there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this
454585 hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states hes new to washington yes hes african american
454586 it is going to be very difficult for republicans to run on their stewardship of the economy or their outstanding foreign policy

454592 its a college preparatory program that includes a summer component and an academic component during the school year

454594 it feels great giving back to the program i had great counselors in my life
454595 i see these kids going through the same things i went through i feel blessed for having such a wonderful opportunity

454603 id like to suggest the fight against illegal drugs be included in the battle against global warming
454604 we wanted to break the format and do something different particularly after how powerful the climax was with the death of two major characters
454605 so were telling one big story in season 3 and putting the torchwood crew under a huge amount of pressure and just seeing how they cope with their numbers depleted
454606 it was a really difficult decision behind the scenes because we love them as people we love having them around and they were great characters you cant keep doing that where the team doesnt die week after week after week year after year youve got to show what the stakes are
454607 i have to say when i was told about the storyline i kind of agreed
454608 obviously i was kind of sad and sort of depressed in that sense about im going to miss everyone and the character but i think with her i think she really came full circle and she went through so much and it felt just right
454609 id be in a mall or wherever and people would come up saying ive never cried so much
454610 but there is a tiny part of me that kind of prefers she does stay dead
454611 its a big show for bbc america and its a show they are really proud of and it works really well i dont exactly know what that means in physical numbers but it gets a lot of airtime and it gets a lot of coverage

454624 the pearl of great price and the treasure hidden in a field were a reminder of the vastness of what is at stake compared with that all other successes are meaningless men will make the kingdom their own only if they are willing to sacrifice everything else for it
454625 the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which someone found and hid then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field
454626 again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls 46on finding one pearl of great value he went and sold all that he had and bought it
454627 truly i tell you there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of god who will not get back very much more in this age and in the age to come eternal life
454628 whoever would save his life will lose it and whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospels will save it
454629 if you wish to be perfect go sell your possessions and give the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me
454630 do not be afraid little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom sell your possessions and give alms make purses for yourselves that do not wear out an unfailing treasure in heaven where no thief comes near and no moth destroys for where your treasure is there your heart will be also

454644 we started earlier with a number of new olympic preparation programs that really are built on our learning from turin and our learning from otp
454645 there have been individuals throughout history alex baumann is a great example victor davis is a great example greg joy is a great example lots of people have been that outspoken about wanting to win in the past
454646 i think the biggest problem if there is a problem with speaking out like that is that canadians think its a strong stance
454647 often people say yeah i want to win a medal because they think its bad to say i want to win theres nothing wrong with that thats what competition is all about
454648 we will get the medals that we get and people will prepare with the resources that we have
454649 we can say i only believe in gold im here for gold none of that matters if you prepared properly and you execute properly and your potential is to win you will win it wont depend on whether you said you were going to do your best or promised gold
454650 weve had unfortunately a lot of injuries in the last two years
454651 i know what i need to do and i think if i follow my plan ill do ok right now i just really want to make it through to the final
454652 i guess they wanted to get us out of the pollution but im actually really looking forward to the training camp it will give me a chance to relax
454653 hes been on the olympic radar for london but to make it to beijing is amazing hes just a little a head of schedule
454654 but my wife and i have had a hunch about him for a long time

454666 while the people of afghanistan today are bearing the brunt of international terrorism on a daily basis it is with tremendous trepidation that we are watching the wild fire of terrorism spreading across the region
454667 it is time we all realise that the pursuit of narrow geo political interest and the use of militant radicalism as instrument of policy cannot succeed or serve any long term purpose
454668 as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of former premier benazir bhutto
454669 while existing on the absolute fringes of our tolerant and peace loving societies terrorists in our region receive institutional nurturing and support
454670 we still have a lot of work to do there are issues that we will have to address we have to move forward to the nsg we are going to keep this momentum up
454671 in international affairs we have to wait till it happens on the ground level
454672 we have not had any discussion or agreement of the so called timeline of two weeks

454682 the story of a boys physical infatuation with a girl whom he does not love
454683 you cant do that its not allowed youll have to drive round to security immediately
454684 one of the biggest problems is space to turn we get obstructed by other vehicles dropping patients off or by police vehicles
454685 it looked quite good at the end of yesterdays practice and also this morning
454686 but on my last lap in q1 i had four cars in my way
454687 most of them at least tried to give me room but it still cost me time
454688 towards the end of the lap i had one car in front which was on an out lap
454689 he then overtook sebastien bourdais before the last corner and then sebastien was right in my way
454690 i was hoping it was so obvious he would be penalised right away and i could still get into q2
454691 i was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and thats just the way it goes sometimes in the last run everybody is trying to get their last lap
454692 what can i say i didnt try to slow anybody up i just tried to get my lap and it didnt happen
454693 he complained several times about traffic on his last and important fast lap and missed getting into q2
454694 im pretty happy with fourth place i was not expecting such a good result and im quite confident for the race
454695 it was quite a difficult qualifying as all through free practice the car was difficult to drive
454696 it was bumpy the car was changing balance there was quite a lot of oversteer especially on the hard tyres which are better so it was quite difficult
454697 toyota looks strong i dont know the fuel loads and stuff like this but starting fourth we are hoping for good points especially after two unlucky races
454698 it would have been nice to have had a bit more pace in q3 but q2 and q1 went well for us
454699 im disappointed im on the wrong side of the grid an odd number is always better but we definitely have a chance to get something from where we are so well see how we go tomorrow
454700 i was losing a little bit of time in each of the sectors and i couldnt deliver that last little bit of lap time because i was bringing the mid corner speed too low
454701 its tough from 13th for sure but the hungarian race can be unpredictable so lets see
454702 ooo laura mah guardate io rido questo mi ha fatto venire la ridarella ihihihi comunicati a me lenoteca sembrava alanis morissette lol sofy18 4

454704 they thought we were drug dealers and we were treated as such i dont think they really ever considered that we werent
454705 cant think of a hero consider robert redford or brad pitt
454706 in her novel she will eat pounds and pounds of chocolate but still weigh less than a doughnut and he the hero whose thighs can bend steel will actually understand her needs and shall never interrupt her unless it is to ask
454707 we were in the process of talking with the u s attorneys office about it when he came in
454708 we didnt get anything significant from him either damaging or otherwise but he was interviewed and after we interviewed him we charged him
454709 we just had some information relative to interviews we had done with other people that established for us that it was obvious that the fathers actions caused her death
454710 i was trying to make that 18th hole before a thunderstorm rained out the golf course what happened to me what about my wife and children
454711 that was like ten thousand years ago you guys were all totally dead between then and now weve got a social networking system like you had on your wild wild web where youll be able to register and find all your loved ones its really fab

454713 you can put a request in with the administrators all they need is your four dimensional location in the space time continuum you know when and where you owned mr kitty and theyll find him
454714 if any of you can remember homeless people or people who didnt have any friends if you could take some time to describe them to our caseworkers wed really appreciate it were missing a lot of people here
454715 arent you all seeing and all knowing how can you lose people
454716 the universe and time are really really big we cant keep track of everything in it
454717 would you mind behaving a little more professionally young lady
454718 for most of us this resurrection is a very sacred experience
454719 uh huh look lady there was like billions of people alive on earth when you were alive multiply that by like thousands of years and thats like um a lot of people okay what makes you special
454720 i attended every sunday and donated thousands of dollars to the ministry over my lifetime
454721 well this is science heaven okay do you remember being in some christian heaven before you arrived here
454722 the high price of gas is taking a toll on summer travelers
454723 congress is now taking a monthlong recess of its own
454724 unfortunately democratic leaders are leaving town without taking any action to ease the burden of high gas prices on families across america
454725 that allows us to tap the extraordinary potential of oil shale permits exploration in currently restricted areas of northern alaska and enables the expansion of americas domestic refining capacity
454726 thousands of people including petitioners who have gone to beijing seeking justice from the government have been swept up in efforts to clean up the city before the games
454727 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
454728 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
454729 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
454730 this alstare suzuki is a really really good team and its my first year in a factory team so im really happy about how its going
454731 im second in the world championship and ok i cant get the title this year
454732 ill do my best at each of those races but its not so easy to find a different setup from track to track we have to work a lot with the suzuki to find a good set up at each track
454733 ive signed for the next two years with suzuki i like this team and all is perfect i feel great here
454734 es como una m quina del tiempo para la web

454739 i enjoy being out there being quiet and appreciating the people who lived there 1 000 years ago imagining what chimney rock meant to them
454740 multiple use worked for a while but now the uses are in the same place you cant have recreation cultural resources energy development and cell towers all on the same spot
454741 i think the agencies are aware of these conflicts but because theyre stuck with these archaic laws theyre between a rock and a hard place
454742 fencing dozens of sites for the facilitation of energy development is not what we had in mind when we supported the designation of the monument
454743 they are part of the eyes and ears on the ground
454744 we need help either from volunteer groups or law enforcement
454745 and to have the companies fund those kinds of efforts might help its about ensuring that what we say is going to happen in here gets done
454746 it is so good to follow lambeth 2008 and learn that tom shaw is a conservative
454747 de tous les peuples de la gaule les belges sont les plus braves

454750 oh boy those westerners are so vulgarly uninhibited even on camera and in the streets how bad they must be when nobody is watching
454751 the team has done a fantastic job of continually improving the car over the past few weeks so i m really proud of what we ve achieved today it s great to have locked out the front row with heikki we ve been threatening to do it for a number of races so to achieve it at a track where it s tricky to pass is really satisfying there s a great harmony within the team at the moment and we really deserved this i couldn t ask to be in a better position we ve both got good strategies for tomorrow and we ll be challenging for the win
454752 it was difficult to choose the right tyre for the final session and i felt i could have done a slightly faster lap in q3 but i was a little cautious in turn two still we ve found a great direction with the car and i ve got a great opportunity to win the race tomorrow it s fantastic to be starting on the front row alongside lewis i hope that starting on the dirty side of the track won t be a disadvantage and i fully expect us to look out for each other in the first corner tomorrow this result really repays the team for all its efforts over the past few months
454753 todays all vodafone mclaren mercedes front row is a fitting tribute to the phenomenal amount of hard work carried out by the whole team in the lead up to the 2008 hungarian grand prix we brought to budapest the developments that were originally destined to be incorporated into our valencia spec car and the signs are that it has been an effective move a qualifying one two is a rare and pleasing achievement so i want to say a big thank you to all the people who worked so hard to make it possible and that includes everyone in woking mclaren in brixworth mercedes benz highperformanceengines and of course in stuttgart mercedes benz now we hope to convert our excellent qualifying performance into an equally solid race result
454754 a great performance by lewis heikki and our team a dream and our third pole in a row one from heikki two from lewis i hope we will be able to turn our grid positions into a similar result in the race tomorrow
454755 we dont index every one of those trillion pages many of them are similar to each other or represent auto generated content similar to the calendar example that isnt very useful to searchers but were proud to have the most comprehensive index of any search engine and our goal always has been to index all the worlds data
454756 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
454757 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
454758 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
454759 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
454760 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
454761 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
454762 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
454763 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
454764 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
454765 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
454766 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
454767 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
454768 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
454769 while i personally own both next gen consoles it appears that the demo will only work on the blu ray capable sony ps3 this news may sting the xbox 360 owners who only recently found out that they too would be able to play final fantasy xiii on their console of course theres still a chance that microsoft will throw a few bucks in the direction of square enix and get themselves a demo as well but as of right now it appears that sony ps3 owners once again have the upper hand in the battle of ff supremacy
454770 those expecting any bombshell announcements from this years quakecon keynote may have to wait for another time

454772 if there are two games that all people agree were out of this world on the sega dreamcast it would be shenmue and shenmue 2 both created by legendary developer yu suzuki the game had amazing depth freedom and interactivity capped off with a gripping storyline and incredible characters so it comes as no wonder that so many shenmue fans want the story finished this past week hope rose from the ashes just to go up in flames again all in the matter of a couple of days

454774 the guys at arstechnica have recently done their part to help rekindle the feud between mortal kombat and street fighter years ago when mortal kombat was shiny new and very gory ed boon and capcom had quite the verbal sparring match at this years comic con it looks as if boon is not ready to hang up his gloves quite yet when asked by eurogamer if mortal kombat versus dc universe was still in the running against the street fighter series boon had this to say i think just from the history we do i think well kick their ass were a wilder ride a big rollercoaster ride and theyre a little bit tamer capcom community manager seth killian had this when prompted at capcoms booth you cant touch the mechanics of street fighter and sfiv is really channeling back the classic mechanics that ignited the world mortal kombat was riding the coattails of street fighter then and i think mortal kombat may be riding the tails of street fighter as we move into 2009 personally im a bigger mortal kombat fan street fighter iv is looking very smooth but ill take split punches and spears over fireballs any day of the week what do you guys prefer

454782 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
454783 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
454784 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
454785 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
454786 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
454787 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
454788 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
454789 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
454790 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
454791 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
454792 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
454793 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
454794 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
454795 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
454796 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
454797 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
454798 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
454799 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
454800 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
454801 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
454802 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

454825 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
454826 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

454828 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
454829 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
454830 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
454831 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
454832 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
454833 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
454834 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
454835 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
454836 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
454837 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
454838 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
454839 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
454840 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
454841 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
454842 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
454843 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
454844 la connaissance cest lexp rience que fait lhomme de lunit qui unit tous les hommes
454845 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
454846 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market

455077 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
455078 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
455079 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab sent by a top u s army scientist at ft detrick without resorting to any speculation or inferences at all it is hard to overstate the significance of that fact from the beginning there was a clear intent on the part of the anthrax attacker to create a link between the anthrax attacks and both islamic radicals and the 9 11 attacks

455081 i hated this piece of trash whoever liked it is an idiot with awful taste
455082 no matter what women achieve some people apparently still see them as sex objects
455083 the public response to sam newmans latest outburst shows that most people appreciate how stupid and shallow his comments are
455084 sam operates outside the boundary of good taste like most people i find the comments highly inappropriate
455085 paulas a fantastic person and she just doesnt deserve it
455086 he just wants to attract attention it cant be anything else and i dont think he is going to change
455087 it seems as if he is in pursuit of infamy and if thats the case perhaps he should be taken off air people find him offensive and inappropriate
455088 nine management should really pull sam newman in and tell him what is and what isnt appropriate in terms of his role on tv

455104 its okay ill stand make this quick i dont want emma to see us here
455105 emmas 18 now and kids her age dont have imaginary friends anymore for how long do you intend to stay here anyway they grow up and soon they will have to send you back with force you cant hang around them all the time its in your contract

455109 rock band live brings together a terrific combination of artists for a night of rock n roll love
455110 the bands are fantastic the timing dovetails perfectly with the release of rock band 2 and the events will be tons of interactive fun for families
455111 and what better way to celebrate our involvement with the game than joining the first rock band tour were definitely excited to be a part of things
455112 with any luck ill win a spot on stage to show what i can really do
455113 it is important to have a strong opposition that is keeping you on your toes giving you a hard time and calling you out if you are not doing what you say your gonna to do
455114 its almost a self fulfilling prophecy we make a prediction about what kind of relationship we could have with a person and that helps determine how much effort we are willing to put into developing a relationship
455115 if i think we could become friends ill communicate more tell you more about myself and do things that will help ensure a friendship does develop
455116 if i have a more negative prediction about a future relationship then i will restrict communication and make it harder to develop
455117 earlier research had assumed there was a cumulative effect that happens in the first days of meeting that helps determine how relationships will develop
455118 but were finding that it all happens much sooner than that literally within a few minutes
455119 ive enjoyed it i wouldnt want to be back to it but it did bring back memories of hard days and good days and many laughs and many characters who were drivers
455120 at adelaide station in belfast we worked the 9 30 passenger express train from belfast to dublin and back and on that journey one day i burned 10 tonne of coal shovelled it when we came back to belfast that night we had nothing left
455121 we used to do that in bundoran we used to have a fry up you couldnt have got very much in the north at that particular time and when you went down there you got plenty of sausages
455122 a lot of passengers in those days were young people coming from the west of ireland going to london
455123 single to euston station was 3 pound 8 shillings and 9 pence that sticks in my memory
455124 perhaps i should have had an abortion youre such a pain but it was slick and fast with racy dialogue and genuinely risqu moments
455125 te lavevo detto che senza di te non avrei mai potuto vivere
455126 the church has long been concerned about the continued illegal practice of polygamy and in particular about reports of child and wife abuse emanating from polygamous communities today
455127 it will be regrettable if this programme by making polygamy the subject of entertainment minimises the seriousness of the problem
455128 placing the series in salt lake city the international headquarters of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints is enough to blur the line between the modern church and the programmes subject matter and to reinforce old and long outdated stereotypes
455129 big love like so much other television programming is essentially lazy and indulgent entertainment that does nothing for our society and will never nourish great mind
455130 i think what the show does very clearly is it makes a very big distinction between the mainline church and the characters in the show
455131 it is interesting how many people are ignorant about the mormon church and think that the morman church actually does condone polygamy
455132 so in an odd way the show is sort of beneficial in drawing that distinction
455133 its kind of an interesting idea to take this kind of taboo thing yet examine the human condition through it
455134 really in much of the way that james gandolfini is in the sopranos im a guy 40 something whos struggling with his business and with his family life it just happens to be an unorthodox family with three wives
455135 its a quandary we find ourselves in that i havent really experienced watching television before
455136 some episodes are almost sitcom like other scenes are far more subtle and sophisticated
455137 you can watch it and be interested in what is going on and find what theyre saying about family life and family culture and the 21st century interesting
455138 but its not like an episode of 24 where at the end you want to see the next episode immediately
455139 it is a more subtle animal than that which is a good thing and may also be to its detriment
455140 we will have to listen to those concerns and respond to them
455141 i think the government is going to have to make a number of changes to its approach to the bill to be sure of getting it through
455142 i think the scale of unhappiness is wider than the number of people who rebelled last night
455143 setting communities free from criminality and the influence of paramilitaries will not just happen of its own accord or overnight
455144 it needs to be worked for and those who have shown that they are committed to doing that and have ideas about how it can be done deserve support
455145 there are many within loyalism who want to break from the past it is right that those who are genuinely engaged in efforts to move their organisations away from paramilitary activity and criminality should be supported in that work
455146 recognises the need for a process involving loyalism and will assist them in working with other agencies community groups and public bodies
455147 it is important that this money is used for the right reasons and over the course of this six month project the sdlp will be monitoring how it is used to better the lives of people living in deprived areas
455148 public money into certain loyalist communities at the expense of other areas where greater levels of actual need exist
455149 they were the unwanted of the unwanted but i could not turn my back on them
455150 but i was always aware that the situation in wales was pretty bad and for a long while i wanted to do something there
455151 it went pretty well but i was left with 19 animals and there was no way i was going to see them killed
455152 the only thing to do was to bring them with us
455153 it was all very costly and no doubt people will think about all the good we could have done for other animals for the same amount of money
455154 but when you have seen as much suffering as we have then sometimes you just have to say to yourself that you are going to do some good and to hell with the cost
455155 todo lo que ten a lo gastaba en apostar usaba todo mi salario todo lo que ganaba iba a los casinos lo perd todo

455166 at primary school there appears to be a good balance looking at the needs of the whole person
455167 but secondary school teachers ive spoken to say they are run more like factories
455168 the high demands of league tables and targets must have some effect
455169 we are asking for broader thinking about what is taught in schools
455170 we need to look not at just vocational teaching in terms of achieving an end like employment or exam success we have to ask what is school actually preparing people for

455259 los marxistas aspiran al comunismo y a la igualdad de clases a causa de su inferioridad de la que seguramente tienen conciencia y por ello se consideran incapaces de prosperar mediante el trabajo y el esfuerzo personal si se quiere la igualdad de clases no es por el af n de superarse sino de que desciendan a su nivel aquellos que poseen un puesto social destacado sea adquirido o heredado
455260 ive been told by sources close to the packers quarterback that hes developed serious apprehensions about accepting this deal because it fails to achieve his primary objective in unretiring which is getting back and playing football again

455263 there is a place i want to go to but i dont know where there is someone i want to meet but i dont know who

455265 it is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves
455266 these are good results and we feel were on track to reach the 12 000 goal
455267 ivins would have stood to make tens of thousands of dollars but not millions
455268 it will depend on the business arrangements that are in place
455269 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers
455270 it is our understanding that there are discussions ongoing within law enforcement as to whether the fbi will become involved
455271 only in the last week or so have we confirmed that in fact there are no tickets coming through
455272 we have seen no evidence that anyone has received any tickets the best that we can tell its blatant fraud
455273 i actually tried to expose them way back in february to newspapers and also to the beijing olympics committee
455274 it seems like no one took it seriously until now
455275 if i failed to recognize this internet scam very few other individuals with less of an e commerce background would have had a chance
455276 so i can empathize with others in the same position
455277 ive been in business for 18 years im aware that theres fraud out there
455278 but they looked so legitimate their website was so elaborate
455279 i work for a fairly large software company and the team i manage is responsible for dealing with internet crime
455280 so it was quite amusing to everyone at work that i had been scammed on the internet
455281 the important point im making by talking about this is that this was a bloody good scam
455282 its like one of those boiler room deals in the stock market the huge office and all these people and at the last second they simply shut it down
455283 when we write a name on our list it comes from the families
455284 in 1998 when syria released 151 lebanese we had only four names out of the whole amount
455285 and in 2000 when they released 54 we had only 12 names out of the whole package so this is a clear indication of how many people might be there that we dont know about
455286 i say to the families of those missing and those detained that he who has been patient for 30 years can wait a bit longer
455287 we dont have a legal mechanism in lebanon to identify who was taken by the syrians and who was killed by local militias
455288 thats why we met the president and told him we should have a new commission based on international norms

455531 i am now a total tomato junkie and heirlooms are my crack wow who knew they came in so many different flavors and colors yellow green striped whatevers ripe and available i cant resist
455532 heirloom tomatoes stand out of the crowd for their so called ugliness they also stand out from the other mass produced automatoes because they appear to have a soul that sweet expression of compassion tinged with sorrow carved onto their little face can only be interpreted as a deep concern for the dismal state of things in the world like most of us they arent aware of their own deliciousness but they differ in the fact that they surrender to their fate without a hint of resistance and their fate is to be on our plates my friends zen is all about seeing deeply into the nature of things by direct experience therefore a zen chef should seek to embellish heirloom tomatoes without masking their perfect taste he should also be fully present as he prepares them

455534 i think that everyone that lives in british columbia hopefully will take a moment to think about how lucky we are to live here
455535 i cant think of a place in the world where id rather live than british columbia
455536 you just have to travel to other parts of the country let alone other parts of the world to recognize that we are really really fortunate to call ourselves citizens of british columbia
455537 an act to provide for the government of british columbia

455542 im extremely disappointed that having returned to training i now have to undergo further surgery

455544 shouldnt be allowed to own a computer let alone have a blog
455545 blogger most likely to vote for a donkey if you slapped the correct colour rosette on it
455546 he will also be cheered up by coming third in
455547 after the 11th i was hoping to get to 5 or 6 under and still have a chance
455548 today was a little better more regular golf i missed a few shots here and there but i kept going and when you hole a shot like that on the 11th it keeps the momentum going
455549 what was really special was coming down the last eight with that great support teeing up so early compared with leaders we still had a huge crowd and it was very special coming up 18 i hope it will be like that tomorrow
455550 im here im enjoying myself im focused on my game i havent changed anything my routines are the same i have the same coach and caddy
455551 they made a bid and we didnt accept it but phil gartside bolton chairman got in contact and asked whether we could do a straight swap
455552 abraham lincoln in a past life had been a yogi in the himalayas

455554 he would remain in the custody of the federal government pending an indictment or the filing of a bill of information

455556 thats a storybook ending right there manny getting traded here and coming up representing the winning run
455557 but brandon made some quality pitches and got the double play hes done his job pretty well all year
455558 i was just trying to see the ball and hit it he made a good pitch and got me out but tomorrows another day
455559 my mechanics have fallen into place over the last three or four games and im able to throw all of my pitches over for strikes now and stay away from the big inning
455560 throwing first pitch strikes i had some easy innings and it allowed me to stay out there
455561 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
455562 i think theyre cynical and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
455563 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
455564 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
455565 what that means is were going to have to try to get things done
455566 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
455567 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
455568 i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races for a whole range of reasons
455569 im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama im african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i dont have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
455570 youve got statistics that say weve lost another 50 000 jobs that florida is in a recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about was paris and britney
455571 theyre clever on creating distractions from the issues that really matter in peoples lives
455572 weve got to make sure we keep focused on peoples day to day concerns we dont take the skill of the republicans in engaging in negative campaigning lightly
455573 at some point people are going to have to make decisions are we going to keep arguing or are we going to get things done
455574 what i dont want to do is for the best to be the enemy of the good
455575 and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then thats something im open to
455576 they made a living through the depression for all of us

455581 my concern is that people sitting in their homes already know what the pain is i want to make sure albany does
455582 let me be honest this situation will get worse before it gets better
455583 this may be the most severe economic downturn since the depression
455584 before the storm broke we were steadily gaining in prosperity advances in science and invention opened vast vistas of new progress being prosperous we became optimistic all of us from optimism some of us went to over expansion in anticipation of the future and from over expansion to reckless speculation and abuse of financial power
455585 new blows with decreasing world consumption of goods and from failing financial institutions rained upon our people
455586 the worldwide storm grew rapidly to hurricane force and the greatest economic emergency in all the history of the world unexpected unforeseen violent shocks with every month brought new dangers and new emergencies to our country fear and apprehension gripped the heart of our people in every village and city
455587 it is not the function of the government to relieve individuals of their responsibilities to their neighbours or to relieve private institutions of their responsibilities to the public or the local government to the states or the responsibilities of state government to the federal government where it becomes necessary to meet emergencies beyond the power of these agencies by the creation of new government instrumentalities that they should be of such character as not to supplant or weaken but rather to supplement and strengthen the initiative and enterprise of our people
455588 you speak english so well to which i reply gee thanks so do you

455600 i have done various films where i have played important roles i have done special appearances played supporting actress or was one of the two or more heroines but this is my film where i am the solo heroine
455601 i find comedy the most difficult thing to do i dont have many comic scenes to perform in the film as i am playing a middle class girl who is the sister of under world don played by mithun chakraborty
455602 i had one of my best experiences of working with sachin yardi and i think he has taken the best out of me as ritu da rituparno ghosh does
455603 ritu da has taught me various aspects of acting and it is from him that i grew as an actor

455611 the hitting streak has been a mainstay with major league and high softball clubs for years it throws wicked breaking balls fastballs and change ups switching quickly from one pitch to another in seconds and its portable enough to set up anywhere at the field in the tunnel in the gym or any other hitting area because it exclusively uses the sft and sft supersoft balls bp can be taken in all types of environments but just because its lightweight and portable doesnt mean that its not a durable reliable unit sturdy steel construction and a rugged powder coat finish make the hitting streak an essential part of your training regimen

455615 monica monica boy we are going to miss having you around here
455616 as we went deeper into the woods i stayed behind to capture a shot of the whole group walking off i suddenly became transfixed and mesmerised by the wall of trees behind me
455617 i felt so good and so peaceful that i actually forgot my camera entirely i was told only just last week by the lama who was leading the group that it was only when he looked back for me that he saw that i was completely surrounded by spirits and was just about to be possessed
455618 by breaking away from the group i had left the protective shield that is around to keep everyone safe
455619 in recent weeks thousands of wal mart store managers and department heads have been summoned to mandatory meetings at which the retailer stresses the downside for workers if stores were to be unionized
455620 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
455621 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
455622 last week i am wondering what kind of relationship he is looking for on that site is he single now just curious
455623 after the 11th i was hoping to get to 5 or 6 under and still have a chance
455624 today was a little better more regular golf i missed a few shots here and there but i kept going and when you hole a shot like that on the 11th it keeps the momentum going
455625 what was really special was coming down the last eight with that great support teeing up so early compared with leaders we still had a huge crowd and it was very special coming up 18 i hope it will be like that tomorrow

455630 were encouraged by the broad bipartisan commitment to fully fund and maintain u s leadership in the fight against global aids tb and malaria but theres still more work to do to strengthen comprehensive evidence based hiv aids prevention programming under pepfar
455631 the new legislation improves key aspects of current law including provisions that reinforce the need to address gender and the status of women enhance linkages between hiv aids and food security and other development programming expand support for pediatric aids initiatives and orphans and vulnerable children programming and establish new flexibility to address the hiv travel ban
455632 but the president can make the bill even stronger by implementing its new provisions so that we prioritize prevention
455633 care also noted the persistent need to focus on gender and empowerment of women as a strategy for reducing hiv risk and the impact of aids on vulnerable people and the tough but important job of fully integrating
455634 despite its strengths the new law also misses key opportunities and care identified several priority areas where lawmakers and administrators still have work to do
455635 care looks forward to working with the pepfar program under the newly reauthorized law but it is essential that we strengthen and prioritize prevention and more comprehensive integrated approaches in order to build on and advance the important progress that the program has already achieved
455636 good morning this is congressman henry waxman of california chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee
455637 this was a great week in the house of representatives for the children of america
455638 over the last eight years the key federal agencies responsible for protecting the public health have been muzzled
455639 when the science says that products that babies put into their mouths could be a threat to their health the safety commission is supposed to act but they did nothing
455640 too often our watchdog agencies have been captured by special interests and the people put in charge have been republican cronies who have had little experience or interest in their government duties remember fema and hurricane katrina
455641 but this week congress said the public interest must come first
455642 we also finally stood up to the tobacco companies fourteen years ago i chaired the hearings at which the tobacco company ceos swore under oath that nicotine was not addictive cigarettes did not cause disease and they did not target our children well they of course lied
455643 when the republicans took control of the congress in the next year and controlled it for the next 12 years efforts on tobacco were stopped
455644 but last year democrats regained the majority in the house and house speaker nancy pelosi made taking on the tobacco companies a top priority and this week we achieved an important milestone
455645 with strong bipartisan support we passed long overdue legislation to stop advertising and promotions targeted to our kids to stop the marketing of candy flavored cigarettes clearly designed to attract our kids to smoking to give the fda the power to both regulate marketing and the manufacture of tobacco products to make sure that we can remove dangerous additives like formaldehyde and ammonia and begin the process of figuring out how to make cigarettes less addictive
455646 tobacco is the only product that when its used as intended kills every day 1 000 kids take up this deadly habit and each year over 400 000 americans die from smoking
455647 i am proud to say that the house has finally passed legislation to protect our children from tobacco addiction and its devastating toll of death and disease
455648 we are in the final months of president bushs last term but through our legislative efforts we are giving the next administration the tools it will need to start putting public health and especially the health of our children first
455649 government at its best can work it was a very good week for the american public and best of all it was a very good week for our kids

455652 by making informed choices travelers can support conservation and avoid having their souvenirs confiscated at the airport
455653 cites regulates trade worldwide in more than 30 000 different animal and plant species
455654 travelers need to ask questions and check trade restrictions before they buy
455655 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
455656 thats such a shame especially for the ones who were clean and its most important for the athletes who were second
455657 you lose that opportunity to stand on top of the podium and feel the joy of winning the race those are the people who hurt the worst when there are cheaters ahead of them giving back the medals is just a technicality because you cant repair the hurt feelings and the hard work that went into it
455658 today we have absolutely no concerns about the organization no regrets come the 9th of august the opening day of competition the magic of the games and the flawless organization will take over
455659 im not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for
455660 we are not running the internet in china chinese authorities are running the internet in china
455661 if we allow political propaganda its the end of the harmony of the olympic village and the end of the harmony of the games

455663 we want to render justice when all the factors are known
455664 in the midterm or in a few months im sure everything will be finalized and those athletes who are clean will be rewarded
455665 the fault now lies on many shoulders and i fear that incompetence laziness and deceit may have played a role kirk wrote on her
455666 that is much harder to take regardless of intent mistakes were made and i am paying for them
455667 people i trusted to do their jobs and to ensure the working order of the system we put in place for our sport failed me

455671 at around 13 50 we received a call to dunclug park about an assault on two members of sinn fein
455672 we are investigating the allegations police believe the incident was a reaction by a small number of people in the area to a multi agency approach to the removal of bonfire material
455673 investigations have since found that the auspure biotechnology co did illegally smuggle and sell doping formulas

455685 it was a very good week for the american public
455686 its stunning democrats would claim to have a great week after failing to vote on let alone pass an energy plan on the no 1 issue facing most americans gas prices the democrats in congress have failed to deliver any relief
455687 the safety commission failed to protect children against dangerous levels of lead in toys and it did nothing to stop the use of dangerous chemicals in plastic toys

455709 i am obviously very happy at the network and city homicide is doing great but i was hungry i was hungry for more
455710 i reckon my appetite will be pretty well fulfilled at the end of this
455711 the opportunity to be in the no 1 drama in the country and potentially the no 1 variety show simultaneously was just an offer that i could not refuse and it was a challenge i could not walk away from
455712 the thrill satisfaction and reward i got from the live component of x factor prompted us macpherson and his management to spend about 12 to 18 months developing and shopping around a live variety show
455713 that was sort of the direction we were heading and then tripping over came along and then city homicide came along and some opportunities in the states popped up
455714 i reckon somebody has told them how bad a dancer i am
455715 this is a timeless story about young people struggling to break free of authority

455729 we knew that the qualifying session would be very close and that proved to be the case
455730 the session was very competitive and more difficult than i though it would be in the end i managed to reach q3 and i am happy about that it means we can approach the race sensibly tomorrow and i hope we can make the most of this grid position to score some points
455731 as always the homework done during our free practice sessions has paid off by getting both cars into the final part of qualifying with fuel loads that we believe can help us have a competitive race as everybody knows it is really difficult to pass on this track and so after a good qualifying session pit stops are now of extreme importance
455732 obviously we cannot be happy with this result especially when our main opponents have the front row to themselves
455733 our main aim this weekend was and still is to get the most out of our car tyre team package and today we failed to do that especially in the final part of qualifying now we have to try and do it in tomorrows race it will be tough because our grid positions are not the best and we are up against very strong opposition but it is not an impossible task we have strong potential which we saw today it will be a case of getting all the elements to come together as well as possible
455734 its a shame i didnt manage to get the best out of the car in q3 mainly because of traffic especially on my second run in the first two parts of qualifying the car felt good as can be seen from my times but then i never managed to prepare the tyres in the best way clearly overtaking isnt easy but we have a good pace and i will try and exploit that in fighting with the two drivers ahead of me on the grid
455735 i made a mistake on my final flying lap which cost me precious time and that followed on from not having got a great lap on my previous attempt which explains why im sixth of course i am not happy and starting from the third row my race will be an uphill struggle i will try and make the most of this situation given that the car today was not that bad we are going through a bit of a difficult time but we mustnt give up all we need to do is put together all the pieces of the jigsaw and then the results will come to us again

455739 you dont die over a broken heart you only wish you did
455740 you never know what you have lost till you are standing in a room with that person not being able to call them yours
455741 there are few things sadder in life then watching someone walk away after they left you watching the distance between your bodies expand until there is nothing left but empty space and silence
455742 sometimes when you hold out for everything you walk away with nothing
455743 instead of thinking about what youre missing try thinking about what you have that everyone else is missing
455744 the team has done a fantastic job of continually improving the car over the past few weeks so im really proud of what weve achieved today its great to have locked out the front row with heikki weve been threatening to do it for a number of races so to achieve it at a track where its tricky to pass is really satisfying theres a great harmony within the team at the moment and we really deserved this i couldnt ask to be in a better position weve both got good strategies for tomorrow and well be challenging for the win
455745 it was difficult to choose the right tyre for the final session and i felt i could have done a slightly faster lap in q3 but i was a little cautious in turn two still weve found a great direction with the car and ive got a great opportunity to win the race tomorrow its fantastic to be starting on the front row alongside lewis i hope that starting on the dirty side of the track wont be a disadvantage and i fully expect us to look out for each other in the first corner tomorrow this result really repays the team for all its efforts over the past few months

455752 and jennifer rankines attendance today is a sign of confidence the government will follow up some of the initiatives created by the summit
455753 sometimes i worry about my future because there are not enough people out there to hire you
455754 i really hope something positive comes out of the summit
455755 you drive through some suburbs and there is a pride in that suburb you drive through others and it would be a challenge to drive through them we have to change that perception
455756 it will take money take time and it wont happen tomorrow but its got to start somewhere the summit is a good place to start because it gets people talking what will come out of today is a push about the positives
455757 i would warmly welcome it if he would stay in the parliament return to the frontbench and re engage with politics
455758 and after that mr phelps will leap a tall building in a single bound
455759 once i get to competition its like its like im in a cage so just let me out because i know exactly what to do i know how to prepare myself i know how to warm up i know how to get my head in the game competition is my favorite part of the sport thats what i do best
455760 you have to be tougher meaner if you dont have a base of strength and stamina you fade you die
455761 yeah hes one of a kind he and i work out at the same place in arizona in the off season and ive seen him call out nfl players during ping pong games asking them when theyre starting jenny craig he told brady quinn who is a monster a physical specimen im going to rip this ball right out of your throat hes a piece of work
455762 a wonderful architectural ensemble of a new socialist type reflecting the creative might of the soviet people inspired by the great ideas of building communism
455763 its not much honey just a little oil for your lamp
455764 your heart and my heart are very very old friends
455765 weve maintained an over allocation to the international equity markets since 2003 but this trend has weakened over the last quarter
455766 this is the first time ive seen the model favoring domestic markets over international markets
455767 we believe emerging markets are still going to offer better value over the long term than the domestic markets and those of other developed nations worldwide
455768 were importing inflation from india and china because their demand for commodities has dramatically increased over the last three years and we dont believe it will abate any time soon
455769 we expect the economies to keep pace but believe the profit margins will come under pressure as we dont see any opportunity to squeeze any more from the current variables that has been a challenge in the u s as well as in europe and other developed countries but we think its going to start to be a challenge even for the emerging economies
455770 will require an infrastructure build out on a scale and a timeline perhaps unparalleled in the world
455771 the report breathlessly blathers how sick i am of this weenie grandiosity to some so un reachable and so massively incomprehensible goal in scale jesus one would think americans had never collectively solved a problem before
455772 what were the odds that florida was going to be within a thousandth of one percent
455773 its going to be close enough that a tie is definitely possible if its close its possible it becomes closer to 2 percent
455774 new mexico tends to mirror the national polls so when you see a national poll showing obama up 4 to 6 points thats a pretty good indicator
455775 the question is can obama resonate among hispanic democrats and rural democrats can he be seen as a regular guy
455776 if you go to a supermarket here theres a decent chance an obama worker is going to ask you to register to vote i think obama has a lead but i wouldnt bet a lot of money on it
455777 its something to almost prepare for and think through because it would really be a disaster
455778 i have become a symbol of restoring america to its best traditions
455779 the school foundation urged us to intervene to protect people
455780 we are delighted to have worked with zs fund and the management team of industrial air tool to complete this transaction
455781 together with ge we were also able to deliver a unitranche loan and provide a one stop debt solution to the transaction with speed simplicity and certainty to close
455782 oh my god you are not one of those weirdos that does low carb are you
455783 well honey you are considerably younger than i am how old are you 30 at my age 42 this is as good as it gets
455784 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
455785 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
455786 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
455787 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
455788 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
455789 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
455790 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
455791 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
455792 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering
455793 bozo your ad hominem comment directed against professor mesler is not only out of line
455794 were spending 1 trillion a year on the war department
455795 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
455796 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
455797 i guarantee you if id have showed up there and theyd have said you cant come in just by yourself and with your maybe a senate one of your staff id have gone nuts i would have called the secretary of defense and said secretary gates i want to visit these people instead apparently sen obama decided to go to the gym at the ritz
455798 though realizing that many other factors were involved i reasoned that if we could get a freer flow of trade freer in the sense of fewer discriminations and obstructions so that one country would not be deadly jealous of another and the living standards of all countries might rise thereby eliminating the economic dissatisfaction that breeds war we might have a reasonable chance for lasting peace
455799 the greatest act of political courage that i have ever witnessed
455800 the commonwealth cannot afford to ignore the negative effects of global warming and climate change any longer
455801 sea temperatures continue to rise storm intensity is predicted to heighten and our economy the publics health and our precious ecosystem are in jeopardy
455802 if global warming and climate change continue to remain unchecked in the commonwealth the cost of inaction will be in the billions
455803 we can effectively end our reliance on fossil fuels by aggressively increasing our reliance on renewable energy sources solar wind geothermal
455804 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
455805 the greenhouse gas reductions goals laid out in this bill are exceedingly aggressive perhaps to the point of being unattainable and could only be achieved through greatly increased costs for consumers and for employers
455806 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us
455807 green homes are shining through as the bright spot in an otherwise gloomy housing market
455808 this twin crisis of peak oil and climate change is spurring innovation experimentation and excitement
455809 these big challenges are what the u s is best at frankly
455810 by providing guidelines and strategies in essence our job is to keep saying yes its possible heres how
455811 there are a zillion different codes and standards out there
455812 we want to make it much easier for people to adopt our goals
455813 our core competencies traditionally have been in the area of specialized low volume electronics and production of direction finding antennas
455814 this new facility allows us to take that expertise and adapt it to other types of work for a broader client base
455815 having manufacturing facilities equipment staff and processes in place to transition swri designs into deployable equipment offers our clients a one stop shop to meet their needs
455816 providing end item units also allows us to maintain contact with our clients by providing field support spares repairs and upgrades
455817 quality systems model for quality assurance in design develop production installation and servicing
455818 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
455819 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
455820 war is the supreme test of man in which he rises to heights never approached in any other activity
455821 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
455822 in this course attendees will receive instruction as to how the extended features of visual basic can be used to overcome difficulties encountered when working with disparate data sources within their organizations
455823 if i listened to what every bitch in new york city said about me id never leave the house
455824 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
455825 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
455826 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
455827 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
455828 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
455829 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
455830 beware of those powers which come from god but which can so easily be purloined by the devil
455831 a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural or exceptional powers or qualities
455832 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
455833 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
455834 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
455835 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
455836 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
455837 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
455838 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
455839 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
455840 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
455841 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
455842 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
455843 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
455844 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
455845 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
455846 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
455847 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
455848 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
455849 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
455850 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
455851 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
455852 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
455853 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
455854 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
455855 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
455856 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
455857 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
455858 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
455859 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
455860 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
455861 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
455862 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
455863 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
455864 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
455865 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
455866 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
455867 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
455868 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
455869 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
455870 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
455871 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
455872 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
455873 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
455874 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
455875 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
455876 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
455877 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
455878 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
455879 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
455880 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
455881 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
455882 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
455883 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
455884 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
455885 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
455886 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
455887 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
455888 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
455889 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
455890 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
455891 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
455892 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
455893 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
455894 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
455895 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
455896 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
455897 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
455898 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
455899 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
455900 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
455901 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
455902 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
455903 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
455904 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
455905 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
455906 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
455907 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
455908 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
455909 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
455910 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
455911 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
455912 if i listened to what every bitch in new york city said about me id never leave the house
455913 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
455914 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
455915 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
455916 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
455917 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
455918 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
455919 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
455920 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
455921 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
455922 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
455923 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
455924 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
455925 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
455926 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
455927 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
455928 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
455929 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
455930 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
455931 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
455932 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
455933 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
455934 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
455935 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
455936 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
455937 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
455938 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
455939 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
455940 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
455941 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
455942 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
455943 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
455944 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
455945 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
455946 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
455947 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
455948 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
455949 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
455950 sounds like a gimmick to take advantage of this phony baloney scheme that al gore hatched to fill his own pockets with
455951 stick it on the tailpipe of every car out there
455952 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
455953 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
455954 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
455955 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
455956 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
455957 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
455958 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
455959 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
455960 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
455961 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
455962 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
455963 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
455964 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
455965 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
455966 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
455967 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
455968 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
455969 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
455970 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
455971 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
455972 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
455973 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
455974 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
455975 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
455976 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
455977 if i listened to what every bitch in new york city said about me id never leave the house
455978 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
455979 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
455980 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
455981 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
455982 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
455983 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
455984 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
455985 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
455986 so what theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama you know hes new he doesnt look like the other presidents on the currency hes got a funny name i mean thats basically the argument hes too risky

455992 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
455993 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
455994 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
455995 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
455996 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
455997 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
455998 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
455999 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
456000 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
456001 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
456002 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
456003 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
456004 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
456005 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
456006 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
456007 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
456008 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
456009 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
456010 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
456011 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
456012 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
456013 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
456014 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
456015 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
456016 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
456017 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
456018 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
456019 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
456020 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
456021 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
456022 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
456023 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
456024 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
456025 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
456026 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
456027 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
456028 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
456029 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
456030 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer

456035 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
456036 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
456037 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
456038 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
456039 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
456040 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
456041 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
456042 but how will i be my moms kid without my mom i still feel like im 12 years old sometimes
456043 honey youre being irrational youll always have a mother alive or dead yay scooters face doesnt smell like cat butt anymore
456044 theres someone who has psychiatric problems who needs to go to the hospital
456045 we are at the end of the line as far as funds available to buy property
456046 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
456047 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
456048 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
456049 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
456050 they should be punished as mohareb enemy of god and corrupt on the earth
456051 if this bill is adopted there will be further infringement of the freedom of expression citizens judicial security will be jeopardized and executions will increase
456052 it will be up to the court to recognize corruption and apostasy so it will jeopardies the lives of those who are guilty only of writing
456053 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
456054 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
456055 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
456056 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
456057 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
456058 you know its not about you its about your country
456059 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
456060 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
456061 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
456062 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
456063 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
456064 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
456065 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
456066 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
456067 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
456068 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
456069 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
456070 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
456071 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
456072 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
456073 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
456074 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
456075 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
456076 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
456077 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
456078 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
456079 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
456080 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
456081 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
456082 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
456083 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
456084 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
456085 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
456086 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
456087 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
456088 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
456089 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
456090 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
456091 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
456092 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
456093 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
456094 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
456095 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
456096 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
456097 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
456098 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
456099 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
456100 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
456101 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
456102 planning is bringing the future into the present so that you can do something about it now
456103 it s a bad bad situation and it s getting more absurd

456109 hey what s that smell the tour is expected to kick off later this year
456110 there is no question that the rolling stones are one of the most important bands in music history their musical style and off stage swagger have been emulated by countless others having worked closely with them during my days at atlantic records i am thrilled to be reunited with these seminal musicians who have set the bar for all rock bands in their path i couldn t be happier that they ve chosen umg as their partner for what will certainly be the next chapter in their already storied career
456111 rock stars in their sixties who carry with them a great catalog
456112 i m not even allowed to go see r rated movies
456113 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
456114 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didn t they heed me before it was too late
456115 steve meyer is on the front line of global music sales and distribution which he expects will soar to pocket bursting levels
456116 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
456117 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
456118 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
456119 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
456120 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
456121 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
456122 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means

456130 the economy is partly to blame for the closings but there are other culprits namely african americans in milwaukee who regularly complain about the lack of institutions yet fail to support what they do have at the moment
456131 the party leadership will be apprised on the national campaign agreed upon by the unpa left parties combine the state assembly elections will form the backdrop for cementing the national campaign against price rise indo us deal farmers issue and others

456137 i cant think of a place in the world where id rather live than british columbia

456142 chrysler llc today announced that in spite of the severe economic and industry challenges we continue to perform ahead of our financial plan for the second quarter and first half of 2008
456143 the company measures its financial performance against two primary financial metrics cash marketable securities and ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and restructuring charges
456144 the company remains ahead of its financial plan due primarily to chryslers fast response to the deteriorating market conditions and its cost reduction initiatives launched in 2007 focused largely on restructuring its operations
456145 chryslers negative product mix largely driven by trucks and suvs was off set in the first half with a positive mix which includes the effects from substantially reduced fleet sales the effects of new products the all new chrysler and dodge minivans dodge journey and jeep liberty and the elimination of unprofitable models chrysler pt cruiser convertible pacifica and crossfire and the dodge magnum
456146 in july we saw strong performance once again in our launch products including the cadillac cts chevrolet malibu saturn astra and pontiac vibe and g8 in addition we continued to see strong retail demand for our fuel efficient chevrolet aveo and hhr saturn vue and buick enclave so despite an overall weak market there are pockets of strength
456147 obviously the weakness in the truck market persisted in july yet we continue to hold share due to our fuel economy leadership in many truck segments despite dramatic competitive incentive spending increases
456148 were working hard to change perceptions and gain awareness of gm as the leader in advanced propulsion technology and fuel efficiency
456149 customers can experience that each time they visit a dealers showroom to see the full lineup including five hybrid models that provide industry leading value great fuel economy and the best warranty coverage of any full line automaker we dont just talk about technology fuel efficiency and value we have the cars and trucks available today to back it up
456150 our luxury certified pre owned programs cadillac saab and hummer certified pre owned vehicles each posted strong sales increases last month and gm certified used vehicles is again setting the pace to lead the segment in sales this year
456151 were confident more shoppers will seek the quality and value that manufacturer certification offers
456152 it came to me what if he comes out and extorts me and blackmails me or tells people
456153 i couldnt believe that somebody would do that to any human being
456154 i dont want to be a poster boy for sexual abuse
456155 even me who has come through therapy and is not ashamed of it i debate whether i really want to be known for that
456156 but i think that if im debating it only reinforces that i have to be part of it its a way to make people realize theyre not alone its not their fault
456157 i do remember when it first happened it was a family friend
456158 before i knew it he did something to me that i never knew about
456159 the absolute shame and sickness i felt it was just confusing i couldnt make sense of it whats going on did i cause this
456160 i dont know if it happened three times more 10 times more 15 times more
456161 he feared that every time id go away id never come back
456162 i felt it explained so much to me why he wanted people to like him to accept him
456163 i really loved him i felt like i had been stabbed how could he suffer for so long and not feel he could tell me about it he thought i would reject him over something like that
456164 i needed him to understand how deeply he hurt me and for him to take full responsibility for it every day
456165 what really changed everything in our family was us getting the counseling we needed

456194 can begin to break the current legislative stalemate on the senate floor
456195 would bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term

456202 its a shame i didnt manage to get the best out of the car in q3 mainly because of traffic especially on my second run in the first two parts of qualifying the car felt good as can be seen from my times but then i never managed to prepare the tyres in the best way clearly overtaking isnt easy but we have a good pace and i will try and exploit that in fighting with the two drivers ahead of me on the grid
456203 i made a mistake on my final flying lap which cost me time and that followed on from not having got a great lap on my previous attempt which explains why im sixth of course i am not happy and starting from the third row my race will be an uphill struggle i will try and make the most of this situation given that the car today was not that bad we are going through a bit of a difficult time but we mustnt give up all we need to do is put together all the pieces of the jigsaw and then the results will come to us again
456204 obviously we cannot be happy with this result especially when our main opponents have the front row to themselves our main aim this weekend was and still is to get the most out of our car tyre team package and today we failed to do that especially in the final part of qualifying now we have to try and do it in tomorrows race it will be tough because our grid positions are not the best and we are up against very strong opposition but it is not an impossible task we have strong potential which we saw today it will be a case of getting all the elements to come together as well as possible
456205 having our main rivals two cars on the front row is definitely not the most promising start for the race but it in no way means the race is already lost for us tomorrow it will be important to make a good start trying in felipes case to take advantage of starting on the more rubbered in side of the track and to manage tyre performance as well as possible given that we can expect very high temperatures on top of that come the usual parameters strategy reliability team work that have to operate at their best in order to get a good result we have to try our hardest to bring home as many points as possible and only at the end of the race will we see if we have done enough or not
456206 i am really happy with the result this was certainly one of my best qualifying sessions so far this season i was not expecting to start from fourth as the car has been quite difficult to drive over the entire weekend we struggled a bit with the balance but in the end i was able to make the harder tyre compound work very well and here we are i am now looking forward to the race
456207 im totally disappointed it looked quite good at the end of yesterdays practice and also this morning but on my last lap in q1 i had four cars in my way most of them at least tried to give me room but it still cost me time towards the end of the lap i had one car in front which was on an out lap he saw me and accelerated he then overtook sebastien bourdais before the last corner and then sebastien was right in my way i was hoping it was so obvious he would be penalised right away and i could still get into q2
456208 it was a very tight battle at the front with marginal time differences we expected to see mclaren on the front row robert did a very good last lap and secured fourth which means he will be starting in between the two ferraris certainly nicks result is disappointing he complained several times about traffic on his last and important fast lap and missed getting into q2 we should be very happy if he scores a point from this grid position
456209 roberts performance was faultless and he got the most out of the car starting from fourth is an excellent position instead for nick it didnt go as expected he reported traffic on his last lap for him we are facing a very difficult race tomorrow because overtaking is almost impossible at the hungaroring
456210 we knew that the qualifying session would be very close and that proved to be the case the first part was very competitive but we managed to reach q3 with both cars which is positive but i think the race tomorrow will be difficult thats for sure i will try and do my best to be on the pace and hopefully score some points
456211 the session was very competitive and more difficult than i thought it would be in the end i managed to reach q3 and i am happy about that it means we can approach the race sensibly tomorrow and i hope we can make the most of this grid position to score some points
456212 as always the homework done during our free practice sessions has paid off by getting both cars into the final part of qualifying with fuel loads that we believe can help us have a competitive race as everybody knows it is really difficult to pass on this track and so after a good qualifying session pit stops are now of extreme importance
456213 our objective was to reach the top ten and we achieved that but the gap with the leaders is significant and as fernando said at the start of the weekend we had to fight hard to finish in the top ten because that is the situation we are in at the moment with these places on the grid we are now preparing for a closely fought race but we have a sensible strategy each lap will count and we must not make any mistakes
456214 we had a difficult start to this weekend but weve improved throughout the sessions and learnt a lot of things along the way we therefore werent looking too bad for qualifying i made a mistake on my fast lap in q1 and lost two and a half tenths in one corner so my q1 time did not show the true potential of our car we then had a good chance of making it into q3 but a hydraulic problem meant i couldnt go out at all in q2 which was disappointing its pretty interesting here tyre wise as both are very soft on this track but the harder ones were better for me today
456215 it was a difficult qualifying for me aside from plenty of traffic i didnt really manage to find the right balance on my last set of option tyres both factors compromised my run we now need to go through the data and work out whats happening in order to get the most out of the car for tomorrow
456216 it was always going to be a tight qualifying session for us unfortunately kazuki didnt progress through from the first session nico obviously could have delivered more but a hydraulic problem kept him in the garage for the whole of q2 there was no sign of it during the last run in q1 but it became apparent when we fired up for the second session were investigating the cause now and will resolve the problem in time for the race
456217 that was a pretty good qualifying session quite straightforward it would have been nice to have had a bit more pace in q3 but q2 and q1 went well for us im disappointed im on the wrong side of the grid an odd number is always better but we definitely have a chance to get something from where we are so well see how we go tomorrow
456218 i was losing a little bit of time in each of the sectors and i couldnt deliver that last little bit of lap time because i was bringing the mid corner speed too low its tough from thirteenth for sure but the hungarian race can be unpredictable so lets see
456219 a respectable qualifying from mark in a very tight field were close to our nearest rivals in renault and toyota which should make for an interesting race tomorrow david isnt far off the back of that group he unfortunately didnt have a good second run in q2 but well be fighting hard tomorrow
456220 engine wise we have been completely clear all weekend which has allowed us to concentrate on the performance of both the car and the engine we would have preferred to have seen both cars appearing in q3 but we are sure david will be strong tomorrow mark has a good chance for a good race
456221 that was a very good qualifying session for me and im obviously delighted we made a good start in first practice yesterday the team did a good job overnight and we made the right choice over set up it wasnt easy today because we had a very tight choice over tyres so we had to make a close decision for every lap but in the end my engineers stayed cool and got it right in q2 the car felt perfect then on the very last lap it was a bit trickier again because the tyres didnt behave quite as well but im happy with p5 we are in a great situation for tomorrow its good for all of us and after hockenheim this is the perfect answer for the faith i have in the whole team
456222 im glad to be in the top ten but that was a difficult qualifying session and p9 is disappointing since this morning i have struggled for grip and balance and unfortunately we werent able to find the answers in time i had the same problems in qualifying so we will have to investigate that tonight im happy for timo who has done a good job this weekend and it is clearly important for us to score as many points as possible for the constructors championship overtaking is very difficult here but tomorrow is a very long race and we will see what we can achieve
456223 from the pit wall that was a very exciting and pleasing hour of qualifying we were fighting in the top three for all the sessions except for the very last lap we will investigate what happened but compared to the outings before we slightly underperformed still there is no room for disappointment timo took his best ever grid position and he was very strong during all the sessions well have to see what the fuel loads are tomorrow but when all the cars were at low fuel he was consistently in the top three jarno struggled for balance so we will look into the data tonight the tyres were a very close call today but we organised our run plan so that we were able to make the right decisions at the right time and it worked out now we have a strong position for the race tomorrow with both drivers
456224 a shame to miss out on q3 by one hundredth but we expected it to be tight we can be happy though especially given i only managed nine laps yesterday it means we did a good job today now we can do what we like in terms of fuel load for the race and hopefully find a good strategy ive yet to do a long run this weekend but i think we can find a good compromise between qualifying and race pace and we have a good set up on the car
456225 i struggled with the option tyre as it gave me no grip and i was sliding around more and had no feel for the car i was very happy in a well balanced car earlier on but after that im not really sure what happened i am disappointed because even if q3 would have been hard to reach i could not match my q1 time in q2
456226 i think we recovered well today from not having done enough running with vettel yesterday bourdais did a good job but did not get his last qualifying run quite right as unlike his team mate he was unable to take advantage of the extra grip from the options all in all i think we exploited the potential of our package and did a good job for vettel the one unknown tomorrow will be driving on a full tank as he has not had the chance to try it
456227 im happy to have qualified in p12 today after a good lap on the final run in q2 pushed me a few places up the grid weve definitely made some progress with the new developments to the car and in particular the new rear suspension is working well and this has enabled us to improve the car step by step over the weekend i got the most out of the car today and its encouraging to see we were only three tenths away from the top ten as it has been a while since we were that close im on the dirty side of the grid which is a disadvantage but i am sure we can have a good race tomorrow from here nonetheless
456228 choosing which tyre to run was a really tough decision today and it was a difficult qualifying session i felt the super soft option tyre was working slightly better with the car so i stayed with that for my final run after a good first sector i went in too quick for turn 11 and made a mistake which ruined my lap with that went the chance to progress to q2 and the time from my previous run puts me in 18th place on the grid the lap was going quite well but a mistake at turn 11 meant that i had to abort the lap i have to settle for 18th place today and turn my focus now to the race
456229 p12 is where we hoped to be today so we have moved a little closer to the middle order again the new mechanical developments have brought us improved stability and that has enabled us to achieve a better balance on the car this weekend due credit to jenson as he delivered a particularly good lap when it counted and we have reason to feel optimistic about tomorrows race unfortunately both cars will be starting from the dirty side of the grid so holding position into the first corner will be key from there with a free fuel allowance jenson is in a good position to target the top ten with a good strategy and strong pitstops for rubens it is likely to be a difficult race in the absence of safety cars or other incidents so we have to stay sharp and be ready to take advantage of whatever opportunities may present themselves
456230 conditions today were tough but actually that was the maximum we could do the target was to do a 1min 21 7 or 21 8 and we did a 21 6 so that was the most we could get out of the car the balance was not too bad but unfortunately the grip level is still very poor i think were not particularly quick round here and we have to accept that but we are still quite close we are to the others
456231 it was a hot tough qualifying and i am not 100 happy with the session the tyres did not behave as we expected and i had lots of graining which meant we couldnt get a good balance out of the car i decided to run the harder set of tyres in the end for my fastest lap but at least i didnt get the effects of the graining with them overall im not that happy but lets see what happens tomorrow
456232 it would be very easy to say were on the back row again but weve been eliminated from q1 with a bmw a honda and a williams so clearly this is a very competitive field here yet again one second from the top 10 shows were getting closer although we have had to revert back to the standard shift box for the weekend we are very optimistic about running the seamless shift gearbox and look forward to actually racing it in valencia
456233 i think we expected to slip back a bit from our closest rivals due to not running the seamless shift and that proved to be the case giancarlo pretty much got the most out of it he could but unfortunately adrian couldnt get a decent lap together so was a way off his optimum time we know our race pace is better than our qualifying pace and although this makes life difficult at this track we have to get two cars to the end and do a professional job
456234 the team has done a fantastic job of continually improving the car over the past few weeks so im really proud of what weve achieved today its great to have locked out the front row with heikki weve been threatening to do it for a number of races so to achieve it at a track where its tricky to pass is really satisfying theres a great harmony within the team at the moment and we really deserved this i couldnt ask to be in a better position weve both got good strategies for tomorrow and well be challenging for the win
456235 it was difficult to choose the right tyre for the final session and i felt i could have done a slightly faster lap in q3 but i was a little cautious in turn two still weve found a great direction with the car and ive got a great opportunity to win the race tomorrow its fantastic to be starting on the front row alongside lewis i hope that starting on the dirty side of the track wont be a disadvantage and i fully expect us to look out for each other in the first corner tomorrow this result really repays the team for all its efforts over the past few months
456236 todays all vodafone mclaren mercedes front row is a fitting tribute to the phenomenal amount of hard work carried out by the whole team in the lead up to the 2008 hungarian grand prix we brought to budapest the developments that were originally destined to be incorporated into our valencia spec car and the signs are that it has been an effective move a qualifying one two is a rare and pleasing achievement so i want to say a big thank you to all the people who worked so hard to make it possible and that includes everyone in woking mclaren in brixworth mercedes benz highperformanceengines and of course in stuttgart mercedes benz now we hope to convert our excellent qualifying performance into an equally solid race result
456237 a great performance by lewis heikki and our team a dream and our third pole in a row one from heikki two from lewis i hope we will be able to turn our grid positions into a similar result in the race tomorrow

456240 in fact profumi dambiente are so believable that when perceived in the air one is actually convinced that the fragrances are coming directly from objects in the home or garden be it an antique desk an orange grove a pepper mill or from a newborn babys nursery
456241 when i phone mary martin to ask whether i can visit her in wiltshire to talk about her pug obsession she is concerned that i wont be able to find her cottage in the long string of houses that makes up the hidden hamlet of chittoe but theres no doubt which is her home when i see her parked car registration m19 pug and the large plaque of a pug above her front door and the pug statuettes in her garden and for that matter the three fawn coloured bundles that race out yelping to meet me like tiny lions being unleashed into an amphitheatre of christians
456242 we did nine in one day kevin smith diablo matt stone quentin all in one day one of the weirdest things is that there is an episode in the second series that has a pulp fiction scene done shot for shot and to have quentin on the commentary for that scene was quite a trip
456243 how much was a conscious decision to do a show about those sorts of geek things
456244 had a feeling there were others out there like us i just like the idea of speaking on a very personal level through writing and i really enjoy connecting with things and feeling spoken to and i wanted to replicate that
456245 the authenticity of the world is something that we wanted to make that was the major thing that made it unique and truthful for the audience youre writing about your own experiences your own life your own world
456246 i think the thing that kind of resonates with fans is that they can sympathize with tim and daisy i know someone like that or i am that person at the time that we made it we were those people we were all living those lives and so much came from personal experience and was shot where we all lived
456247 it would have been market researched before they ever shot an episode and they would have worked very hard to sort of homogenize it out
456248 we had no kind of scrutiny or interference whatsoever i think because of the low budget of the show we never had any conversations about the content of the show the only thing we were ever told is that we were only allowed to say the f word twice we look back on it now and know how lucky we are youd never be able to make that kind of show here in america
456249 in america you have to add some sort of morale message or some sort of punitive outcome we wanted to just show a slice of life and show how it was without any comment on it either way tim would spark up a joint and it just wouldnt be mentioned and it was just something tim would do every day
456250 sort of a junction point for a lot of people to meet and then go off in many different directions
456251 we did used to say that it had a lot of actors from other shows it was like a marvel dc crossover title we had the best of the current generation of actors doing guest spots
456252 we dont know we definitely had a story arc for a third season if you see the end of the dvd there is a little tim and daisy special im so old now you know tim was like 27
456253 we were thinking of doing a new series entirely with cgi flat dialogue and unfunny comedy sketches
456254 i dont know were kinda happy doing films at the moment film is more eternal tv is very ephemeral back when we did spaced it would be on and it would be gone and we decided to work in a medium things would be around forever but who knows never say never so who knows
456255 i think thats a hell of a thing to take on davids doing a hell of a job hes the best doctor since baker it would be nice to sort of dip in play a bad guy and dip out again
456256 its being written and it is happening and thats all ill say
456257 un der tak er clap clap clap clap clap un der tak er clap clap clap clap clap un der tak er clap clap clap clap clap
456258 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
456259 thats such a shame especially for the ones who were clean and its most important for the athletes who were second
456260 you lose that opportunity to stand on top of the podium and feel the joy of winning the race those are the people who hurt the worst when there are cheaters ahead of them giving back the medals is just a technicality because you cant repair the hurt feelings and the hard work that went into it
456261 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
456262 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
456263 only the very best players have got a 100 hundreds ramprakashs century at headingley means the 38 year old joins a very exclusive list of 25 of the greatest names to grace the game jack hobbs walter hammond geoff boycott len hutton graham gooch don bradman vivian richards and zaheer abbas are among the legendary figures to reach the landmark at the end of this summer all the surviving 100 hundred makers will gather for a special celebration at lords but these days its not so much an exclusive club as an endangered species the line which began with wg grace could well come to an abrupt end with mr ramprakash he will probably be the last person to achieve the feat the way the domestic game is going now
456264 so what ramps has achieved is top class and it says a lot about him as a player and him as a person in essence if you play for a county you are going to be playing more and more limited overs cricket and if you play for england then your career will be strictly controlled by the england and wales cricket board ramprakash is special because he has been an incredible scorer for his county but has not been picked for his country since 2002 special but not quite unique ramprakash shared his test match debut against the west indies at headingley in june 1991 with graeme hick the only other active cricketer in the 100 hundreds club there are two sides to it
456265 you can certainly get a lot of pride out of it i know there are a lot of times when ive played some great knocks which have helped the way games have turned out
456266 but to play enough cricket to make 100 hundreds means youre not playing international cricket its a bit of a double edged sword
456267 on reflection if i had played a lot more international cricket it would have been a lot harder a typically honest assessment from the 42 year old who still looks in incredible shape a full decade after he made 100th century langer is the 100 hundred clubs next great hope these days as soon as a talented young batsman emerges he will be centrally contracted and restricted from the century making opportunities which hick has enjoyed for worcestershire if there is a glimmer of hope for the future of the 100 hundred club it glows stubbornly from australia via taunton somersets victory against ramprakashs surrey earlier in the season included justin langers 83rd first class century with his international career over the landmark is in sight if not in reach hes a dogged little player and rather enjoys county cricket so hes the most likely
456268 our judgement is that this merciless attack was the work of the bloody separatist group
456269 i would warmly welcome it if he would stay in the parliament return to the frontbench and re engage with politics
456270 if he was planning to come back all along keeping well out of the howard legacy immediately after the election so he can make a clean start after october might end up being a clever strategy
456271 no matter what women achieve some people apparently still see them as sex objects
456272 the public response to sam newmans latest outburst shows that most people appreciate how stupid and shallow his comments are
456273 sam operates outside the boundary of good taste like most people i find the comments highly inappropriate
456274 paulas a fantastic person and she just doesnt deserve it
456275 he just wants to attract attention it cant be anything else and i dont think he is going to change
456276 it seems as if he is in pursuit of infamy and if thats the case perhaps he should be taken off air people find him offensive and inappropriate
456277 nine management should really pull sam newman in and tell him what is and what isnt appropriate in terms of his role on tv
456278 we are a free country and i guess people want sam on television
456279 its a rough and tumble show but sam went too far
456280 we dont condone feeding of any native animals in kakadu it is an offence under commonwealth environment law
456281 its hugely irresponsible but people slap the geese on the surface of the water and the croc comes over for a feed he said
456282 we saw rough nut about 60m away lying on the surface of the water
456283 he went under and surfaced again and then went under again
456284 i got weed on my lure and banged it on the surface of the water to get the weed off
456285 the croc suddenly leapt out of the water and came right at me
456286 we used to sell dresses for primary school students up to 16 but weve had to go up to size 20
456287 we had a couple go to the emergency department because they were feeling very unwell
456288 they had vomiting burning in the eyes and were unable to breathe properly
456289 this has had an effect health wise on the staff even though we are taking all necessary precautions with workplace health and safety
456290 they have hearts they have brains they breathe they eat they sleep they do everything any other animal or person does
456291 when we see something and we take an animal from someones property where we dont think theyre being properly cared for we have a duty of care to look after them

456297 i thought it might be tactical aidan said she is very straightforward and to bounce her out
456298 there is no point complicating it we were going nice and steady and i knew i was in the right place
456299 she is very brave and very tough shes come on from the guineas shes thickened up well and shes moving well she wins like this a lot she is lazy
456300 a fast mile is ok and a mile and a quarter is no problem so she has plenty of options
456301 shes a classic winner a nassau winner the roll continues
456302 these things happen kevin gave an accurate assessment of what happened and im not in the blame game i leave that to others
456303 im not sure where we will go now she is in the yorkshire oaks and well have a look at that and there is also leopardstown irish champion there will be plenty of good days left
456304 she has run really well she probably would have preferred a better pace and the weight for age has probably made the difference
456305 when you become overconfident you lose the excitement and thats what its all about

456308 you can be a nobel laureate and not qualify to teach in most public schools today because they dont have all the proper credits in educational theory or methodology
456309 we have decided to leave our posts after we have seen the mismanagement of the prime minister he sacked the mayor of mogadishu without consulting the council of ministers
456310 no initiatives were launched in parliament for the last seven months and there was a total misuse of the nations resources while the government also failed to ensure security
456311 the prime minister is the leader of the executive arm of the government and the president is the head of state but there has always been a problem with the somali constitution and who has the most power
456312 obviously we cannot be happy with this result especially when our main opponents have the front row to themselves
456313 our main aim this weekend was and still is to get the most out of our car tyre team package and today we failed to do that especially in the final part of qualifying
456314 its a shame i didnt manage to get the best out of the car in q3 mainly because of traffic especially on my second run in the first two parts of qualifying the car felt good as can be seen from my times but then i never managed to prepare the tyres in the best way clearly overtaking isnt easy but we have a good pace and i will try and exploit that in fighting with the two drivers ahead of me on the grid
456315 i made a mistake on my final flying lap which cost me precious time and that followed on from not having got a great lap on my previous attempt which explains why im sixth of course i am not happy and starting from the third row my race will be an uphill struggle i will try and make the most of this situation given that the car today was not that bad we are going through a bit of a difficult time but we mustnt give up all we need to do is put together all the pieces of the jigsaw and then the results will come to us again
456316 having our main rivals two cars on the front row is definitely not the most promising start for the race but it in no way means the race is already lost for us tomorrow it will be important to make a good start trying in felipes case to take advantage of starting on the more rubbered in side of the track and to manage tyre performance as well as possible given that we can expect very high temperatures on top of that come the usual parameters strategy reliability team work that have to operate at their best in order to get a good result we have to try our hardest to bring home as many points as possible and only at the end of the race will we see if we have done enough or not
456317 whenever america targets and kills innocent people it comes up with such propaganda that it has killed a big personality in an attempt to justify the cruelty it has done

456487 i believe that the bush administration will spend more time on terrorism generally and on al qaeda specifically than any other subject
456488 the plan to confront al quaeda was estimated to cost several hundreds of millions of dollars
456489 we wanted to know what single economic threat he mccain perceives above all others
456490 well i would think that the absolute gravest threat is the struggle that were in against radical islamic extremism which can affect if they prevail our very existence another successful attack on the united states of america could have devastating consequences

456510 ivins was hounded by aggressive fbi agents who raided his home twice said dr w russell byrne a colleague who worked in the bacteriology division of the fort detrick research facility for 15 years byrne said ivins was forcefully removed from his job by local police recently because of fears that he had become a danger to himself or others the investigation led to ivins being hospitalized for depression earlier this month byrne said
456511 a quiet man he was always very helpful and pleasant
456512 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation
456513 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
456514 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
456515 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
456516 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
456517 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
456518 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
456519 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
456520 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
456521 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
456522 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
456523 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
456524 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
456525 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
456526 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
456527 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
456528 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

456913 i cant say enough how sorry we are and its our responsibility being nascar that we dont go through this situation again the race didnt come off like we had hoped the fans didnt get what they exactly wanted and well do everything in our power it wont happen again i can tell you that much
456914 i dont think anybody was happy with it the drivers the fans the teams nascar i dont think anybody was happy with the result obviously
456915 i didnt think it was anything we could really control there we were probably running only 70 percent when we blew that tire along with everybody else i dont think we could have really done anything different about that there were actually two other guys that blew them at the same time i did its just that mine was more severe and the other guys were just getting flat
456916 in retrospect obviously the tire was obviously not good enough
456917 theres no other way to say it ive heard some people different groups blaming different people my view of it is that ultimately nascar has dedicated goodyear the tire that were going to run so that means nascar has some responsibility but ultimately the responsibility of the tire rests with goodyear

457017 ferrari muss in ungarn sich selbst und der formel 1 beweisen dass hockenheim nur ein ausrutscher war
457018 budapest hat eine andere streckencharakteristik als hockenheim oder silverstone der kurs hnelt mehr monte carlo oder montreal wir wissen dass der hauptvorteil unseres autos besonders auf schnellen strecken und in extrem schnellen kurven zum tragen kommt wir haben zwar entwicklungsfortschritte auf engen winkligen kursen gemacht aber erst in budapest werden wir sehen wie das kr fteverh ltnis in dieser beziehung zu ferrari aussieht
457019 wir wissen im moment nur dass das mclaren chassis im gegensatz zu unserem auto aggressiver mit den reifen umgeht
457020 das bedeutet mclaren kommt schneller auf die optimale reifentemperatur als wir daraus ergeben sich vorteile vor allem in der qualifikation unser plus lag bisher darin dass wir dagegen im rennen also auf die langen distanzen sowie bei hohen au en und asphalttemperaturen vorteile wegen des geringeren reifenverschlei es hatten
457021 unter normalen bedingungen ist budapest ein kurs der den ferraris besser liegt
457022 grunds tzlich hat ferrari von den bisherigen rennen und den bisher zu vergebenen trainingsbestzeiten jeweils die h lfte gewonnen und herausgefahren in der konstrukteurswertung liegen wir auf platz eins und am ende des rennens heute kann jeder von unseren beiden fahrern auch in der fahrerwertung wieder platz eins belegen

457101 election canada returns show the liberals raised 912 000 in april may and june from 9 556 contributors but that paled beside the 3 5 million the conservative party raised from 33 833 individual donors
457102 before the december 2006 convention that chose st phane dion as leader mr
457103 didnt even have a single membership list held by the national party
457104 of course it wasnt always hard for the liberals to raise money in fact back in the days when jean chretien was running the liberal party fundraising was an easy three step process
457105 the bitter legacy of jean chretiens campaign finance reforms which wiped out corporate donations the source of 50 of liberal fund raising
457106 many liberals were unhappy with the ban on corporate donations stephen ledrew then party president famously called it as dumb as a bag of hammers further complicating liberal fundraising is that candidates from the 2006 leadership including mr dion are still paying off debts there are liberals here in montreal who are getting called from two sides says mr seidle an expert on electoral reform and party financing

457121 what were seeing is a mild recession interrupted here by a rebate program
457122 once they consumers finish spending these checks well head down again
457123 a sign of how troubled our economy is that some analysts are greeting the seventh straight month of job losses and an increase in the unemployment rate to 5 7 percent as relatively good news
457124 this stimulus should include increases in the federal share of medicaid significantly increase funding for home energy assistance and food stamps and other measures which will provide badly needed stimulus for our economy and help state and local governments and individuals improve the quality of their lives
457125 the fed is stuck on hold trapped between a weak economy on one side and high headline inflation on the other

457134 only re emphasizes more coordination between ministry of interior and isi in relation to war on terror and internal security
457135 emasculating the isi had relevance only to personal gain having nothing to do with national interest
457136 grandly show the united states that the civilian government had brought the isi to heel
457137 enhance and solidify asif ali zardaris control over the country
457138 justified in trying to bring the premier intelligence agency under civilian control

457405 we did find some areas where although he initially resisted he came around
457406 it was a classic strategy of giving the president things he doesnt want in bills he has to have
457407 in the eighth year of the presidency and in this environment bushs veto was pretty strong
457408 he had to compromise and he had to do it in two ways either they negotiated out a compromise or he was pushed into a compromise politically because of where the votes were
457409 the president doesnt get involved much with what goes on around here
457410 talking about a second stimulus package right now is premature
457411 well fight if we must but wed much rather dance
457412 what i said in front of a 98 per cent conservative rural white audience in missouri is nothing that i havent said before
457413 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
457414 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
457415 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
457416 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
457417 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates

457420 richmond might win the same amount of games next year without greg or go nowhere and stay ninth
457421 its all irrelevant until the club decides it wants to make great planning decisions
457422 i am only an outsider looking in these days and i am no longer privy to what happens there but you have to say that it doesnt make a lot of sense
457423 im a life member im a past player and if the richmond fans feel that i never ever stop to think about how to help richmond that would be wrong
457424 i have not spoken to anybody at richmond or anyone acting for richmond
457425 its not a romantic thing but its whether im sick and tired of doing what im doing and im saying ok now its time to get back and sort this club out
457426 greg has done so much for this club in many different areas during his time there
457427 if he was not the right person to run the footy department then dont tell me he couldnt have played some other role
457428 i was very surprised that they were happy to lose a person of gregs football background and experience
457429 the second point is that i was personally disappointed with the way it was done i thought there was a complete lack of respect for what greg miller had done for our football club
457430 i understand that in football things can sometimes leak out but this was an incredibly important member of the club greg did not deserve what he ended up getting
457431 most of my discussions with them the board members were trying to get to the bottom of what was rumour and what was true

457469 it isnt like we havent been here in two or three years we were just here six weeks ago so everybody kind of knows what to expect as far as the track goes
457470 when it clouds up it gains a lot of grip and a lot of speed when the sun breaks out it gets slick and greasy that has a lot to do with the outcome of the race and hopefully it will be just fine
457471 i think we had a pretty good baseline last time here we were pretty happy with our race car so well go back and look at those notes a lot and take what we learned yesterday with the track being a good bit different for us and try to incorporate that all into a best educated guess on what we want
457472 theres always a menu of stuff that we would like to try to improve our car like everyone else

457497 los proyectos grannacionales materializan y dan vida concreta a los procesos sociales y econ micos de la integraci n y la uni n y abarcan desde lo pol tico social cultural econ mico cient fico e industrial hasta cualquier otro mbito que puede ser incorporado
457498 es con el nacimiento del alba que las fuerzas revolucionarias hemos podido pasar a una nueva situaci n que bien pudi ramos definir como de acumulaci n de la fuerza pol tica necesaria para la consolidaci n del cambio que se ha producido en la correlaci n de fuerzas pol ticas de nuestro continente
457499 la de construcci n de alternativas y de la disputa por una nueva direcci n pol tica
457500 quien no entiende esa nueva fase dej de captar la marcha de la lucha antineoliberal
457501 se impone de nuevo lo que pudi ramos llamar la revancha de la pol tica que la pol tica vuelva a la carga y que tome la vanguardia de los procesos de integraci n
457502 los movimientos sociales son un componente muy importante pero no el nico del campo popular o del campo de la izquierda como se quiera llamar al que pertenecen tambi n las fuerzas pol ticas gobiernos locales estaduales provinciales o nacionales nunca los movimientos sociales aut nomamente dirigir n o han dirigido un proceso de transformaci n en la sociedad para hacerlo tuvieron que como en bolivia construir un partido en este caso el mas movimiento al socialismo esto significa restablecer de una nueva forma las relaciones con la esfera pol tica para poder construir una hegemon a alternativa
457503 lo que si estamos diciendo es que nosotros vamos a ir a votar por el s y llamamos a votar por el s por todas las luchas que hemos realizado decir s a la lucha que hemos desarrollado a lo largo y ancho de estas d cadas

457523 the bush administration is up to its old tricks again quietly putting ideology before science and womens health
457524 our new name has been worked out in consultation with the holy see but as with all things of this nature we can only say that the name will be absolutely finalised when the communitys statutes are approved this is normal proceedure
457525 among the noteworthy changes that catholics will notice when the new translation goes into effect are
457526 lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world
457527 through my fault through my fault through my most grievous fault
457528 the practice of indiscriminately presenting oneself to receive holy communion merely as a consequence of being present at mass is an abuse that must be corrected
457529 until they bring to an end the objective situation of sin
457530 this decision properly speaking is not a sanction or a penalty
457531 nor is the minister of the holy communion passing judgment on the persons subjective guilt but rather is reacting to the persons public unworthiness to receive holy communion due to an objective situation of sin
457532 if a priest or bishop does not punish a public sinner it is the priest or bishop who is wrong
457533 the new catholic archbishop for the twin cities has told a parish that it can no longer hold prayer services celebrating the homosexual lifestyle and that parishioners ought to pray for peace instead if they want to remain in conformity with catholic teaching the archdiocese of st paul and minneapolis led by its new administrator archbishop john nienstedt informed parish staff members of st joan of arc church that their annual homosexual pride prayer service planned for wednesday an event that has been held for several years in conjunction with the annual twin cities pride celebration must come to a permanent end

457537 jesus has sustained me and allowed me to forgive others and myself
457538 if i could recover and i did you can too so go heal and get over yourself
457539 demands i have read about by victim support groups are arrogant
457540 what i wish is that all clergy would recognize the degree of damage done and have a mindset of compassion and a program of actual healing
457541 the truth of the real presence of christ in the eucharist helps the devotion of the faithful and introduces the sense of mystery more easily
457542 today at noon in rome 5 a m cdt it was announced that his holiness pope benedict xvi has named me prefect of the supreme tribunal of the apostolic signatura effective immediately with the announcement i ceased to be the archbishop of st louis
457543 fr andrew greeley is one of my heros in the church today
457544 let the little children come to me unless i dont like their friends
457545 what may be known about god is plain to them sinners
457546 in the hope that god will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth
457547 so what to do i have an idea can anyone out there score me some consecrated communion wafers ill show you sacrilege gladly and with much fanfare but will instead treat it with profound disrespect and heinous cracker abuse all photographed and presented here on the web i shall do so joyfully and with laughter in my heart
457548 the point of the article was that somebody desecrated a host by taking it and eventually returning it to a priest and received death threats for his actions outrage is entirely appropriate but the plain facts are that we should not be threatening things like that
457549 oh arent you so called christians such hypocrites you talk about love and forgiveness and wwjd and here your kind are threatening me what are you going to do about it
457550 i give praise to you father lord of heaven and earth for although you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned you have revealed them to the childlike
457551 all in all it shows just what catholics are made of
457552 but i see a great deal of hatred and bigotry from the jews blacks atheists muslims here
457553 down with authority down with traditions down with my culture down with everyone else and everything they hold sacred but up with me i am god
457554 did jesus speak to the masses in a foreign tongue
457555 i personally find its length difficult when ive got my kid in the pew
457556 ps you dont really object to receiving both species of the sacrament at mass do you and extraordinary ministers that is clearly a revival of how communion was received in earlier times in the church
457557 it is beautiful but could appear sexist to those who didnt know better
457558 beach masses teddy bear masses clown masses magic masses bingo masses halloween masses puppet masses gymnastic masses animal masses

457561 we have induced some of our children to join the christian body with the explicit intimation that they should work for the disintegration of the christian church by creating scandals within her
457562 we are the fathers of all revolutions we were the creators of the protestant reformation martin luther was our dupe
457563 yesterday i was at church so i have no reason to feel guilty
457564 because her action was of a public nature i do not believe in this case confession and penance suffice

457575 laughable ridiculous preposterous and revealing all at the same time
457576 no word on whether they played a remix of hail to the chief as obama walked in
457577 has decided not to wait for any of the formalities like a presidential election an inauguration or even a nomination which he still hasnt actually officially won yet
457578 im told that obama recognizes that it was a silly mistake
457579 daddy bush was a nice guy but out of touch
457580 i think the intention of the holy father is to allow the practice of the extraordinary rite where there is a need and a request
457581 in our diocese we have one parish at the moment there is no need for other places i think this is responding to the need of the population
457582 the holy father is not returning to the past he is taking a treasure from the past to offer it alongside the rich celebration of the new rite
457583 all the parishes not many all the parishes because this is a gift of god he pope benedict offers these riches and it is very important for new generations to know the past of the church
457584 appreciate the power of the silence the power of the sacred way in front of god the deep theology to discover how and why the priest represents the person of christ and to pray with the priest
457585 a group of faithful attached to the previous liturgical tradition exists stably

457697 circumcision with this technique promises to be faster safer and more acceptable to patients than conventional surgical circumcision methods

457699 the beauty of this device is its simple innovative design

457702 82 of people in western countries have at least one sibling and siblings generally spend more time together during childhood than they do with parents
457703 the story of cain and abel tells of one brothers jealousy after god appeared to favour his sibling and the jealousy ultimately leads to murder jacob tricks his brother esau out of his inheritance sisters leah and rachel compete for the love of jacob while josephs brothers are so jealous that they sell him into slavery
457704 a number of shakepeares plays displays incidences of sibling rivalry
457705 in sense and sensibility jane austen the sisters elinor and marianne dashwood are in conflict with each other due to their different views on life and proper conduct in east of eden john steinbeck the brothers cal and aron trask are counterparts to cain and abel of the bible story
457706 sibling rivalry is a common theme in media that features child characters reflecting the importance of this issue in early life
457707 adult siblings can also be portrayed with a rivalrous relationship often a continuation of childhood conflicts situation comedies exploit this to comic effect for example ross and monica geller in friends raymond and robert barone in everybody loves raymond sibling relationships may be shown as alternately loving and argumentative rose and maggie in in her shoes brothers or sisters in a similar line of work may display professional rivalry frasier and niles crane in frasier in serious drama conflict between siblings can be fatal michael and fredo corleone in the godfather
457708 occasionally real life instances of sibling rivalry are publicized in the mass media
457709 actresses olivia de havilland and joan fontaine had an uneasy relationship from childhood and in 1975 the sisters stopped speaking to each other completely the rivalry between singers lata mangeshkar and asha bhosle is often talked about in the indian media in spite of their insistence that these are just tales twin sisters and advice columnists ann landers and abigail van buren had a relationship that was alternately very close and publicly antagonistic journalists christopher and peter hitchens have had many public disagreements and at least one protracted falling out due to their differing political and religious views
457710 according to kyla boyse from the university of michigan each child in a family competes to define who they are as individuals and want to show that they are separate from their siblings
457711 sibling rivalry usually starts right after or before the arrival of the second child
457712 according to observational studies by judy dunn children are sensitive from the age of one year to differences in parental treatment
457713 sibling rivalry often continues throughout childhood and can be very frustrating and stressful to parents
457714 sibling rivalry can continue into adulthood and sibling relationships can change dramatically over the years events such as a parents illness may bring siblings closer together whereas marriage may drive them apart particularly if the in law relationship is strained approximately one third of adults describe their relationship with siblings as rivalrous or distant however rivalry often lessens over time and at least 80 percent of siblings over age 60 enjoy close ties

457726 matilda means the world to michelle who is now left alone to raise her daughter and spike who has no children of his own has been very good to both michelle and matilda
457727 spike had a gentle way of just being there for michelle there was no pressure for her to spend time with him he just wanted to be a loving supportive shoulder for michelle to cry on and his patience and kindness caused michelle to look at him in a different light now the two are spending more time together and their one time friendship has developed into more
457728 michelle loves spikes quirky sense of humor and his brilliant talent and he adores her soft feminine demeanor and he is in awe of the way she parents her daughter this could certainly prove to be the right match for them both

457743 it also will weaken iran which has been using hamas and hezbollah as a way to stir up mischief in the region if weve gotten an israeli palestinian peace deal maybe at the same time peeling syria out of the iranian orbit that makes it easier to isolate iran so that they have a tougher time developing a nuclear weapon

457859 prior to our investigation of the guillemot population of skomer island the impact of oil pollution on seabird mortality rates at a particular colony was difficult to quantify as oil spills usually occur in wintering areas where birds from many different colonies may be distributed over a wide area
457860 our research has also shown that the nao index has had a significant effect on the guillemot population the consistently high values of this climatic phenomenon for the past 30 years may be due to human induced global climate change if this is the case it would mean that seabirds are vulnerable to human activities on two counts oil pollution from tanker spills and changes to the ecosystem as measured by the nao index and caused by global climate change from mans burning of fossil fuels

457882 however effective the uk s emergency provisions turn out to be when they are seriously tested it will be like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted it is essential that next year s energy white paper addresses the issues currently facing the gas industry otherwise the uk will find itself facing even more difficult problems in a world already struggling with an oil price shock

457920 the study showed that libraries museums and archives are part of only a relatively small number of true information organisations and they are valued as such by the general public
457921 although these organisations are thought to be important the study also highlights the improvements they need to make in order to remain relevant in todays information age
457922 many respondents were unaware of the full range of resources available and the data also indicate the perpetuation of some outdated attitudes
457923 in summary the study found that despite the myriad of information available to people the traditional services of museums archives and libraries are felt to be significant both culturally and as a source of information and understanding however they need to ensure that their services develop and extend to ensure that they keep their place in the nations hearts and minds

457926 we found that whilst the west antarctic ice sheet was thickening in places and thinning in others the east antarctic ice sheet showed significant thickening in many areas specifically towards the centre of the ice sheet
457927 this thickening correlated very well with the snowfall modelling showing that the increased snowfall is causing the ice sheet to grow in mass we estimate that the ice sheet is holding an extra 45 billion tonnes of water each year the equivalent of a sea level drop of 0 12mm a year
457928 at the same time the thinning of the greenland ice sheet is contributing to a sea level rise of 0 2mm a year this is being offset to some extent by the sea level drop caused by the thickening of the east antarctic ice sheet
457929 global warming may mean a moister atmosphere and therefore a wetter climate that increases snowfall on the east antarctic ice sheet however natural climate variations cannot be ruled out without having more years of data
457930 although the thickening of the east antarctic ice sheet is lessening the effects of the sea level rise caused by other melting ice sheets its important to remember that this effect doesnt completely balance out rising sea levels which will still have a significant impact on the planet
457931 the role of the science advisory panel is to oversee the process of finding the right people to present the jury with a balanced view of nanotechnology

457951 professor watson will bring a wealth of experience in nursing research and development to the university and will be working alongside our existing research professors and other research active staff in the school of nursing and midwifery to further develop our excellent work in this area i m looking forward to welcoming him to sheffield
457952 once the resource is created the next step for the project will be to carry out record linkage we will be looking to produce approximately one hundred biographies of people that appear in a number of sources then patterns will be looked for which will determine the relationship between different types of life experience for example we will calculate the proportions of those who received poor relief or were treated at st thomas s hospital who were also involved as victims or defendants in prosecutions for theft in order to determine the relationships between crime poverty and illness
457953 this research will not only provide a fantastic insight into the lives of ordinary londoners but it will also improve our understanding of how their experiences and demands contributed to the development of modern social welfare and judicial practices
457954 this research raises some questions over the uk government s approach to scrapie eradication while existing methods are likely to increase scrapie resistance in national flocks in the short term we do not know what the long term impacts on scrapie resistance or on other traits will be further investigations into these questions should be a research priority
457955 weathering and soil erosion is a serious environmental issue that we need to better understand working collectively will allow the consortium to move out of traditional science areas to create a new integrated international and interdisciplinary approach to tackling this critical issue
457956 we have proven capacity to conduct world class research in many relevant areas but with this award we have established a unique interdisciplinary group that will allow us to build on this expertise but also conduct critical new research
457957 this award is national recognition of the hard work and successful collaboration of the six yorkshire universities the impact programme has proved a huge success and this award further underlines why this type of provision is so essential in today s diverse higher education environment
457958 our research has shown that older people from chinese communities are at a disadvantage when trying to access information about cancer and treatments for cancer due to language and other cultural barriers
457959 to combat this disadvantage health care providers need to ensure that information about cancer is made readily available in written and audio formats in the appropriate languages for the chinese community more needs to be done to cater for the specific needs of older chinese people who have cancer and to ensure that they have all the information to hand to make informed decisions about treatment and care
457960 i m delighted to award professor xie the honorary degree of doctor of science in recognition of his achievements in developing shanghai jiao tong university into a modern world class institution with an international reputation for research excellence in science and engineering
457961 dr william mong is an eminently worthy recipient of the degree of doctor of engineering i am honoured to be presenting the degree to dr mong in recognition of the immense impact he has had both as a businessman and a philanthropist on the lives of people in south east asia and beyond
457962 this medal is a great honour and i am deeply flattered the british ecological society is the worlds oldest ecological society and works with ecologists across the globe i feel very privileged to have my work recognised in this way by its president professor alastair fitter to whom i am very much indebted
457963 thanks to pioneers like doncaster s dr storrs we now know that good hygiene is vital and doctors and nurses in particular are encouraged to thoroughly wash their hands to prevent the spread of infection
457964 the results of the dig are exciting for two reasons
457965 we are extremely grateful to sheer challenge ltd for funding this work in advance of their office and residential development on the west bar site
457966 the child trust fund is important and unusual because it is the first new universal benefit for 50 years and the first capital grant scheme open to all anywhere in the world the fund is also different because unlike many government policies it is long term with the money tied up for 18 years it is clearly aimed at changing attitudes and behaviour
457967 the team that we have entered into the tournament is quite unusual because some of us still play together on a regular basis at goodwin
457968 a great thing about living and working in sheffield is the standard of sporting facilities that the university provide which has meant the old engineering materials team has been able to keep playing football over the years the fact that some of us still play football together regularly will hopefully give us quite an advantage over the other teams
457969 we are delighted to welcome back some of our footballing stars some of the players still live and work in sheffield however for most this will be the first time in many years that they have been back to the city where they studied the goodwin sports centre will also be entering a team and we hope that this will prove a good opportunity for people to catch up and also to relive some friendly footballing rivalry
457970 this new system not only monitors and treats critical patients but it can also learn from the experiences of medical staff who can override the machine at any time
457971 this system is not intended to replace the work that doctors do in intensive care units however it will provide them with invaluable assistance by evaluating the complex interactions of different drugs which are needed to treat patients and protect them against the danger of septic shock
457972 at the university of sheffield we are working with patients to develop drugs and drug delivery methods that provide people with serious illnesses with the best possible pain relief thus enabling them to face either life saving treatments or terminal illness with greater resolve and dignity
457973 we are moving away from the traditional use of morphine which can be effective but can cause many toxic effects and are working with industry to deliver synthetic drugs which have been tested in the laboratory to increase their potency but minimise side effects
457974 our local and international research shows that when given the choice patients overwhelmingly prefer the newer approaches we have pioneered
457975 everyone at arcus is delighted to be involved in this project which will give local people the chance to learn more about archaeological digs and the history of their own community
457976 we believe that parts of the long lost hall survive just beneath the surface so we are confident of making some exciting discoveries and we also hope to find evidence of an earlier medieval hall on the same site this project is a perfect opportunity for people of all ages to get digging and find out about archaeology
457977 the university of sheffields ranking represents a move of four places up the table from last year and is indicative of the universitys ongoing achievement of excellence in research and teaching
457978 it is part of our mission to be internationally recognised as a world class research and teaching centre across a wide range of disciplines and im pleased to see that this years ranking recognises the university of sheffields commitment to this goal
457979 these findings mean that forgery of documents and packaging will be virtually impossible the system is simple to use but so secure that not even the inventors could crack it because it relies on random imperfections from manufacture
457980 in an age where there is a great need for protection against fraud and identity theft and an increased reliance on stringent security controls scientists have an important role to play to ensure that cutting edge technology is used in the fight against crime and terrorism
457981 voices allow the brain to determine various factors about a person s appearance including their sex size and age it is much more complex than most people think and is an extremely important tool for determining someone s identity without having to see them
457982 the female voice is actually more complex than the male voice due to differences in the size and shape of the vocal cords and larynx between women and men and also due to women having greater natural melody in their voices
457983 when a man hears a female voice the auditory section of his brain is activated which analyses the different sounds in order to read the voice and determine the auditory face
457984 when men hear a male voice the part of the brain that processes the information is towards the back of the brain and is colloquially known as the mind s eye
457985 this research could also explain why female voices are considered to be clearer then male voices this could be linked to the fact that female voices are interpreted in the auditory part of the brain and are therefore more easily decoded
457986 the most popular event ever offered to schools as part of the childrens festival
457987 the party is an excellent way for university staff and their families to get together and celebrate this special occasion the range of attractions ensures that there really is something for everybody to enjoy and this will be a very special day in university history
457988 the birthday party is a way of thanking our staff for their hard work and commitment over the past hundred years and to toast to the success of the next hundred
457989 when this new material is online it will be possible to search almost a billion words of british history by keyword crime type and location the expansion of this unique resource will give us an invaluable insight into the lives crimes and punishments of londoners from the 1600s right up into the 20th century
457990 the idea was to show how creative our british engineers can be with recycled material an idea that appeals to the chinese
457991 apparently the chinese found us boring traditional low tech and uncreative before our visit i feel that this initiative has gone a long way to counteract these feelings it has been a great step forward in east and west relations and will hopefully continue to have a lasting impact
457992 competitions like this are a great way to keep the young interested and enthusiastic about engineering and to keep the public informed about the kind of ingenious back street engineering that can be done with motivation enthusiasm and a lot of recycled bits i am really looking forward to seeing some of the old rivals compete again to settle their grudges
457993 this unique event will give magic fans of all ages the chance to experience first hand the stage and film illusions that thrilled and baffled victorian and edwardian audiences
457994 the key to early magic shows was using simple tricks with mirrors smoke and lights to make seemingly impossible things happen the showmanship and performance that illusionists and magicians gave their acts in the old days was what made them so appealing and were hoping to recreate some of that old magic in sheffield next week
457995 the uk call centre industry is now faced with a number of challenges including customer demand for more personal and integrated services in addition there is an increased outsourcing of jobs overseas and an increased use of technology to deal with routine customer interactions
457996 low levels of both task or interaction discretion do not seem to be linked with operational performance measured for example by response time
457997 the ability of call centres to recruit develop and retain skilled customer service representatives is key to meeting these challenges therefore human resource management will be especially crucial in the foreseeable future
457998 im delighted to welcome colleagues from across england to this special event to commemorate the life and works of one of sheffields earliest pioneering dentists
457999 the university of sheffield has a proud tradition of teaching excellence in dentistry and its important for us to commemorate and remember the outstanding work done by our predecessors in the city
458000 pigs in the neolithic tended to be born in spring which would mean if killed as part of a feast or ceremony at eight to ten months old they would have died in december or january at around the time of the winter solstice
458001 our findings at durrington walls certainly seem to suggest that neolithic people were taking part in ceremonies or festivals in the middle of winter our research suggests that stonehenge is just one element of a large complex of monuments in the area including durrington walls therefore we think it is likely that the type of mid winter ceremonies taking place at this site would also have happened at stonehenge
458002 our ongoing excavations at sites near to stonehenge suggest that the famous stone circle is part of a large interconnected group of similar sites linked by their proximity to the river avon we hope that through continued analysis of these various sites we will come to a new understanding of our ancestors use of the stone and wood circles and gain invaluable insights into prehistoric britain
458003 over the past fifty years both our environment and the way we live have changed considerably
458004 one of the problems we have in the uk s that there are far too few specialists to deal with this increasing problem and a lack of education means that parents often dont know about simple changes that could prevent their children from getting eczema or lessen their symptoms
458005 some of the simplest changes are to ensure that any skin products you use are non perfumed and designed for sensitive skin another is to ensure that bedding is washed weekly at 60 degrees to ensure that dust mites are killed
458006 i hope that this programme increases awareness of eczema and its causes only with better education can we improve the control of atopic eczema
458007 the buzz out here is amazing and the bid team seem really confident about winning it s not very often that you get so many celebrities in one place at one time i was speaking to david beckham and was interrupted by the british high commissioner to speak to the prime minister how often does that happen
458008 the whole team was delighted to reach the national finals of the competition our application design would help indecisive clubbers choose the best night out by simply checking out the music planned for that night in their town or citys clubs on their mobile phones were all really excited about this application and were looking for ways to take it forward into development
458009 team genesys innovations have designed an effective tool to help clubbers make the all important choice between one venue and another on a saturday night were delighted that our students have made such progress in the competition and are particularly proud of nicola for becoming the first female student to reach the national finals of microsofts imagine cup success in the imagine cup reflects the fact that our degree courses emphasise teamwork and innovation
458010 im delighted to be back in sheffield and to have the chance to play a part in the universitys centenary celebrations
458011 joannes lecture promises to be an entertaining glimpse into the life of one of our extremely successful former students a must see for any fans of joannes work
458012 im delighted to welcome representatives from both north and south korea to the conference here in sheffield this event will bring together not only academics from both sides of the korean border but from across the world to discuss the vibrant culture and fascinating history of these two countries
458013 this assessment reduces the time a nurse or social worker needs to assess a patient and provides standardised information that can be used across all care services this saves time for the patient and time and resources for the assessor
458014 it is a fantastic example of how research and development in health and social care can directly impact on patients lives
458015 im delighted to welcome my brazilian colleagues to sheffield my teams visit to brazil earlier this year highlighted to us the very particular challenges of working to identify bodies in ribeir o preto
458016 i hope that the ongoing exchange of expertise and knowledge between sheffield and brazil will enable our colleagues to identify homicide victims and lead to the successful prosecution of the perpetrators of these crimes
458017 we are delighted to have received the award as it demonstrates the ongoing commitment of our students to such a worthy cause both the charity and the university are grateful for the partnership disport receives much needed help in the fundraising and organisation of the event while the students gain valuable experience in event management team work and in particular experience of working in the growing area of special needs sport
458018 it is a great opportunity for us to be involved with disport and to be able to provide much needed support for such a valuable event and the many children involved in the project
458019 this unique conference will give people the chance to hear renowned academics and historians speak about the combination of magic vaudeville performance and early film shows that make early popular culture so fascinating
458020 i hope that by giving people the opportunity to see first hand the stage and film illusions that thrilled and baffled victorian and edwardian audiences we can create a real understanding of the skills and tricks involved in bringing such performances to life
458021 im delighted to welcome speakers and delegates from across the world to sheffield for the 18th symposium on polymer analysis and characterisation the two day event will see world leading scientists presenting the latest advances in analysing and understanding complex polymer molecules essential materials in our modern world
458022 this is an exciting project that will give the pupils chance to work alongside world class engineers it is a great opportunity for the students to learn more about engineering while having fun and at the same time to come into a university environment and find out what its really like
458023 i hope this experience will inspire more school children to consider higher education and pursue a career in engineering
458024 richard s death is a tragic loss both to his loved ones and to society as a whole we have been overwhelmed by the number of people whose lives he touched and we are honoured to have had such a special man as part of the university community he will be sadly missed and the memorial ceremony is a way of celebrating his life and bringing together all those who loved him
458025 we are thrilled to welcome the duke of york to the university of sheffield i am sure he will be interested to know more about the way the city the universities and local businesses are working together to develop a world class and economically significant sports industry cluster
458026 this project has been a fantastic opportunity for the pupils they have gained valuable experience in both science and higher education to be invited to the royal society s exhibition is great recognition of all the work that they have put in we have thoroughly enjoyed working with the university and hope to continue our partnership in the future
458027 the time spent at the university of sheffield provided the pupils with an opportunity to experience the sort of hands on practical work that is not possible in school laboratories i would like to congratulate all the pupils who took part they should be very proud that their achievement has been recognized by the royal society
458028 we are delighted to have supported a project that brings school pupils and scientists together and gives the researchers the opportunity to enthuse the students about science and their futures i hope the pupils enjoy their experience at the royal society and the opportunity to meet a wide variety of scientists
458029 science is critically important to our society and the future success of the country its successful future application will depend on the young scientists of today astrazeneca is proud to be associated with this scheme that provides students with scientific challenges and achievements that will hopefully encourage them towards a career in science display of their work at the royal society is an opportunity that they will never forget and they should be highly commended for the hard work that has allowed this to be realised
458030 the ibis ii study is extremely important for women with an increased risk of developing breast cancer
458031 it is vitally important that women come forward to participate in the trial it could provide them with a valuable option in helping to control breast cancer many of us already take medications to prevent heart disease so just imagine the possibilities if in the future we could use a simple once a day medication to reduce the occurrence of breast cancer for those women faced with the reality of being at high risk of developing breast cancer this trial has the potential to change their lives
458032 with over 30 000 post menopausal women being diagnosed with breast cancer in the uk every year it s vital that we look for effective ways of preventing the disease
458033 this trial could potentially save thousands of lives and provide new options for women who know that they are at high risk of developing breast cancer
458034 i urge all women who are concerned about this condition to speak to their doctor
458035 until we are absolutely sure that these amusement devices are illegal gaming devices under guam law i have advised my client to refrain from revoking the licenses because the ramifications of denying the applicati
458036 its in our criminal justice system that everyone is innocent until theyre proven guilty but in all reality until you actually are proven your innocence you carry the scarlet letter of the accused
458037 we were promised by this legislature through our chair that we would see the immediate confirmation hearing for this purpose instead all we have seen are the continuous delays and indecisiveness by our present legislative body
458038 i join the people of guam in mourning the deaths of sgt brian leon guerrero and spc samson mora who were fatally injured in afghanistan
458039 there is a personnel action that has been taken but because its a personnel action i cannot really comment any further until that personnel action is completed
458040 non occorre che vadano date loro voi stessi da mangiare
458041 pronunci la benedizione spezz i pani e li diede ai discepoli
458042 sono giorni nei quali ci si pu dedicare pi a lungo alla preghiera alla lettura e alla meditazione sui significati profondi della vita nel contesto sereno della propria famiglia e dei propri cari
458043 i am honoured to receive this award it is very gratifying that the fruits of many years efforts both by myself and my colleagues at the imperial cancer research fund and more recently here at the university of sheffield should be recognised in this way the fact that i was nominated for this award by my peers makes it all the more special
458044 we are delighted that the planning board has supported the student residences strategy and our plans for the redevelopment of the ranmoor and endcliffe sites this redevelopment will mean that the university can continue to attract top students by delivering the range and quality of accommodation they need which will also be of benefit to the wider city we would like to thank all those who supported our proposals and the local community for working with us in the development of the plans
458045 im delighted to welcome the musicians and dancers from the republic of korea to sheffield
458046 the university of sheffield has a reputation as a centre of excellence for korean studies and we are pleased to work with artists and representatives from the republic of korea to raise awareness and appreciation of korean culture in sheffield and south yorkshire
458047 im delighted that the pisgah ensemble is going to round off the university of sheffields spring concert series with such a varied and exciting programme
458048 the pisgah ensemble gives the universitys most talented string players the opportunity to show off their talents alongside their peers in a unique group which is run by students for students we hope that the concert on 17 may will be most enjoyable for the audience and will show how the pisgah ensemble is going from strength to strength
458049 im delighted to be involved with the einstein life science and art event albert einstein was a fascinating man whose pioneering theories have altered science and mathematics irrevocably this event is a great opportunity to introduce some of einsteins ideas to school pupils from sheffield and to show them that science and art neednt be kept apart i anticipate that both the school pupils and the wider audience in the evening will find the speakers and the artists works to be an enlightening and entertaining fusion of creativity and science
458050 the artworks which will be on display as part of the event are all from my positronic dance series of paintings which aims to make the micro cosmic world of theoretical physics understandable my art is the stuff of science fact and i hope that the young people who attend the event are inspired to see science in a different more artistic light
458051 sheffield like most major cities in the uk has problems with homelessness and inadequate housing in response to these problems we launched the unique give as you rent initiative to support groups working with the homeless in the city
458052 we have been delighted with the generosity of our students each year the initiative goes from strength to strength with the vast majority of students living in university accommodation supporting the scheme the money that we continue to raise will help to improve the quality of life for those individuals who are suffering from poverty and hopefully allow them to get back on their feet
458053 to be chosen to host such a prestigious conference shows that sheffield and the amrc are truly at the cutting edge of metals technology
458054 the research we undertake here has a direct impact on industry and affects technologies and products all over the world
458055 we are delighted that two students from the university of sheffield have received a salters graduate prize this success highlights the dedication and commitment of staff within both departments to encouraging and developing our students
458056 the fact that students in both the departments of chemical and process engineering and chemistry are being recognised by national institutions and industry is a clear sign of the high levels of employability of our students
458057 i am honoured to be representing the university and the department of chemical and process engineering my lecturers have given me an immense amount of support and guidance throughout the degree it is a real boost to have been chosen for the award as i plan to complete a phd in the subject and follow a career in the industry
458058 i feel privileged to have been nominated for this prize and am very much looking forward to attending the presentation ceremony in december following a summer internship at procter and gamble i hope ultimately to pursue a career within the chemical industry the award is a great thing to have on your cv thanks to the prestige of the salters institute for this reason i hope i will be in a good position to start a career in the chemical industry once i have completed my studies
458059 probably indians are slightly in front getting those two wickets of sachin tendulkar and rahul dravid were very crucial for us to keep them back for a while just need to keep them to a decent score that we can chase it down on the fourth or fifth day
458060 ideally if we had got a lead it would have been brilliant but i thought harbhajan bowled very well the previous day to pick up thilan samaraveera and tillakaratne dilshan that put us on the back foot
458061 all credit card transactions will be reported to the irs
458062 payment cards both credit cards and debit cards are an increasingly common form of payment to merchants for property and services rendered some merchants fail to report accurately their gross income including income derived from payment card transactions generally compliance increases significantly for amounts that a third party reports to the irs
458063 could create tensions between acquirers processors and their merchant customers who dont understand how the information is going to be used and or disagree with the methodology by which processors have created the reporting this will result in a tremendous amount of concern and confusion among merchant customers additionally fear of audit could make merchants less likely to accept electronic payments
458064 i t should be expected that the noncompliant taxpayers this proposal targets will ultimately find and develop schemes to avoid recognition through this type of reporting some may simply stop accepting cards altogether thereby making it less likely that the irs will be able to track taxable income others may simply work to find loopholes in the reporting mechanisms that are ultimately established the benefits expected to arise from this initiative may ultimately result in increased costs to the compliant payment card participants consumers acquirers processors issuers merchants with no real benefit to those same participants
458065 our concerns from a privacy angle were that right now most banks that issue credit card merchant accounts have adopted what we consider to be a good and recommendable security practice that is they dont keep individual numbers around if theres a lot of data lying around they dont need it creates a security risk
458066 haben meine bochumer freunde die mich mit innigster herzlichkeit verfolgen gesagt die agenda 2010 sei menschenverachtend
458067 das sind die wahren hintergr nde des verfahrens gegen mich es geht nicht darum dass ich irgendwo einen kommentar geschrieben habe zu dem ich auch jetzt noch jederzeit stehe
458068 ich finde es wichtig dass die parteif hrung offensichtlich verstanden hat das ist keine provinzposse die sich da abspielt
458069 sondern das ist ein politikum und dass sie sich jetzt in das verfahren einschalten will
458070 ich entschuldige mich nicht f r etwas wof r wir nicht verantwortlich sind
458071 wir sind idealisten idealismus ist etwas das mit naivit t verbunden ist
458072 das ist kein trend das ist die folge unserer klaren strategie ich habe vorgegeben dass wir im vorfeld der spiele die maximale anzahl an doping tests durchf hren wollen
458073 wir wollen ihr ein faires verfahren bieten und sie anh ren
458074 i think it is important to pick him from his fingers because most of the variations which he does he does from his fingers and it is important to pick him from his fingers so far it is working well
458075 i hope it continues to be in this series it is difficult because they mendis and muttiah muraltharan have got lot of variations in their armoury you have to react to what they throw at you that is the best way to play against them we just cannot be pre determined against them
458076 if twente make it to the group phase they will get 45 percent and we as champions would have to do with 55 percent
458077 er ist mental nicht hundert prozent bei der sache da habe ich ihm gesagt ich brauche dich gegen real nicht der rummel um ihn ist nicht gut f r uns und auch nicht f r rafael selbst
458078 real hat ein angebot gemacht das der hsv abgelehnt hat das bedeutet dass ich hsv kapit n bleibe solange nichts anderes passiert bis dahin bleibt nur zu sagen dass ich nichts weiteres kommentieren kann
458079 ich habe nie einen besseren spieler gesehen als rafael er ist die beste nummer zehn in europa ich denke sein marktwert liegt bei 30 millionen euro
458080 was jetzt von real geboten wird ist l cherlich ganz ehrlich ich w re sehr entt uscht wenn der verein rafael f r eine summe ziehen lassen w rde die unter jener liegt die wir besprochen und mit ihm verabredet haben
458081 das ganze kommt mir vor wie eine sitcom es ist allen beteiligten zu w nschen dass in dieser sache m glichst bald klarheit herrscht
458082 we are excited to be a part of this world class event and to have an opportunity to showcase our community
458083 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
458084 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
458085 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
458086 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines
458087 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory and he was going to take everybody out there with him
458088 he did not seem to have any particular grudges or idiosyncrasies
458089 he was the last person you would have suspected to be involved in something like this
458090 he always was upbeat with a big smile it was colonel franz let me tell you what im doing i think of him as a geek his pants too short and his pocket protector showing he had a kind of 1960s look
458091 thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this
458092 i was in union missouri which is 98 percent white a rural conservative city and what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
458093 there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this
458094 what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phony allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families
458095 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
458096 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
458097 youll hear from my opponent sen obama tomorrow and if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
458098 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
458099 i think we were perfectly within our rights to protect our candidate and to point out that were not going to lay down for these kinds of tactics
458100 this wasnt injecting race at all thats not the issue here at all and i dont understand why they seem to try to make something out of a thing that took place months ago
458101 he said it out in mississippi before an all white audience and nobody saw it as injecting race and so i think its a shame that a man that ive always considered to be very honorable seems to be running such a dishonorable campaign
458102 obama was anticipating you know that race will be an issue although john mccain has worked very very diligently to make sure that race is not the issue
458103 well let the chips fall where they may when it comes to how people perceive this but we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain whos fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
458104 im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
458105 whats happened is that sen mccain has made a decision that hes going to run 100 percent negative ads and you know why because hes trying to defend policies that are indefensible in our economy foreign policy
458106 this is not the john mccain that we expected in this campaign this is not the john mccain who ran in 2000
458107 barack obama never called john mccain a racist and in fact you know the quote that ricks referring to happened at a town hall meeting in a rural area of missouri not one newspaper reported it the way he accounts for it
458108 and now we see sen mccain saying hes proud of his britney spears paris hilton ad and its really a shame i think the country expected more
458109 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
458110 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
458111 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
458112 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
458113 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
458114 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
458115 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
458116 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
458117 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
458118 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
458119 as popular or unpopular as it is for as tough or as difficult as it is i think the organization has stood strong
458120 theyre decisive and theyre continuing to work through this everyone wants this resolved dont get me wrong no one thought it would get to this point but this is where we are
458121 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
458122 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
458123 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
458124 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
458125 its not going to provide short term relief or medium term relief or in fact long term relief it wont drop prices in this administration or in the next administration or in the administration after that
458126 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
458127 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
458128 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006
458129 this figure is roughly 40 percent higher than cdcs former estimate of 40 000 infections per year which was based on limited data and less precise methods
458130 the data really confirm that there is a severe impact of this epidemic among gay and bisexual men in the united states as well as black men and women
458131 it also mirrors what we see about sexually transmitted diseases and changes in risk behavior among men who have sex with men
458132 the reality is that it is a wake up call for all of us
458133 there are things that you and i can do to stop the disease encourage others to use condoms consistently and correctly abstain from sex
458134 in fact cdcs analysis suggests that the epidemic has been roughly stable since the late 1990s though the number of new hiv infections remains unacceptably high
458135 the analysis shows that new infections peaked in the mid 1980s at approximately 130 000 infections per year and reached a low of about 50 000 in the early 1990s
458136 he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
458137 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications
458138 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story
458139 received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 miles per hour and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident
458140 we are very appreciative again of the patience that everyone has shown us and of the many concerned citizens who have stepped forward to provide information regarding this collision

458143 tell me once more how progressives love free speech online activists thought to be loyal to barack obama are once against using googles software tools to target rival political blogs for elimination as spam blogs this occurred earlier this year when democratic bloggers with a preference for hillary clinton also found themselves locked out of their own blogs all because of spurious and apparently orchestrated claims that these blogs are spam blogs pro obama activists were blamed for those attempts at censorship as well
458144 update this is amusing a lot of rightwing blogs were also affected and shockingly immediately blamed the vast left wing conspiracy and or obama supporters
458145 you will not be able to publish posts to your blog until we review your site and confirm that it is not a spam blog
458146 without any notice apology or explanation my posting privileges has been reinstated
458147 bloggers guilty until proven innocent approach is appalling as bloggers it is a good thing we still have choices and i have exercised my choice to leave blogger and establish a new home at wordpress
458148 the problem with these people who had their google accounts shut down theyre intimidated by it
458149 they dont want to get themselves in a situation so they would be identified some of these people who get identified the obama folks start picking up the phone and calling i had phone calls into my office threatening me saying that youre going to be fired let me talk to your boss i told them to go fuck themselves because i am my own boss it helps to be self employed

458433 i find it very laudable that so many people are getting together and in a very short span of 101 hours are making a film that makes impact they may have had nothing to do with that ngo and with which they have no familiarity prior to being allotted this ngo i think it is very laudable effort and i can only envision a better and a brighter future for this i think more and more of such efforts need to be made
458434 but the eunuchs on whom she made a film some time back told us a very simple thing that despite numerous filmmakers making films on them they were still living in the pathetic conditions what we understood out of their statement was that every film should have a social message to be effective so our responsibility as a filmmaker was not just to make a film and win the competition but to make a good film
458435 today there are three crore bangladeshis in india but the kashmiri hindus are forced to live as refugees in their own country they bangladeshis are allowed to live because they are muslims this is nothing but an apparent case of muslim appeasement
458436 they the activists of bajarang dal have been told that the police is verifying details about them the people of unauthorized habitat near the city and if they will be bangladeshis then we will deport them as we have instruction for to do so but our investigation reveals that many of them are native of assams barpeta region they the activists have done wrong therefore we have arrested them
458437 im extremely lucky i think as early in my career id be working with the yash raj banner they yash raj banner people treat you like a family its been a wonderful experience and im really looking forward to doing more films with them

458455 the government should resolve the problem immediately as the whole jammu is burning today people are dying but the government will also feel the heat of it we want the land back
458456 the government is misleading entire country the sentiments of the people hindus are constantly being hurt we will not tolerate this
458457 we were stopped at the airport in jammu and kashmir and were compelled to go back i think its a breach of our democratic rights administration has responsibility to manage traditional affairs in a proper way resorting to repressive policies will further escalate already worsening condition
458458 i just saw one of the democrats interviewed on television the question was if oil was 10 a gallon and you knew exactly where to get it in alaska or on the coast would you drill there and there was no answer

458466 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
458467 the iraqi government to be more aggressive in dealing with the problem of kirkuk governorate and desist from accommodating the kurdish side which waterhouse situation in the province
458468 appease the government at the expense of national interest more than once kurdistan alliance which used state funds to change the demography of the iraqi kirkuk through adoption of the amount of twenty million dinars every arab who wishes to leave for preserving
458469 that the recent escalation carried out by members of kurds in the governorate of kirkuk is unjustified and unworkable because the first paragraph of article iii of the constitution which they have based stipulates that all measures to create or join the province are not only after the election of provincial assemblies in accordance with the constitution of the iraqi headquarters in 2005 and which formed the provincial assemblies before it is approved
458470 disrupt the country over the past five years and to impede the process of construction investment and political reconstruction in iraq via the three main objection to your laws oil and gas investment and the election of provincial assemblies as well as disrupt the process of constitutional amendments in parliament
458471 the kurdish sides confidence in its ability to obtain all meant to sectarianism which tore apart iraq and divided the arabs along with sunni and one shiite kurdish making more powerful position
458472 the kurdistan alliance which calls for national consensus for so long was the first to violate this agreement as happened in the governorate of kirkuk
458473 threats to the territorial government to take other measures that have not got murad in kirkuk brandishing secession accompanied the political process since the fall of the former regime
458474 the fruit production during the current season has seen a marked increase and increase the volume of fruit production in the region amounted to 50 compared to last year
458475 the lack of snow and frost provided the atmosphere and climatic conditions helped to increase production in northern regions of the province which is the main source of fruit
458476 no appearance of agricultural pests on fruit trees contributed to the intensity of production
458477 the constituency continues to support farmers financially to transport their crops to markets
458478 the ministry of agriculture has allocated one billion dinars for the transfer of production of farmers
458479 the actions taken to reduce the importation of seasonal fruits through the imposition of additional customs duties on imported fruits to encourage local production and the department of agriculture in dahuk began construction of six refrigerated warehouses in the judicial zakho and amadiyah keeping the product of the agricultural damage
458480 his farm has seen an increase in production during the current season to the extent that many of the branches of fruit trees have broken up because of heavy production
458481 has an area of five dunums of land planted with fruit trees the annual production to about 40 tons of fruit
458482 most of the regions farmers were forced to sell their produce at cheap prices are not worth a minimum of their fear of exposure to damage because of the marketing of fruit in the region
458483 the need to protect agricultural products and find outlets for marketing and the establishment of laboratories food industries region to be able to continue their work
458484 recession witnessed by the local fruit market due to inability of the regions farmers from sending their produce to the central and southern regions because of the unstable security situation in those areas
458485 80 of the fruit before allawi in dohuk are produced locally as it is overflowing from the need for the consumer
458486 the regions farmers lack expertise in marketing one important factor in the inability of farmers to compete with imported products since domestic production is still packed in boxes spontaneously unprepared raises suspicion of quality product to the consumer
458487 in while find imported fruits arranged clean and attractive as well earning consumer confidence by quickly
458488 transactions 7500 draft bar in baghdad had been completed and transferred to banks for the receipt of the beneficiaries of loans allocated to them while the transactions were completed 39 thousand and 864 projects in other provinces
458489 project loans which was launched in march 2007 included four categories of work are unemployed graduates families who lost breadwinners due to terrorist operations and the displaced and the owners of the assignee affected by acts of violence
458490 have been identified loan between 4 10 million dinars estimated by special committees depending on the nature of the project and only 2 interest rate paid to state banks to repay the loan during the period of 8 years
458491 it was allocating 60 million dollars in 2008 for each of the governorates of baghdad basra and mosul and 30 million dollars to each governorate other
458492 the state would bear the interest rate and the amount of 2
458493 million were registered and 234 thousand jobless people to work until the end of last july while the operation was 234 thousand and 433 jobless people during the same period

458496 during the month and nearly half the current witnessed a rise in iron prices have been the price per square metre rose 12 thousand to twenty thousand which led to a significant rise in real estate
458497 i am in favor of a scheduled us troop withdrawal from iraq over an agreed period of time during which iraq should be cleansed of all militias and the iraqi army should be built up
458498 our ultimate objective is to see all foreign troops out of iraq as soon as possible but first we have to ensure that we have a capable military power with national allegiance the timeline is dependant on the time needed to have our forces ready which is a decision to be made by the army leadership in relation to its ability to ensure internal security and protect iraq against external threats
458499 i dont have anything against granting regions more freedoms and i support decentralization but iraq is in need of a strong centralized government federalism should be based on the administrative requirements of the state not on ethnic and sectarian foundations anything else would lead to the division of iraq and the end of it as a state
458500 our view is that the differences over the oil and gas law will remain as long as the constitution is not amended with regards to the authorities it grants the regions at the expense of the central government
458501 kirkuk is an arab province whether they kurds like it or not there is no national consensus over a solution to this dispute and thats why kirkuk has to be treated differently from other provinces

458524 the labour group is once again jumping in before they have the full facts
458525 the preferred option of the executive is purely a recommendation to go before full council on august 13 where councillors will be able to air their views in a democratic process
458526 the executive meeting held on monday was not secret but held in private as permitted by the constitution
458527 minutes from this meeting have been published on the councils website
458528 i think it is very wrong to accuse this council of lacking openness transparency and accountability when i have personally kept people informed of the process every step of the way

458539 the only ads on wordpress com are the ones automattic puts onto your blog but hides from you if youre logged in
458540 you could even have ads for causes or companies you dont support on your wordpress site
458541 while meg hasnt set up cute overload in the way that youd prefer
458542 i see this mistaken assertion made often enough about typepad that i have to wonder if someone out there is deliberately misstating what the system can do
458543 and typepad simply blows wordpress com away on seo when it comes to search engine indexing typepad delivers your blog posts directly to google reader and my yahoo and blogline
458544 on wordpress com youre kind of moving into a bad neighborhood by their own admission one third of the blogs on wordpress com are spam
458545 you seem to know more than enough about seo to know what that implies
458546 on typepad you can make a password protected blog and share it with as many people as you want to grant access to on wordpress com itll cost money if you want to invite more than a certain number of people to have passwords on your site
458547 extensibility lets talk about what normal people who arent php coders can do
458548 for self hosted options movable type is free open source and its just irresponsible to misrepresent the fact that mt is open source
458549 and mt is dramatically more secure than wordpress org and thats according to the department of homeland securitys own statistics
458550 but of course theres no mt mu and thats because mt was intelligently designed from its very first release almost seven years ago to support multiple blogs
458551 its not a separate fork with its own set of plugins and themes
458552 and its not just possible to host blogs for others with it its the sort of thing thats done on the scale of major league baseball offering free mt blogs to anyone who wants one
458553 sentencing your friend to a blog where he cant run his own ads and his
458554 congratulations youre standing in the shadow of steve jobs so is every last iphone addon mac peripheral and ipod knockoff trying to bolster your company through secondary affiliations like that indicate that you cant stand on your own
458555 and if you want to forward the email you got id be happy to disabuse anyone of the notion that typepad antispam is based on akismet it couldnt be since akismet isnt open source and typepad antispam is
458556 this notification system of yours seems to be a public atom feed which only works when and if a search engine decides to consume it
458557 uh hmm what does it imply maybe i dont know what im talking about
458558 if you are catering to the type of blogger who wants to have ads on their site then youre catering to people less interested in providing content and more interested in earning a quick buck thats certainly an acceptable business strategy but not one i would lower myself to
458559 if you are catering to the type of blogger who wants to have ads on their site
458560 then youre catering to people less interested in providing content and more interested in earning a quick buck
458561 thats certainly an acceptable business strategy but not one i would lower myself to
458562 thats whats written in the requirements we cant change it now
458563 heres company x known as a genius at y and heres their process methodology etc
458564 es muy probable que en breve se alcance un acuerdo
458565 parece muy extra o que supieran algo puesto que hace unos d as ch vez estuvo con el rey juan carlos y nada se dijo de este asunto
458566 es la situaci n pol tica la que empuja al capital espa ol a querer dejar el pa s y buscar una salida de mercado
458567 hace tiempo que se quieren ir y ahora la puerta est abierta pero el verdadero temor es saber cu nto y c mo pagar ch vez
458568 las empresas espa olas est n en la regi n por una raz n mucho m s que econ mica es una decisi n estrat gica pero si en alg n caso se llega a la conclusi n de que tienen que irse se ir n
458569 el banco central de venezuela informa que en atenci n a las funciones que les han sido atribuidas constitucional y legalmente provee de manera permanente liquidez suficiente al sistema financiero asegurando as la disponibilidad de medios de pago para el normal funcionamiento de la econom a
458570 total confianza en la plena fortaleza del sistema por lo que no debe abrigarse ning n temor en cuanto a la normal continuidad de las operaciones
458571 la gente no conf a en el manejo que el gobierno har del banco
458572 anoche no pude dormir entre las llamadas de mis amigos que tienen cuenta en el banco y la preocupaci n m a
458573 es una mala se al porque el mensaje de ch vez es que no quiere inversiones
458574 temor porque los bancos que est n en manos del gobierno est n todos pr cticamente quebrados
458575 el estado no ten a un banco de verdad ch vez quiere m s y no va a parar aqu estamos apenas en el comienzo de un proceso de mayor alcance en la estatizaci n de la econom a venezolana
458576 as soon as you want to make money off of movable type or
458577 ok i have a wp blog like a lot of other bloggers i know
458578 website because typepad if used correctly can be used for website building
458579 weve had the naked chef who really wasnt naked at all but have you heard about naked dining this clip is actually from last year but it showcases a group who get together rent a room and dine in the buff together basically while its cold outside they shed their clothes sit down and chow down in their birthday suits
458580 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
458581 thats such a shame especially for the ones who were clean and its most important for the athletes who were second
458582 you lose that opportunity to stand on top of the podium and feel the joy of winning the race those are the people who hurt the worst when there are cheaters ahead of them giving back the medals is just a technicality because you cant repair the hurt feelings and the hard work that went into it
458583 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
458584 ive never wanted to do anything remotely close to doping its never ever crossed my mind ive never been approached about doing it its never been an issue my entire career its the last thing i would ever do

458623 we komen hier elk jaar vorig jaar zijn we weggegaan voor het vuurwerk begon dat willen we dit jaar zeker niet missen
458624 daar waren de wachtrijen echt absurd lang hier gaat het allemaal veel sneller nee walibi heeft onze voorkeur hoor
458625 politics in israel is very single issue people formulate their opinions on the basis of the arab israel conflict
458626 the israelis know and understand mccains positions obamas are surrounded with uncertainty
458627 the percentage of jews who involve themselves in party affairs as policymakers and fund raisers is probably higher than that of any other racial religious or ethnic group the result is that jews play a role in the political life of the country whose significance far transcends their proportion of the total population
458628 they vote in greater proportions than any other ethnic or religious grouping ninety two percent of all jews vote in national elections compared to only 54 percent of the people as a whole jews may only be 10 6 percent of new york state but they are between 16 percent and 20 percent of the voters
458629 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
458630 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
458631 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
458632 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
458633 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
458634 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
458635 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
458636 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things
458637 im like well does that mean were really not ready for a black president
458638 de los casos nuevos recibidos el 41 son de apelaciones de polic as estatales un 13 a polic as municipales y un 26 a los funcionarios de la administraci n de correcci n en el 12 que hubo revocaciones no implica una exoneraci n
458639 en t rminos de querellas que sean de ciudadanos en contra de polic as son mayormente contra estatales luego le siguen los polic as municipales en los ltimos tres a os no hemos tenido ninguna querella contra otros funcionarios con poder de arresto del ejecutivo
458640 la mayor parte de los casos que recibimos como querella usualmente hay una mayor proporci n de casos de abuso f sico lo que es imperdonable
458641 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
458642 so far washington has put its political capital into trying to refinance salvageable homes for unsalvageable homeowners when a relevant policy would consist of judiciously buying unsalvageable houses and demolishing them fannie and freddies strength is housing market software they could be put to work devising a least cost maximum bang strategy for demolishing unoccupied homes to preserve as much value as possible for the homeowners and mortgage creditors who remain
458643 of course right now their fannie freddies overriding imperative is to avoid recognizing losses rather than rushing toward them which is why fannie and freddie should be nationalized and later privatized

458648 by freeing a murderer like de juana chaos the government has turned us into orphans
458649 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
458650 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
458651 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
458652 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
458653 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
458654 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
458655 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
458656 and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but well work on it and we will deal with any potential grievances
458657 i came back from kirkuk half an hour ago the situation is very tense there
458658 the kurds want to lay bricks for an independent state but escalating tensions will not bring any good to anyone
458659 why is the peshmerga kurdish militia in the centre of kirkuk
458660 kirkuk is a city under the rule of the central government and must remain as it is
458661 whenever america targets and kills innocent people it comes up with such propaganda that it has killed a big personality in an attempt to justify the cruelty it has done
458662 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
458663 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
458664 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
458665 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
458666 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
458667 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
458668 combining current and historic video with state of the art computer animation the virtual exhibit takes a worlds fair approach to nasa history featuring pavilions that host each decade of the agencys challenges and achievements visitors will get unique insight into nasas activities over the years including a wide range of exploration and research initiatives and a glimpse into the future
458669 were very excited to have people come and take a look at nasas history weve been able to take a wide range of material and weave it into a virtual tour that allows people to explore at their own pace
458670 historic and cultural figures of the past 50 years of aerospace history including astronauts presidents astronomers and other popular icons associated with nasas history
458671 for example in the 1970s pavilion visitors will see a presentation of nasas voyager and viking missions hosted by an avatar of the late astronomer carl sagan complete with excerpts from his popular television series
458672 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
458673 if the trend continues there wont be any elephants except in fenced areas with a lot of enforcement to protect them
458674 the situation is worse than ever before and the public is unaware
458675 its very serious because elephants are an incredibly important species they keep habitats open so other species that depend on such ecosystems can use them without elephants there will be major habitat changes with negative effects on the many species that depend on the lost habitat
458676 elephants also are a major part of ecotourism which is an important source of hard currency for many african countries
458677 public support stopped the illegal ivory trade back in 1989 and can do so again
458678 the work with dna sampling allows us to focus law enforcement on poaching hot spots
458679 it forces countries to take more responsibility for what goes on within their borders and it also gives us more insight on where to look so that hopefully we can stop the poachers before the elephants are actually killed

458690 our oklahoma team in bangkok is designing disaster response and water purification modules to train burmese nationals who will be taking the information and skills back with them
458691 we have opened a number of fronts for funneling aid materials into the most needed areas
458692 we have some in country on ground resources helping with initial relief efforts and feeding us information
458693 they are helping us make more contacts and establish other channels for more aid to go in
458694 in this way they journeyed at the command of the lord and stopped where he told them to then remained there as long as the cloud stayed
458695 the world has said so zimbabwe has said so so its an exercise in self delusion
458696 we urge the united states government to reject the global warming agreement that was written in kyoto japan in december 1997 and any other similar proposals
458697 it should prepare us for anything we could see over the entirety of the season were particularly excited about our home schedule which will be very demanding and exciting for our fans we cant wait to get started
458698 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
458699 lifting the ban would create new opportunities for american workers and businessmen
458700 but the leaders of the democratic congress have refused to allow a vote
458701 the president knows that the impact of any new drilling will be insignificant promising savings of only pennies per gallon many years down the road
458702 jessie and memphis are on the block together because they are buddies
458703 tout ce qui est faux concernant notre client et ses amis les diverses assertions qui violent leur vie priv e et celles concernant le dispositif de s curit encore en place
458704 rien de semblable ni de pr s ni de loin nest jamais arriv au cours des neuf ans pendant lesquels jai re u une protection polici re je veux simplement prot ger ma r putation de ce ramassis de mensonges

458708 so the information campaigns that we have had in the past have been fairly successful but we feel that working with community based organizations with faith based organizations will also be crucial to getting the message across to those who consider risking their lives spending their savings on smugglers networks
458709 there is also this myth that if you make it to yemen or if you make it to the gulf countries you have chances of sending money back to the family of helping the family that has stayed back home so people will follow a dream they will take huge risks
458710 now there is obviously a much darker side to this because for instance many women and girls who have made it to yemen who have made it to the gulf countries find themselves in trafficking networks in other words they are exploited mostly for labor
458711 the dying the cripple the mental the unwanted the unloved they are jesus in disguise
458712 the dying the cripple the mental the unwanted the unloved they are jesus in disguise
458713 now get this straight even if we or an angel fresh out of heaven preaches to you any other message than the one we preached to you to hell with him
458714 we dont necessarily know all the impacts but we know enough to know that they are being catastrophic
458715 the ecological balance of the great lakes is at a tipping point and the question is can they recover or can we act quickly enough to help them recover
458716 i do like your christ i do not like your christians your christians are so unlike your christ
458717 the dying the cripple the mental the unwanted the unloved they are jesus in disguise
458718 have you heard the news theres been a massive bomb blast in nairobi people have died and buildings have been destroyed
458719 we did find some areas where although he initially resisted he came around
458720 it was a classic strategy of giving the president things he doesnt want in bills he has to have
458721 in the eighth year of the presidency and in this environment bushs veto was pretty strong
458722 he had to compromise and he had to do it in two ways either they negotiated out a compromise or he was pushed into a compromise politically because of where the votes were
458723 the president doesnt get involved much with what goes on around here
458724 talking about a second stimulus package right now is premature
458725 well fight if we must but wed much rather dance
458726 in now way do i think john mccain s campaign was being racist
458727 i think theyre cynical i think they want to distract people about the real issues
458728 i dont think its accurate to say that my comments have nothing to do with race
458729 heres what i was saying that i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races for a whole range of reasons im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama i am african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia
458730 i think that what has been an approach from the mccain campaign is to say hes risky to try to divert focus from the fact that they dont have any new ideas
458731 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
458732 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
458733 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
458734 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
458735 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
458736 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
458737 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
458738 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
458739 an exceptionally gifted politician who throughout his life has been able to make people of wildly divergent vantage points see in him exactly what they want to see
458740 the higher he soared the more this politician spoke in well worn platitudes and the more he offered warm feel good sentiments lacking a precise framework
458741 we are not shocked when a candidate moves to the center for the general election but mr obamas shifts are striking because he was the candidate who proposed to change the face of politics the man of passionate convictions who did not play old political games
458742 this whole notion that i am shifting to the center
458743 the people who say this apparently havent been listening to me
458744 i dont want to just end the war i want to end the mindset that got us into war
458745 i must confess that my enthusiasm for senator obama has waned in recent weeks with a number of his policy announcements on fisa gun control etc while i of course will vote for him and help him get elected i must say that i feel a bit deflated after having put so much hope effort and money into his candidacy
458746 some diminished enthusiasm for the presumptive democratic nominee and only small gains among independent voters
458747 t bem eu considero o que voc disse vamos tentar
458748 se voc n o conseguiu o que voc queria a culpa sua
458749 nuestro juicio es que estos ataques despiadados fueron obra del sangriento grupo separatista

458761 credit cards historically have been a very profitable segment for the banking industry so what theyre doing is trying to squeeze customers as much as they can particularly for accounts they dont see as profitable or as high risk
458762 the credit cards raise the rates when they go up they should go down when interest rates go down

458812 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
458813 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
458814 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured

458822 when it clouds up it gains a lot of grip and a lot of speed when the sun breaks out it gets slick and greasy that has a lot to do with the outcome of the race and hopefully it will be just fine
458823 i think we had a pretty good baseline last time here we were pretty happy with our race car so well go back and look at those notes a lot and take what we learned yesterday with the track being a good bit different for us and try to incorporate that all into a best educated guess on what we want
458824 theres always a menu of stuff that we would like to try to improve our car like everyone else

458831 i was there when pat amp christa got hitched in mexico
458832 indeed under the law almost everything is purified with blood and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these
458833 continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to god that is the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name
458834 not neglect to do good and to share what you have for such sacrifices are pleasing to god
458835 i appeal to you therefore brethren by the mercies of god to present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god which is your spiritual worship
458836 for to me to live is christ and to die is gain
458837 even if i am to be poured as a libation upon the sacrificial offering of your faith i am glad and rejoice with you all
458838 for there is one god and there is one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself as a ransom for all the testimony to which was borne at the proper time
458839 therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance since a death has occurred which redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant
458840 teacher what good deed must i do to have eternal life
458841 why do you ask me about what is good one there is who is good if you would enter life keep the commandments
458842 you shall not kill you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness honor your father and mother and you shall love your neighbor as yourself
458843 all these i have observed what do i still lack
458844 if you would be perfect go sell what you possess and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come follow me
458845 if any one comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters yes and even his own life he cannot be my disciple
458846 therefore i tell you every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven and whoever says a word against the son of man will be forgiven but whoever speaks against the holy spirit will not be forgiven either in this age or in the age to come
458847 for if we sin deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins but a fearful prospect of judgment and a fury of fire which will consume the adversaries a man who has violated the law of moses dies without mercy at the testimony of two or three witnesses how much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by the man who has spurned the son of god and profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified and outraged the spirit of grace
458848 by rejecting conscience certain persons have made shipwreck of their faith among them hymenaeus and alexander whom i have delivered to satan that they may learn not to blaspheme
458849 i tell you on the day of judgment men will render account for every careless word they utter for by your words you will be justified and by your words you will be condemned
458850 doesnt it make you feel bad when you think about how much jesus had done by this age

458854 because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which i commanded you you shall not eat of it cursed is the ground because of you in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life thorns and thistles it shall bring forth to you and you shall eat the plants of the field in the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground for out of it you were taken you are dust and to dust you shall return

458986 tell me once more how progressives love free speech online activists thought to be loyal to barack obama are once against using googles software tools to target rival political blogs for elimination as spam blogs this occurred earlier this year when democratic bloggers with a preference for hillary clinton also found themselves locked out of their own blogs all because of spurious and apparently orchestrated claims that these blogs are spam blogs pro obama activists were blamed for those attempts at censorship as well

459050 we entered into an arrangement with natalie in may for her to serve as the voice of ffe and to assist with various media and communication projects she is such a genuine and talented professional her understanding and appreciation of the trucking industry has enabled her to connect with drivers in a way that is different from any other recruiting campaign
459051 we are looking forward to the opportunity to introduce her publicly as the ffe spokesperson at the 2008 great american trucking show gats in dallas aug 21 23
459052 driver reach is amazing when you consider that one out of every 13 people working in the private sector in the united states is employed in a trucking related job nearly 50 000 people attended gats last year and attendance this year is expected to be higher this show is an important milestone for tidwell and ffe recruiting projects
459053 one of the biggest challenges for advertising agencies is to find a symbol or person to strengthen the branding position of a company natalie tidwell is a perfect person for this purpose she is talented attractive and has a real love for interacting with people
459054 its an exciting partnership for me we already have some podcasts print and commercial work planned
459055 utilizing a different website from our own is a new approach in marketing but the goal is to make ffe more visible to volumes of internet traffic that may not normally visit our site
459056 this is when america takes time to honor drivers for their hard work and commitment in tackling one of our economys most demanding and important jobs
459057 what better way to thank our drivers than to commission someone like natalie to serve as a public symbol of their hard work and dedication
459058 this year has been extremely challenging for companies in the trucking industry fuel costs have increased and the demand for freight has decreased in some areas ffe has always been on the cutting edge of marketing innovations and using natalie as a spokesperson allows them to put a face and a personality out front so that drivers employees and customers have someone to relate to in uncertain often tough economic winds
459059 i had already done it in the past in branson and they gave me the opportunity to do it again in pigeon forge tn i couldnt turn down the opportunity it gave me the facet to sing perform and make a great living as well
459060 the thing i liked most is that i never felt like i had to get their attention they have a great student professor ratio and i found the academic experience rewarding
459061 i knew all of my instructors so well it made a tremendous difference in the quality of my education
459062 after college he signed with the new england patriots transferred to the miami dolphins and later spent some time with nfl europe in barcelona
459063 he suffered a few injuries that put him out a bit but he returned and played in arena football leagues out of dallas new orleans and a few other areas before retiring if theres been one constant motivation for me its been tim
459064 we met after a game one night at the time he had a broken foot
459065 he liked me so much that he didnt mind walking me all the way back to my dorm broken foot and all i thought it was sweet and thats how it all started
459066 tu gave me the opportunity to shine my advertising professor mr hinkle and my marketing professor dr james cagley were always there to help that meant a lot to me
459067 what other school offers that much faculty attention that was one of the main reasons i loved tu it was just a remarkable experience and i think most of the student body would agree when i say it is one of the best schools to attend
459068 i just went up there and started singing my heart out to the song sleeping single in a double bed my parents knew right then and there that i was going to do that the rest of my life
459069 im excited about the upcoming events i have with ffe i love one on one time with fans and having the opportunity to meet with them
459070 serving as the voice of ffe is turning into quite an experience it is really wonderful my fan base is continually growing with the nicest people you could hope to meet
459071 gaining exposure is great but im doing this to help drivers and because i love to sing i am glad the music touches the fans in a personal way that is important to me
459072 a lot of drivers contact me through the website one particular ffe driver who just recently sent an email truly inspired something in me
459073 there is such a misconception about truck drivers what they do is hard work so many go above and beyond the call of duty and its all in a days work for them
459074 truckers spend so much time away from their families on the road day in and day out to keep america going if it were not for them all of our lives would be different
459075 their continuing efforts mean so much to our daily activities i am honored and so thankful to be in a position to help in whatever small way possible to lighten their load
459076 you were like a circle on the map a destination i was told to drive to we were touched by an angels wings i know its true cause baby here you are here you are

459087 heres my sobering discovery i learned that i could lead others in worshiping god and be worshiping something else in my own heart
459088 the better i e the more accurately we know god through his word the more genuine our worship will be in fact the moment we veer from what is true about god were engaging in idolatry
459089 in my experience this is rarely the emphasis among worship leaders godly example is too often assumed or ignored while public gifting is highlighted and exalted but paul cant imagine a leader whose personal life doesnt commend his message
459090 if our leadership focuses on musical experiences well reap a desire for better sounds cooler progressions and more creative arrangements if we sow to immediate feelings well reap meetings driven by the pursuit of emotional highs if we lead in such a way that were the center of attention well reap a man centered focus shallow compliments and ungodly comparisons
459091 our churches cant be spirit led unless theyre word fed
459092 being emotionally affected by music and actually worshiping god arent the same thing
459093 biblical worship involves proclamation and leads to proclaiming truth with our lives were doing more than emoting or having worship experience were declaring why god is so great what he has accomplished and all that he has promised we all need to be reminded and proclamation helps us remember
459094 was it a beautiful sunset or was it just the suns rays interacting with the atmosphere and dust particles that made it look that way
459095 with deep respect for those whove gone before us in our church we attempt to follow three principles for ordering our services 1 do what god clearly demands 2 dont do what god clearly forbids 3 use scriptural wisdom for everything else we recognize that god hasnt given us a prescribed order of service that defines biblical worship but we seek to faithfully apply biblical precepts and examples
459096 i dont believe what god has said about me in the cross i think there must be some aspect of my life however small or pitiful thats praiseworthy meritorious and beyond inspection

459117 it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise revenues in the long run is to cut rates now the purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a budgetary deficit but to achieve the more prosperous expanding economy which will bring a budgetary surplus

459123 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
459124 thats such a shame especially for the ones who were clean and its most important for the athletes who were second
459125 you lose that opportunity to stand on top of the podium and feel the joy of winning the race those are the people who hurt the worst when there are cheaters ahead of them giving back the medals is just a technicality because you cant repair the hurt feelings and the hard work that went into it

459143 prime minister gilani said that he would conduct an independent investigation
459144 he said he would look into the matter and try and get to the root of it
459145 so the two prime ministers naturally reviewed where we are in the process of normalising an improving india pak relations
459146 the indian prime minister was relatively frank in expressing his concerns about recent events which have had an impact on the relationship and on the prospects of the dialogue
459147 both sides expressed the determination that we need to overcome these events and to move back on to the track of improving relations
459148 it was a candid and open conversation between two people who both wanted to see a way forward in this situation
459149 we have not had any discussion or agreement of the so called timeline of two weeks
459150 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006
459151 this figure is roughly 40 percent higher than cdcs former estimate of 40 000 infections per year which was based on limited data and less precise methods
459152 the data really confirm that there is a severe impact of this epidemic among gay and bisexual men in the united states as well as black men and women
459153 it also mirrors what we see about sexually transmitted diseases and changes in risk behavior among men who have sex with men
459154 the reality is that it is a wake up call for all of us
459155 there are things that you and i can do to stop the disease encourage others to use condoms consistently and correctly abstain from sex
459156 in fact cdcs analysis suggests that the epidemic has been roughly stable since the late 1990s though the number of new hiv infections remains unacceptably high
459157 the analysis shows that new infections peaked in the mid 1980s at approximately 130 000 infections per year and reached a low of about 50 000 in the early 1990s

459172 wrong vote regrettable many democrats will do this we should be standing up for the constitution when sen obama is president he will im sure work to fix some of this but its going to be a lot easier to prevent it now than to try to fix it later
459173 sen obama we are a proud group of your supporters who believe in your call for hope and a new kind of politics please reject the politics of fear on national security vote against this bill and lead other democrats to do the same

459233 ultimately what i think weve got to do is keep driving home the essential message of this campaign that weve got to change business as usual

459262 die zusammenarbeit mit den h ndlern ist uns sehr wichtig da geht es sehr famili r zu besonders bei den l den die wir seit zehn jahren beliefern
459263 es geht um einen berlebenskampf bei dem man nicht wissen soll in welcher zeit er spielt wir sind dann w hrend der produktion des albums gemeinsam mit der band lied f r lied durchgegangen und haben das in klamotten umgesetzt

459277 i think weve all arrived at a very special place spiritually ecumenically grammatically
459278 there are some people who have faced incredible hard times and have been forced to re home their pets
459279 not everyone admits they are leaving their pets because of the economy or their homes are being foreclosed on but we are hearing about it more
459280 some of them have come to us very thin and filthy
459281 we recently found a deceased cat when a bank came to a foreclosed home
459282 nearly half of those are euthanized because they are too young or too old
459283 and the shelters dont have the resources to care for them or there is no space in the shelters
459284 its not surprising when times are difficult for people its difficult for pets too
459285 if families want to keep their pets there is help out there
459286 if they have trouble buying food we can help them
459287 its a vital service that the town is providing and its a service that is ever increasing
459288 im a yankee and ive got fishhooks in my pocket when it comes to money but the library is one thing i support

459313 detroit is our big city and to the extent that its facing these tremendous challenges its not good for michigan
459314 it has taken many years for the district to get in the shape its in now
459315 lately in our city and schools people are looking for people to blame and the politicians have a lot to bear when it comes to being accountable for what is happening here

459321 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
459322 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
459323 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
459324 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
459325 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
459326 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
459327 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
459328 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

459353 the assumption that an advanced species will want to create a simulated universe relies too heavily on the idea that they will share our moral standards we cannot make such an assumption so the likelihood that we exist in a simulated universe may be a great deal lower than originally thought i am not saying that it is impossible all i am suggesting is that more thought needs to be put into the look of future moral reasoning before we can rest the simulated universe argument on this assumption

459358 then why would anybody choose a bad lifetime a horror movie
459359 but some people spend a lot of money and time to see horror or soap opera problems that to other people are dull and boring
459360 you dont have to see their films and they dont have to see yours that is called freedom
459361 but why would anybody want to be horrified or bored
459362 we are game playing fun having creatures we are the otters of the universe we cannot die we cannot hurt ourselves any more than illusions on the screen can be hurt but we can believe were hurt in whatever agonizing detail we want we can believe were victims killed and killing shuddered around by good luck and bad luck
459363 we buy tickets to these films paying admission by agreeing to believe in the reality of space and the reality of time neither one is true but anyone who doesnt want to pay that price cannot appear on this planet or in any space time system at all

459382 what the naturalist believes is that ultimate fact the thing you go behind is a vast process in space and time which is going on of its own accord inside that total system every particular event such as you reading this book in this case this post happens because some other event has happened in the long run because the total event is happening each particular thing such as this page is what it is because other things are what they are and so eventually because the whole system is what it is all the things and events are so completely interlocked that no one of them can claim the slightest independence from the whole show none of them exists on its own or goes on of its own accord except in the sense that it exhibits at some particular place and time that general existence on its own or behaviour of its own accord which belongs to nature the great total interlocked event as a whole thus no thoroughgoing naturalist believes in free will for free will would mean that human beings have the power of independent action the power of doing something more or other than what was involved by the total series of events and any such seperate power of originating events is what the naturalist denies spontaneity originality action on its own is a privilege reserved for the whole show which he calls nature

459384 the world does not consist of 100 per cent christians and 100 per cent non christians there are people a great many of them who are slowly ceasing to be christians but who still call themselves by that name some of them are clergymen there are other people who are slowly becoming christians though they do not yet call themselves so there are people who do not accept the full christian doctrine about christ but who are strongly attracted by him that they are his in a much deeper sense then they themselves understand there are people in other religions who are being led by gods secret influence to concentrate on those parts of their religion which are in agreement with christianity and who thus belong to christ without knowing it for example a buddhist of good will may be led to concentrate more and more on the buddhist teaching about mercy and to leave in the background though he might still say he believed the buddhist teaching on certain other points many of the good pagans long before christs birth may have been in this position and always of course there are a great many people who are just confused in mind and have a lot of inconsistent beliefs all jumbled up together consequently it is not much use trying to make judgements about christians and non christians in the mass it is some use comparing cats and dogs or even men and women in the mass because there one knows definitely which is which also an animal does not turn either slowly or suddenly from a dog into a cat but when we are comparing christians in general with non christians in general we are usually not thinking about real people whom we know at all but only about two vague ideas which we have got from novels and newspapers if you want to compare the bad christian and the good athiest you must think about two real specimens whom you have actually met unless we come down to brass tacks in that way we shall only be wasting time

459398 finally at the age of 3 we had him diagnosed with higher functioning autism by a visiting physiologist from west palm beach we live in the cayman islands so having the resources on a small caribbean island is very difficult it was even more difficult to obtain help for our son
459399 i would not accept that therapy was the only way my son would recover so i did what jenny mccarthy said in her book
459400 dan is very costly 360 per hour is not easy to swallow then on top of that are all the tests and then the supplements wow in one year it has cost us close to 20 000 factor in that a private therapist speech ot flights and other travel costs to tampa and you can buy a house in 3 years

459427 hij is er momenteel mentaal niet voor 100 procent bij
459428 het duurt nu al drie weken daarom heb ik vandaag tegen hem gezegd je speelt niet
459429 dat is misschien logisch omdat het op een aantal posities anders was ingevuld bij ons maar ik heb het nog wel uitgebreid op beeld laten zien
459430 we forceerden te veel we waren ook te veel onderweg als we eenmaal de bal pakten dan gaven we hem weer moeiteloos aan de tegenpartij nu kan dat nog volgende week niet meer
459431 hij speelde nog te diep op het middenveld maar het was ook zijn eerste wedstrijd
459432 hij moet een tandje erbij doen en agressiever worden ik ga het daar nog wel met hem over hebben

459455 as things stand perhaps to look at an inflation rate of 8 9 per cent will be a difficult thing but probably we will do it by march 2009
459456 you can get a much lower rate of inflation if there is confluence of favourable factors such as moderation in oil prices and so on otherwise if the oil prices remain at the prevailing rate that is best estimate for inflation
459457 as far as growth is concerned it will slow down it will slow down than what we have experienced in previous years but nevertheless i think we can still hope to have gdp growth of economy between 7 5 to 8 per cent

459466 murali and mendis have a lot of variation and its very difficult you cannot be predetermined to go at them because they have so much variety that you need to react after they deliver the ball
459467 one thing i wanted to do with delhi was that it should hurt when they start losing we have seen all kinds of lows in the previous seasons we faced relegation a couple of seasons back and we wanted to prove a point this season
459468 so far in this match weve really played them well and set the game for our bowlers to turn this around
459469 murali and mendis have a lot of variation and its very difficult but you have to take whatever they throw against you thats the best way to go you cannot be predetermined to go at them because they have so much variety that you need to react after they deliver the ball
459470 out of mendiss fingers because most of his variations come from there
459471 the ball was drifting a bit and the one that got me drifted much more
459472 and im disappointed at not having made a hundred it was one of those dismissals but i hope to handle mendis well till the end of the series
459473 prime minister gilani said that he would conduct an independent investigation
459474 he said he would look into the matter and try and get to the root of it

459496 the singular feature of the great crash of 1929 was that the worst continued to worsen what looked one day like the end proved on the next day to have been only the beginning nothing could have been more ingeniously designed to maximize the suffering and also to ensure that as few as possible escaped the common misfortune the fortunate speculator who had funds to answer the first margin call presently got another and equally urgent one and if he met that there would still be another in the end all the money he had was extracted from him and lost the man with the smart money who was safely out of the market when the first crash came naturally went back in to pick up bargains not only were a recorded 12 894 650 shares sold on 24 october precisely the same number were bought the bargains then suffered a ruinous fall even the man who waited out all of october and all of november who saw the volume of trading return to normal and saw wall street become as placid as a produce market and who then bought common stocks would see their value drop to a third or a fourth of the purchase price in the next twenty four months the coolidge bull market was a remarkable phenomenon the ruthlessness of its liquidation was in its own way equally remarkable

459504 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
459505 people who have saved for retirement will be made to pay for those who havent which means you need to save even more
459506 plenty of people are already borrowing from their 401 k retirement accounts the most recent industry surveys show that about 20 to 25 percent of eligible employees have outstanding loans

459510 the determination and strong purpose shown by gordon are why he will lead us into the next election and win the confidence of the country all of us are focused on that
459511 we do not want a summer of leadership speculation we have got a good case to make and we should get out there and make it all this leadership speculation gets in the way of us putting our message across
459512 we will make a fatal error by not giving gordon a chance to roll out his plans yes he is a serious bloke dare i say he make come over a bit boring hes not a trained actor hes a deep thinker let me tell you this fellow is no mug
459513 we will be releasing info when we can and will do our best to answer your questions the good news is that im not reading anything on this forum that is out of keeping with our current plans well also be running some beta tests at some stage so we can test online handling etc it would be good to get some of you involved in this well post an announcement closer to the time

459541 well your conventional engineer would be yes but these are a sort of not only are they afraid of mobile phones but they also want to frankly its

459561 one third of british muslim students say its acceptable to kill for islam
459562 the findings were described by researchers at the centre for social cohesion think tank which commissioned the poll as deeply alarming
459563 let me finish by briefly furnishing you with my own research on csc they have a neocon agenda and their director douglas murray indeed wrote a book entitled pim fortuyn memorial conference in 2006 conditions for muslims in europe must be made harder across the board fortuyn was famous for saying islam was and that he was in favour of a cold war with islam social cohesion indeed the csc shares a building with policy exchange another rightwing stinktank last year pe were subject of a newsnight investigation which claimed to have uncovered damning evidence that they had forged receipts of extremist literature they said they purchased from britains mosques its head said he would sue the bbc we are all still waiting the dodgy reports author
459564 one third of british muslim students say its acceptable to kill for islam
459565 40 per cent want to see the introduction of islamic sharia law in britain
459566 how supportive if at all would you be of the official introduction of shariah law into british law for muslims in britain
459567 if officials wanted to introduce some or all aspects of shariah law into the uk for muslims only would you support their move
459568 do you think shariah law should be introduced into the uk it may seem like wordplay but wordplay is critically important in understanding results from polls like this and how they can be misinterpreted
459569 do not think men and women are equal in the eyes of allah
459570 an article the other day saying we should be kinder to muslims and this is what they want to do to us
459571 yet its only us who can be acused of being racist our country is going to erupt one of these days
459572 im sure 100 of britons if you asked them would prefer these people to be deported
459573 such students when firmly identified must be immediately expelled and sent back to their home countries
459574 this tells us what we already know islam is not compatible with democracy yet the government allows this hate to be spread there should be no muslim unions at university or any other institution
459575 the evidence is all around us that islam is in conflict with everything that can regarded as civilised
459576 goody at last they start to show their true colours wake up the vipers are in the nursery

459580 waarschijnlijk voelden we allebei dat ons bestaan onaf was en dat een nieuw te verwerven iets zich aandiende om deze onafheid mee te vullen we stonden voor de deur die toegang gaf tot dat iets gedurende tien seconden wij twee n hand in hand onder een vaag flikkerend licht
459581 ik had fouten gemaakt maar misschien waren het geen echte fouten misschien waren het eerder onvervreemdbare karaktertrekken die ik in me had dan fouten dat was een heel sombere gedachte

459585 nothing could undermine the credibility of the intelligent design crowd faster than this dishonest venal attempt to make an end run around the legitimate scientific vetting process
459586 this is probably one of the worst movies ive seen last year
459587 fortunately my boyfriend and i were the only people in the theaters which allowed us to yell at the screen freely
459588 90 minutes of your life you will never get back
459589 it merely exposes intelligent design advocates as the fundamentalist nutcases that they really are
459590 i am offended as a biologist a christian and a human
459591 i sat for an interminable period of time in stunned silence
459592 i gave it one star because the dvd might serve as a pretty good coaster
459593 i should have known better when the expelled theater consisted only of me my girlfriend and my friend on a busy saturday night well in all fairness there was another couple who walked out in the first 20 minutes no doubt to get their money back and salvage the rest of their evening
459594 if film technology had existed at the time of copernicus then the catholic church would have made a movie similar to expelled to convince people the sun revolves around the earth
459595 if you like this movie please seek help because you are a delusional easily influenced brain washed under achiever
459596 that was the year harry potter burst upon the american scene

459600 and with good reason they are dangerous and serve to draw people away from him furthermore the power behind spells and divination is demonic
459601 our only animosity toward christianity or toward any other religion is that these institutions have claimed to be the one true right and only way witches are sick and tired of people in other religions passing judgment and spreading lies about our belief system just because they are either insecure in their own faith or dont realize that many paths to god exist in our universe
459602 if your teen isnt an activist or practitioner in middle school or high school college is a fertile field for the growth of witch sympathies
459603 if we are debating claims of antiquity nothing is more ancient than the prohibitions against witchcraft and sorcery
459604 my son is now 11 and has not had an mmr the reason being that i have watched my nephew descend into autism after his mmr and i am afraid that whatever susceptibility my sisters son had will be shared by my son now i am wondering about giving my son a single measles vaccination as we are going to be living abroad in a place that has a higher incidence of measles than the uk he is normally healthy fit and eats well he is the top of his class i am terrified of ruining his life by giving him a measles vaccine or by not giving him one what are the extra risks of contracting measles later in life ie in the teenage years do the risks of complications increase with age can i deliberately contrive for him to have measles naturally how would i do that does anyone still have measles partys does anyone in scotland know of anywhere to get help a lot of questions hope someone has some guidance for me thanks
459605 measles is a dangerous disease there were 2 measles related deaths last year in the uk and in the lambeth area of london in may june more than 120 children were in intensive care as a consequence of complications from measles these children had not been vaccinated and therefore not protected
459606 patients with immune deficiency disorders and their household contacts should not be vaccinated

459614 lyndon larouche is the american demagogue who in 1989 received a 15 year sentence for conspiracy mail fraud and tax code violations he has claimed that the british royal family is running an international drugs syndicate that henry kissinger is a communist agent that the british government is controlled by jewish bankers and that modern science is a conspiracy against human potential
459615 the world glacier monitoring service in zurich switzerland in a paper published in science in 1989 noted that between 1926 and 1960 more than 70 percent of 625 mountain glaciers in the mid latitude united states soviet union iceland switzerland austria and italy were retreating after 1980 however 55 percent of these same glaciers were advancing
459616 they were then reproduced by the appropriately named junkscience com by the cooler heads coalition the us national centre for public policy research and countless others they have even found their way into the washington post
459617 between 1960 and 1980 on the basis of data for about 400 to 450 glaciers observed each year advancing glaciers are shown to have increased from about 6 of observed glaciers to 55 during the 1960 to 1980 period on the basis of data for about 50 glaciers observed each year annual mass balance is shown to be on the average positive for about 57 of observed glaciers in the european alps and for 40 of observed glaciers in the other monitored areas of the world
459618 the case of the mmr controversy provides an interesting case where for a relatively short period of time some research publicized in the media suggested a potential risk of serious side effects associated with a standard medical procedure and where there was a sharp behavioral response
459619 routine observation in the literature that parents with high levels of education have the highest uptake rates of childhood immunizations
459620 more educated individuals more quickly absorb new health related information
459621 immunization is a proven tool for controlling and even eradicating disease sparing people from suffering disability and death the world health organization estimate that in 2002 immunization averted about two million deaths the importance of trust in vaccines can hence hardly be overstated
459622 their results are interesting and counterintuitive they suggest that during the controversy education was negatively correlated with vaccine uptake

459633 we have to make sure we are prepared for every option
459634 but we will not let the second holocaust take place
459635 all options are on the table if there wont be a choice other than a nuclear iran or a military option its clear what our decision has to be
459636 before we can even begin to consider the prospect of force we need to pursue this diplomatic process

459644 la clase pol tica tiene que asumir con responsabilidad el tema de dialogar y avanzar y cuando no se puede avanzar se retrocede un poco pero se sigue haciendo los esfuerzos no hay que dejarlo tranquilo al gobierno hay que picotearlo de buena manera pero una cosa es un picot n de alacr n venenoso y otra la de un zancudo yo prefiero este ltimo para poder molestarlos pero no envenenarlos
459645 la idea es que hay que estar dialogando constantemente para hacer que vuelvan a la realidad y demostrar que nosotros no somos enemigos del gobierno que necesitamos desarrollar nuestros pueblos esa es la f rmula m gica que da resultados ayer veinti n presidentes regionales hablaron de manera honesta y expresaron su preocupaci n por el enfriamiento de la econom a y la paralizaci n de la inversi n p blica el ministro fue tambi n honesto

459648 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
459649 it was a friend of mines and i was just taking it back to him

459651 take your son your only son whom i love issac and travel just beyond the gates of the city across the floor of flaking leaves listen to them suck the stale air and breathe back the place that i will show you
459652 do not stretch out your hand against your son and do nothing to him
459653 it started with a low life next thing i knew they ripped me from my bed and then they took my blood type left a strange impression in my head i dont wanna be kept i dont wanna be caged i dont wanna be damned i dont wanna be broke i dont wanna be saved give me rolling hills so tonite can be the night so i can stand upon a thousand thrills cut me some slack i dont wanna go back i want new day in age
459654 we had some family problems that morning and i was not able to make it up there
459655 i do not know i am trying to call coach dickerson right now to see what i need to do i am pretty disappointed right now because i wanted to go ahead and commit but they wanted to evaluate me further i really do not know what to say
459656 they seem like they have a really good staff and i like the defense they run
459657 uab and marshall have offered me and i think auburn is getting close to offering me too
459658 no sir i was in summer school so i never had the time
459659 its really between tech and oklahoma state and notre dame
459660 even if i commit early i still plan on taking official visits to oklahoma state and notre dame
459661 id say its like a 99 9 percent chance ill commit somewhere before the end of august
459662 everything there is real nice the campus is great and i love the dorms they are all brand new
459663 plus the coaches said that they are graduating like six safeties this year and id probably be able to play early
459664 its really between tech and oklahoma state and notre dame
459665 even if i commit early i still plan on taking official visits to oklahoma state and notre dame
459666 boone pickens stadium at oklahoma state is supposed to be amazing
459667 and i really want to go there and see it for myself ive heard the new facilities are great and theyve spent a lot of money on all that
459668 i know senior defensive back jacob lacey pretty well he went to my high school but hes like four years ahead of me so we never played together hes just always telling me what a great place that is and how id be able to play early and make an impact there
459669 i think tradition is real important and they have great tradition at notre dame
459670 ive seen the movie rudy and i really want to go there and see whats its like
459671 notre dame is in indiana and it would be cool being closer to him
459672 they all give me advice melvin thinks i should wait and take all my visits my mom wants me to pick an academic school and my dad says he just wants me to go where im happy they all have an opinion
459673 i really want to compete for a starting job early and play as a freshman
459674 and i think i have the best chance to do that at texas tech
459675 now that its past us we know what we are with this team going forward for the next two months
459676 having met these guys eight hours ago everybodys been extremely positive
459677 you jump around with those guys i felt like id been here all year we were like little kids
459678 i wasnt as pinpoint as i had been in my earlier starts
459679 i know that every great pitcher has bad outings like this early in their careers but it doesnt make it any better
459680 his slider was nice and sharp and his fastball was hard he looked like he had his good stuff tonight
459681 we got something going and kept chipping away you like to see fight like that were a team with heart
459682 we felt we needed to try a different direction with the pitching staff a different voice a different message
459683 not that anything they were saying was wrong but sometimes players respond to different voices and were going to take that chance
459684 we dont ever try to project anything into the future
459685 we basically show up each day and play the game and just have faith that everythings going to be great at the end
459686 i believe theyre going to come through in the clutch and keep getting better
459687 you get a hangover this quick i dont think thats an excuse give their pitchers credit they pitched a good ballgame they played well and they beat us
459688 we had a lot of guys on base and we just didnt get key hits with men in scoring position
459689 when you do that youre not going to win ballgames
459690 overall whenever you go seven and give up one run and keep your team in the game especially against a guy like peavy its going to be a low scoring game and youve got to keep them in the game
459691 i want to give us a chance to win every time to be consistent i think i have been could it be better maybe
459692 i thought id be kind of all over the strike zone
459693 i had good command of the curveball and the fastball
459694 hopefully well get the offense going to have the chance to give the guys at the back end of the bullpen some days off
459695 this has not been a good homestand and weve got to bounce back
459696 to win games youve got to put everything together and we have not done that on this homestand
459697 these guys have done a great job and i just want to help them get to a common goal and thats winning a title
459698 i was just trying to see the ball and hit it he made a good pitch and got me out but tomorrows another day
459699 everybody can be pitched to but hes one person that can change a lineup and make hitters around him better
459700 if you make a bad pitch which i have against him at times hes going to do what he does best so to give him two singles today including an infield hit im pretty happy with that
459701 i havent had a good outing and ive put a lot of burden on the rest of the team
459702 you cant get down on yourself your teammates or anybody else for that matter im not going to be a selfish guy and say i wish i could be winning more my mindset is just to try to do my best to keep the team in the game and try to get wins
459703 if i didnt hit that double odalis would have stepped it up and probably giving up no hits
459704 i think i had a lot of confidence coming into this year
459705 i think that was the main issue for me proving to myself that i can play at this level
459706 i definitely didnt have as good of stuff as ive had in a while
459707 my offspeed was not very good but i had really good fastball command
459708 decided since jake was coming off a physical performance he could use the day off
459709 i think its always better to work on things with a hitter you can see how theyre reacting to your stuff
459710 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
459711 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
459712 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
459713 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
459714 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
459715 i could feel his cock hitting agains the bottom of my pussy
459716 at one point i thought i was going to pass out then i realized that he still had to stick it in my ass i had to take a deep breath
459717 i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time

459719 its time to press on with the reform policies i promise to do my utmost to create a society where the people can live with peace of mind
459720 i will work consistently to share the same views as the people
459721 that he knew it did happen but couldnt tell me anymore
459722 he is certain the 1947 roswell ufo crash was a true alien encounter
459723 years later some of the areas old timers and military intelligence officers close to the incident some facing the threat of severe penalties confided in him
459724 he is convinced the incident was a real encounter covered up by the government for over 61 years
459725 he happened to have been privileged enough to be in on the fact that weve been visited and that the ufo phenomena is real
459726 his belief was confirmed by various sources including members or former members of top secret military intelligence circles
459727 the ufo story is so secret that even presidents and top politicians including jimmy carter gerald ford and former arizona senator barry goldwater were denied access to the
459728 our pilots would chase them and they would chase us there were just too many incidents and reports to deny that there was nothing going on
459729 that there remains strong evidence possibly including photographs that 61 years after the crash has not been seen by the public
459730 i cant prove that but i certainly know that the so called alien autopsy photographs were fakes
459731 the parties agreed four years ago to stop spending taxpayer money on housing youth in hurtful illegal conditions

459736 will you regret it when youre 30 if you dont go
459737 our judgement is that this merciless attack was the work of the bloody separatist group
459738 those who helped those who gave shelter and those who took part in the attack have been caught
459739 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
459740 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
459741 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
459742 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
459743 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
459744 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
459745 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
459746 and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but well work on it and we will deal with any potential grievances
459747 we are continuing to work to have the organizers deliver what has been pledged what has been outlined
459748 we were talking about delaying aspects of the constellation program
459749 i told my staff that we are going to find an entirely diferent offset
459750 i want to make sure that nasa money does go into r amp d and that is important
459751 this is an administration that is anti science they have rejected science i want us to be a science based society
459752 and we have to do more than provide short term relief
459753 why dont you go ahead of me youve got only 1 thing ive got 4
459754 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
459755 you will have a veritable gift for obtaining big very big wins at games you will meet people who have sincere feelings for you
459756 my opinion of pat has changed over the years i used to think he was truly a man of the people but the longer he has been mayor the less i think of him as with most cities charlotte has three political parties dem rep and chamber of commerce pat is definitely the puppet of the coc here what is good for business is good for charlotte and pat very personable guy he has gotten a bunch of dems in these parts to vote for him but i dont trust him

459763 with his hands or with his words you dont deserve it
459764 i dont want to talk about it but i have definitely experienced abuse in a way that i would tell people to take their heart and run
459765 was i disappointed by his attitude not at all i found him to be very serious and focused
459766 he wanted to leave chelsea i am certain of that although it created a lot of anxiety for him and in fact he remained because of family matters
459767 he stayed for his father who he is extremely close to and for his whole environment therefore he was unable to create that split that they expected and we were hoping for
459768 jose mourinho did hope for this move but we knew it was going to be difficult
459769 but i think he cant improve enough in the liverpool reserve team
459770 he should play in the first division week by week
459771 of course its not a problem if he plays in the reserve team for one or two years but doing it for a longer period is just not good for his development
459772 i dont think that at liverpool he has a real chance to play besides torres keane voronin or kuyt
459773 if he could get into the senior team then it would be a fantastic success but i think its more likely that hed be loaned to another team or its worse he may stay with the reserves
459774 he was the most influential player in the dressing room he was probably the most consistent player with ledley king before he got injured
459775 i really thought robbie keane would have stayed there for the rest of his career
459776 a security researcher who was set to speak at the black hat hacker convention in las vegas next week on a previously undiscovered flaw in apples filevault encryption system has canceled his talk citing confidentiality agreements with the cupertino computer maker
459777 charles edge a researcher from georgia had been slated to discuss his research on a weakness that could be used to defeat filevault encryption on the mac but sometime last week black hat organizers pulled his name and presentation listing from its schedule of talks
459778 contacted via cell phone edge said he signed confidentiality agreements with apple which prevents him from speaking on the topic and from discussing the matter further
459779 edge should absolutely honor any legal agreements he signed with apple which he says is his biggest client
459780 but these kinds of reversals have a funny way of stoking the curiosity of the hacker community already an inquisitive bunch by nature

459783 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
459784 i cant think of a nicer place to sit this spring over a glass of ros and watch the boys and girls in the street outside smiling gaily to each other and wondering where to go for a nosh

459788 any chance mike milbury is around can you see if hell talk to me so we can settle this like gentlemen
459789 this is getting stupid mike youre a coach at heart like me cmon for everyones sake lets put this behind us and act like pros
459790 that was impressive hes going to be a great coach in this league
459791 sharon and louis made it very clear they didnt think i should be there by the end of the series sharon made it public that she didnt like me
459792 i still dont know what i did to deserve that kind of treatment it was very hard because i had so much new stuff to learn i was three years behind everyone else and it was interesting that they kind of went out of their way to make it as difficult for me as possible
459793 theres nothing sharon can say that will make me feel angry or bad i couldnt live my life the way she lives her life im just happy for her to get on with it and ill stay out of the way
459794 all of her comments and behaviour say so much about her and nothing about me i know who i am and what i do and how i conduct myself and im secure in that
459795 theres a secret that comes out that if youre a true fan youre just going to die its a good angela secret and its not about her powers

459800 is this going to result in a kind of blessed censorship of a whole host of areas of medical care and research
459801 that would deny federal funding to any hospital clinic health plan or other entity that does not accommodate employees who want to opt out of participating in care that runs counter to their personal convictions including providing birth control pills iuds and the plan b emergency contraceptive
459802 its a redefinition of abortion that does not match any of the current medical definitions its ideologically based and not based on science and could interfere with the development of many new therapies to treat diseases
459803 friend if i did not give you a sermon you have given me one and by the grace of god i will never play the fool to preach before my lord mayor in such a manner again
459804 every verse and every sentence of james is explained expounded and enforced plainly clearly and usefully and far more fully than in most commentaries

459806 weird limbo phase between seasons where most of the designer pieces from spring are sold out and fall collections have yet to hit stores
459807 we really like this art style and were not changing it
459808 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story
459809 hey its the best we could do on such short notice
459810 over engineered by the new degree for men absolute protection
459811 its less about stopping you from sweating but more about saving the world
459812 one day as i was out walking a thought occurred to me perhaps the lord up in heaven is making plans for me maybe hes planning my every step what i will do and say maybe hes planning some glorious things if only i follow his way dear lord i call i give you my all my vision is clear and now i can see i know that the lord up in heaven is making plans for me

459822 mickey actually but dont worry about it happens all the time
459823 tom is such a tough guy so when he feels like hes ready to go hell go
459824 we thought he was the nuts and bolts of the offensive line at kansas city all these years
459825 having him on our football team and playing the way he has is a plus for us
459826 well be down there with nine or 10 coaches who were with gary when he played
459827 keep quiet dont make a sound or theyll hear us and i dont want to be interrupted
459828 doctor what the hell brought that on not that im complaining mind
459829 you rose tyler have a filthy mind and very errant hormones dont broadcast what youre feeling and i wont do things like this
459830 place of the celebration yeah definitely celebration place of the celebration of something
459831 this is the temple of ardraxa place of the celebration of discovery
459832 more or less ancient is an awfully relative term though dont you think
459833 yes i suppose it is im sorry do i know you
459834 there thats better i can see why it was giving you difficulty though its a loan word from a schismatic dialect of jaggaroth not a proto latinate construction like the rest of it there you are
459835 i dont suppose you might happen to know what that was about
459836 nothing terribly important a small misunderstanding over property rights thats all i expect the doctor has it under control
459837 yes they seem to be under the impression that hes their property dont worry im sure hell put them right
459838 if it involves a herd of wild boars packing phaser pistols were already on it listen is there a woman with you a blonde woman

459840 well looks like its just you and me for now im dr daniel jackson by the way
459841 romanadvoratrelundar but you can call me romana most people seem to find it easier for some reason
459842 oh well i can call you romanadvoratrelundar if its more correct or more polite
459843 no romanas fine ive got quite used to it by now
459844 no im not really much of anything these days just a traveler but i did once take a class in the socio linguistic development of class b cultures just for fun really it made for a nice change of pace in a term filled with terribly dry temporal theory
459845 were supposed to be lots of things i stopped bothering about most of them ages ago
459846 so listen romana im wondering if maybe when whatevers actually going on here is all over with you might like to
459847 yeah yeah everybodys fine porky and his friends were trying to sell us into slavery or something but this weirdo here helped us out
459848 listen jack if these people are who i think they are they could be incredibly useful i think we ought to stay and talk to them
459849 yeah one step ahead of you there this doctor guy already agreed to come back through the gate for a debriefing hes got this little door opening gadget that could come in really handy if carter and her egghead buddies can figure out how to copy it
459850 hey thats terrific did you hear that romana youre invited back to oh
459851 i hate those guys oh well easy come easy go you done with those translations yet
459852 while thats kind of sexy that thing with the eyebrow im thinking you might not want to call so much attention to that particular facial feature because what im seeing there is either evidence of non human ancestry or a really anachronistic fashion choice either way id guess its not exactly something youre interested in advertising
459853 am i correct in inferring that you are not a native of this locale
459854 if by locale you mean the 20th century then yeah although maybe i qualify as a naturalized citizen by now
459855 captain jack harkness at your service listen not that i dont enjoy a backrub from a good looking man but do you think maybe you could take your fingers off the nerve bundle in my neck while were talking
459856 you appear to be familiar with a great many things captain harkness
459857 may i inquire how you located me and the nature of your intentions
459858 so i came to investigate its sort of my job a bit out of my usual jurisdiction admittedly but when something that spectacular happens even on the other side of the planet you cant exactly ignore it can you
459859 twenty third huh ive only been there once but it seemed like a fun time lots of optimism lots of really short skirts me im from the fifty first originally which means i probably shouldnt let you look at this
459860 if you were to specify what you think it is
459861 did you build a functioning mnemonic circuit out of of
459862 and here i was starting to think you didnt know how to take things non literally
459863 youre that spock u s s enterprise captain kirk am i right
459864 that vulcans do not possess the quality known to humans as ego i suspect that most entities would find the idea of being remembered twenty eight centuries into their future to be extremely flattering even i will admit to finding the thought somewhat gratifying if true
459865 well if youd said your name was kirk i would have remembered sooner
459866 wow james t kirk i used to be a time agent and kirk was legendary at the agency ive even heard that the whole thing was founded specifically to deal with kirks transgressions back when it was the old department of temporal investigations hey let me ask you is the rumor about you and kirk true you know that you were
459867 do you think i might have a chance because ive seen pictures and
459868 to my knowledge captain kirks temperature is well within normal human range however if you are implying what i believe you to be implying
459869 i am afraid the captains affections at the moment are otherwise engaged
459870 he didnt happen to have two hearts and an amazing capacity for snark
459871 although his penchant for emotional excess might perhaps indicate otherwise i am speaking of our ships surgeon dr leonard mccoy
459872 we were investigating a series of anomalous waves of temporal displacement emanating from an uninhabited planet upon beaming down to the center of the displacement we encountered an entity in appearance a simple stone ring but in fact an ancient artifact of a complexity beyond my capacity to analyze it described itself as the guardian of forever and claimed to offer access to any era of history
459873 you know you really want to be careful with that kind of stuff you go messing around with time travel without knowing what youre doing the effects can get really ugly i once knew a guy who married his own grandmother by mistake you can imagine what an awkward wedding reception that was
459874 at least those of us who were in our right minds at the time unfortunately dr mccoy had recently suffered an overdose of a drug called cordrazine a powerful medication which at high doses can cause aggression and paranoia in this irrational state he beamed down from the ship and vanished through the portal before we could apprehend him immediately afterward we lost contact with our ship it together with history as we had known it had ceased to exist mccoy had evidently performed some action which changed the course of history only we on the planet appeared to be immune to the effect
459875 how a species with such a capacity for exaggeration as humanity can also possess such a significant talent for understatement
459876 were one to proceed from a certain set of axioms as regards the nature of time one could logically conclude that your presence here proves that the difficulty will be resolved your memories of kirk and the enterprise indicate that your timeline is the same as ours therefore our present must be restored in order to give rise to your future
459877 nice piece of thinking but im afraid time travel doesnt work that way when your friend wiped out your history he probably took mine with it no were both in the same boat now orphans from a dead future
459878 sorry to be honest this sort of thing isnt supposed to be possible but its hardly the first time that its happened anyway
459879 ok the way i see it there are two possibilities here
459880 in which case its just pulled off the neat trick of changing history without consequences or else were about to be descended on by the biggest army of reapers the universe has ever seen
459881 well i might survive it but im really not eager to find out
459882 we locate the focal point in time where doctor mccoy effected the precipitating change and prevent him from doing so
459883 was the purpose of this device i was able to ascertain the relevant event although not the precise time nevertheless the odds of success may be in our favor
459884 i am a vulcan it is not in my nature to sound happy however
459885 is the life or more accurately the death of a human being
459886 thats what youve been doing here right calling up historical records
459887 from the guardian recorded both before and during our transit to this time showing the outcome of two distinct timelines
459888 this was the first result i was able to obtain it appears to originate from our universe before the alteration
459889 because the most logical and parsimonious assumption would be that there are only two alternative possibilities at this juncture
459890 youre right the evidence is right there the woman has to die
459891 well what do you want me to say the world is like that sometimes sometimes you have to let shitty things happen to people to keep even shittier things from happening to even more people
459892 if shes the person that newspaper makes her out to be shed probably throw herself under a car willingly if she knew what was at stake
459893 very possibly however i believe that it would be unwise to tell her
459894 unwelcome as that conclusion is it scarcely comes as a surprise i did however have some hope that you might be of assistance in locating doctor mccoy the ethical issue is after all irrelevant if we are unable to intervene at the crucial moment
459895 i really dont think i can help you im sorry in fact im starting to think i really shouldnt be here at all
459896 i had not expected your surveillance would extend over so great a section of the spacetime continuum
459897 that you considered yourself unable or unwilling to interfere if that policy has altered
459898 im not here to deliver any cryptic warnings from the future or anything dont worry its over well as over as these things ever get nah i just came here for a drink figured id find somebody in there who could use one
459899 more than he was when he stepped in there anyway hes had some reasonably good whiskey and a healthy conversation with an understanding not to mention dashingly attractive stranger guy like him thats probably most of what he needs
459900 listen i know vulcans dont drink much and arent supposed to need little things like company but if you wanted to go and get a bowl of plomeek soup somewhere
459901 when he is done benefiting from the company of strangers he will doubtless require the presence of a friend
459902 past experience would suggest that possibility is more likely than might otherwise be expected
459903 que no pararemos hasta ponerlo a disposici n de la justicia

459906 in pakistan terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of shaheed martyr benazir bhutto
459907 while existing on the absolute fringes of our tolerant and peace loving societies terrorists in our region receive institutional nurturing and support
459908 it is this embedded nature of terrorists that make it a much more sinister threat
459909 who killed the innocent people they are bombing and they are shelling from helicopters it is the pakistani army
459910 i dont want america in my country and i dont want our soldiers to work for america and i want the rules and regulations of islamic sharia
459911 our government are following rules and regulations of america and we want to change it
459912 i think from the beginning it was very clear that it would not work
459913 das buch unterscheidet sich sehr von der herk mmlichen wuxia literatur die geschichte dreht sich haupts chlich um schwerter wie man ein schwert anfertigen muss damit es seine spezifischen eigenschaften erh lt wie die beziehung zum schwertk mpfer und dessen disziplin die st rke eines schwertes ver ndern kann welche auswirkungen das schwert auf den k mpfer zu verschiedenen zeiten hat
459914 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
459915 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them
459916 unfortunately that is exactly what comcast was doing with its subscribers internet traffic
459917 this is another attempt by the separatist side to involve georgia in a military conflict
459918 a decision to deploy extra forces is the purview of the security council and president but in any case russia will not allow harm to come to its citizens residing in south ossetia
459919 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006
459920 this figure is roughly 40 percent higher than cdcs former estimate of 40 000 infections per year which was based on limited data and less precise methods
459921 the data really confirm that there is a severe impact of this epidemic among gay and bisexual men in the united states as well as black men and women
459922 it also mirrors what we see about sexually transmitted diseases and changes in risk behaviour among men who have sex with men
459923 the reality is that it is a wake up call for all of us
459924 there are things that you and i can do to stop the disease encourage others to use condoms consistently and correctly abstain from sex
459925 it is important to note that the new estimate does not represent an actual increase in the annual number of new hiv infections
459926 in fact cdcs analysis suggests that the epidemic has been roughly stable since the late 1990s though the number of new hiv infections remains unacceptably high
459927 the analysis shows that new infections peaked in the mid 1980s at approximately 130 000 infections per year and reached a low of about 50 000 in the early 1990s

459930 i mean if my brother was treated like this all of the time i can almost understand why he would want to kill himself
459931 when i said call us if we can do anything for you i mean any thing
459932 we should have brought a rep from mca along to the talks
459933 yes peeling of the onion it was a real tear jerker
459934 i think the club is working hard to get a solution to this matter we will have to see
459935 we knew it would be a complicated matter it was not going to be easy for cristiano ronaldo to come to real madrid
459936 he would be a great player for any coach of course if you ask any coach in the world if they want cristiano ronaldo they would say yes
459937 a lot of teams are interested in buying him but i think he knows he is a very important player in our project

459941 being a celebrity is rubbish if youre doing films just for that youre in the wrong business just go on a reality tv show and wear hot pants to an awards show and youre a celebrity
459942 it is often said that when a south african is a victim of crime they are a victim twice
459943 they are victimised first by violent criminals and then re victimised by the criminal justice system this has to change
459944 they crime victims should be entitled to compensation for medical and other costs they are forced to incur
459945 there needs to be a legally enforceable victims of crime charter that sets out exactly what the rights of victims are and how they will be enforced
459946 the place where the killing happened is very remote and can only be accessed by aircraft so far the police have not even been to the scene to get the facts on the ground
459947 thats not one we will look back on with pride
459948 the game was a mirror of last week in sydney they didnt allow us to build pressure and as a consequence we were unable to get into the game it was one of those days when you try to create pressure and intensity and nothing works
459949 tactically we played very well and learnt a lot from last week
459950 we changed the game plan and we executed it well which was pleasing it was a big lineout game for us
459951 we succeeded in keeping the wallabies off the front foot and were able to perch in their territory
459952 lo tomamos con tranquilidad porque sab amos que no era algo que lo ten amos que resolver nosotros aunque s quer amos que se tomara una decisi n para la tranquilidad de leo y de todo el equipo ten amos que tener todos una soluci n

459954 yeah ill take it home and well throw it away
459955 and we put magazines like that in our trash should we have stuff like that in our trash
459956 hmmmmm good point maybe we should burn it that way no one is ever able to see it again what do you think is that what we should do
459957 yea were only two miles from home lets go burn this stuff
459958 mum and dad were going to retire at the end of the year and go sailing around the world

459962 if you lose enough demerit points often enough to lose your licence then you have a problem
459963 it is not upsetting because lara and i both know it is so false
459964 no doubt we both want to be parents one day i cant wait to be a father but right now lara is 21 i am 27 we both have a lot in front of us and i think that stuff will come all in good time
459965 no doubt since meeting lara my eyes have well and truly opened
459966 i have never been happier we are both in a great place at the moment
459967 having said that there have been some tough times lately and i think that is a sign of strong families that we have stuck together
459968 he was a brilliant man and someone i was very lucky to spend a couple of years with and i know lara thinks of him every day

459973 autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in organs such as the lungs or lymph nodes
459974 it isnt like we havent been here in two or three years we were just here six weeks ago so everybody kind of knows what to expect as far as the track goes
459975 when it clouds up it gains a lot of grip and a lot of speed when the sun breaks out it gets slick and greasy that has a lot to do with the outcome of the race and hopefully it will be just fine
459976 i think we had a pretty good baseline last time here we were pretty happy with our race car so well go back and look at those notes a lot and take what we learned yesterday with the track being a good bit different for us and try to incorporate that all into a best educated guess on what we want
459977 theres always a menu of stuff that we would like to try to improve our car like everyone else
459978 and a lot of these teams have a lot more experience here than us
