3690039 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3690040 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3690041 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3690042 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3690043 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3690044 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3690045 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3690046 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3690047 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3690048 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3690049 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3690050 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3690051 der erste war heute der absolute horrorlauf f r mich wir waren drei tage nicht auf wildwasser da verliert man komplett das gef hl da ist man dann schon ziemlich berrascht wie gro es auf einmal ist ich habe irrsinnig viele kleine fehler drinnen gehabt irrsinnig viele unsicherheiten weil ich auch nicht ansto en wollte es hat sich nicht sch n angef hlt und war wirklich harte arbeit
3690052 ich bin immer sehr hart zu mir und ich will nicht siebente oder achte werden
3690053 vio hat mitbekommen dass es einige 50 sekunden strafen gab da wollte sie eher auf sicherheit fahren aber es war okay
3690054 wo wir sein durften da ist nicht mal eine welle das f hlt sich gleich ganz anders an als h tten sie den schwimmern auf einmal das wasser verboten es war wirklich ganz eigenartig
3690055 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3690056 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3690057 it is not only prayer that gives god glory but work smiting on an anvil sawing a beam whitewashing a wall driving horses sweeping scouring everything gives god glory if being in his grace you do it as your duty to go to communion worthily gives god great glory but a man with a dung fork in his hand a woman with a slop pail give him glory too he is so great that all things give him glory if you mean they should

3690064 for the left it means that the bush administration could have had at its disposal a state controlled media organ with which to manipulate the public to support the war it would also mean that barack obama were he to become the next president would be able to use that same power and money to convince the public that our military should pull out of iraq
3690065 we are thrilled to have broken this record its been an exhilarating and exhausting first few days
3690066 weve experienced every possible type of weather condition including rain icing and strong head winds and through each challenging condition the helicopter has performed exceptionally it took a lot of hard work and last minute coordination to make this record happen and we appreciate everyones efforts
3690067 everyone here at agustawestland would like to congratulate scott and steve on shattering the new york to london speed record in the factory standard agustawestland grand we are tracking the great progress being made flying across russia and look forward to your arrival back in new york and the setting of another world record
3690068 they are doing ok they are making progress which is what we wanted to see
3690069 the right guard adrian jones has made progress the center rudy niswanger had gotten better brian waters has had his best camp it hurts that we lost our left tackle branden albert but herbie taylor has jumped in there and hes doing ok
3690070 now we had some penalties and thats something weve got to clear up
3690071 but thats a pretty good defense its pre season and all but there are talented guys on that defense and overall we did a good job
3690072 hes really shown he can pass protect and he just needs more time there more snaps to get better im pleased with what ive seen from him
3690073 just like jones just like herbie rudy needs to play
3690074 ah lord god it is you who has made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm nothing is too hard for you
3690075 this is a light thing in the sight of the lord

3690086 the first is the availability enthusiasts want to have the update in their hands and microsoft have decided to focus this update on oems
3690087 the reason microsoft have done this in my opinion is that fiji is a significant change to the core of windows media center and due to the massive variety of hardware out in the wild ms thought this was too big of a risk
3690088 the other reason why enthusiasts will be disappointed is the feature set is not what a lot hoped for in the us consumers wanted directv support and for uk users while the update enables dvb s it does not have h 264 so bbc hd will not work
3690089 media center used to get yearly updates but since vista there have been no new features and fiji almost got mythical status in the enthusiasts community which this update only has a small set of the hoped for features
3690090 so in short if your an mce 2005 user whos been sitting on the fence waiting for vista to become stable and to become the hd media center this news can be taken as wait for windows 7 as vista isnt as hd ready as it was implied
3690091 this is a mammoth patch tuesday and we have not seen anything of this scale in a long time
3690092 many of the vulnerabilities addressed by the fixes could be exploited if a windows user simply views a malformed image or visits a malicious web site a favourite attack method among cybercriminals

3690153 halfway through secret invasion do we really need another tie in series to launch well were getting a bunch of them this week whether we need them or not and while i havent read the others yet i can say that secret invasion inhumans is worth your time its a great start and an excellent marvel debut for heroes writer joe pokaski
3690154 i think we went to san diego just happy to be there
3690155 we were on vacation we went there thinking we finished with 10 wins were good were great
3690156 those guys were disappointed to be in that game the expectation level is different and for us to compete with those teams we have to set loftier goals like they do
3690157 when you win games like that guys buy into what coaches are trying to do a little more for a lot of us that have been around we bought into it faster because erickson has two national championship rings on his fingers
3690158 hes a gym rat he spends all kinds of time in the film room he knows football as well as any quarterback ive ever had all the other things like technique and getting the ball off hes getting better at that
3690159 a lot of sacks we had last year were on play action pass
3690160 we didnt protect well up front we didnt protect well behind him we didnt get it off as quick as we should have to us its a temporary problem we hope will be solved
3690161 i still remember losses from when i was 5 years old
3690162 i played in a few championships in pee wee football and in high school football and some we won and some we lost i guess the ones you lose are the ones you take with you you enjoy the ones you win but you wish you could win them all
3690163 we have a lot of athletes on the field guys that can make plays
3690164 im hoping we do pass more and i can get the ball in the hands of those athletes so they can make plays we still have a great athlete in noel and he has to get his touches but id like to spread the wealth
3690165 he is really doing a nice job of putting the ball where it needs to be
3690166 and i will be until i cant play that position
3690167 were definitely working hard and were hungry if we continue to do that who knows where well end up
3690168 its about an autistic boy named jason who is very devoted to his high school basketball team by helping players in practice sessions and distributing water because of jasons dedication and enthusiasm the basketball coach allowed him to suit up for a game so he can feel what its like to wear a jersey but to everyones surprise the coach actually let jason play what happened next was truly remarkable

3690178 in a sense they may see it as economically viable for them to skirt the law and wait to see if they get sued because the exposure is not that huge if they dont get sued
3690179 if they can settle a complaint for less than 100 percent of what they owe people for overtime theyve gotten away with a good deal
3690180 the advantage to a company of classifying somebody as exempt is that the company can make the employee work as much as it wants and the employees only remedy is to ask for more money quit or sue for back wages
3690181 it hinges on whether the employee exercises independent judgment and discretion with respect to matters of significance for the company
3690182 if you dont exercise independent judgment if you perform rote repetitive tasks in accordance with guidelines protocols checklists or established procedures youre not likely to be exempt under the administrative exemption because youre not exercising discretion youre just following the rules
3690183 companies like to give fancy titles to employees because its a costless way for them to make their employees feel valued and it has a corollary benefit of making employees sound like they fit an exemption if the employer has an eye to getting sued
3690184 weve found in these cases that there are established protocols and pathways and instructions and guidelines and ways of doing things that they have to follow time and time again
3690185 you get an alert from a third party software vendor and you know what the steps are to install those updates because you did it last week theres a right way to do it and not a lot of choice in the matter
3690186 or if theres an error showing up on the monitoring software with respect to a router you know you have to check 11 different aspects of the router and when you find the thing that is wrong with the router you fix it and theres only one fix and theres not much choice in the matter

3690206 i believe we need to create a special committee in the us senate to exercise oversight over contracting abuses related to reconstruction and the wars in iraq and afghanistan
3690207 it is interesting being stretched between two cities but i knew it was time to get involved and i am excited about the future
3690208 i think the photography show gives people who do not paint sculpt or draw an opportunity to show off what they can do some people have taken lessons and learned how to take pictures and some just have a natural talent to capture beauty
3690209 typically i like to have a general idea of what i am going to shoot i do both film and digital but the beauty of digital is i might take 1 000 pictures and have one good one it takes less planning
3690210 i dont use photoshop or anything to change the picture it is all about camera settings lighting and what can be done before the picture is taken to make it the best possible not after
3690211 the board has come to the realization that the core members are aging and that if they dont do something to reach out to younger people the group is going to peter out

3690213 i would like kaa to have a stronger art presence in the community
3690214 i would like to get to the place where we are as large as the salem art association and we are having a definite impact on the community
3690215 we are struggling right now we need to be able to pay for classes and our rent and utilities supplies and advertising
3690216 because of our location we are unable to have wine tasting or alcohol at our events
3690217 but by taking our art into the community we could develop some good partnerships and community support
3690218 i think the only reason we do not have more business support is because we havent asked and they dont know what they can do
3690219 the hungarian player has hold of us and we get excluded its total rubbish as far as i am concerned

3690261 is it possible that this time the october surprise was tried in august and that the garbage issue of brave little georgia struggling for its survival from the grasp of the russian bear was stoked to influence the u s presidential election
3690262 since cheney has exactly the same view about the use of american military power as putin does about russian power im not sure what grounds he has to complain maybe we should start complaining when as many georgians have perished as iraqis and when putin throws thousands of innocent georgians into torture chambers
3690263 if bill clinton were still president and the republicans still controlled congress i think theyd skip the impeachment hearings and proceed directly to a bill of attainder
3690264 nato the us and europe broke their word they expanded nato further and further into what russia considers its buffer states states which cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of potential enemies russian geopolitics has been obsessed with controlling those states for centuries along with getting a warm water port this is not a short term minor issue it is at the heart of what russia believes it needs to be defensible lots and lots of space next us and western policy towards russia in the 90s was based around a shock therapy transition to a free market the result of that was an actual decline in the russian population us neo liberal economics applied to russia killed millions of people no exaggeration it wasnt the only cause but when youve promised the sky and the free marketers did and the result is hell on earth well people remember that
3690265 washingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia georgia president mikhail saakashvili would never dream of launching a massive military attack unless he got explicit orders from his bosses at 1600 pennsylvania ave after all saakashvili owes his entire political career to american power brokers and us intelligence agencies if he disobeyed them hed be gone in a fortnight besides an operation like this takes months of planning and logistical support especially if its perfectly timed to coincide with the beginning of the olympic games another petty neocon touch that means pentagon planners must have been working hand in hand with georgian generals for months in advance nothing was left to chance putin has played his cards very wisely which makes it look like the fighting in south ossetia may be washingtons way of trying to win through military force what they could not achieve via the free market

3690279 discarding fish not only means a massive waste of food and potential income it also leads to unrecorded catches resulting in a poorer scientific basis for our management decisions
3690280 i want a requirement that all fish caught in norwegian waters also by foreign vessels must be taken to port regardless of which final port is used we will introduce new requirements as a condition for obtaining licenses to fish that vessels cannot discard valuable fish caught here
3690281 this must stop now the eu community cannot be taken seriously if it allows this kind of behaviour this is certainly not how to manage the worlds resources
3690282 it is a disgrace this practice is depleting populations that are already overfished and it is happening everywhere
3690283 all of these fish are perfectly marketable and have been legally caught but if you are a fisherman it makes more economic sense to take boat to market with the most saleable fish so you discard the lowest value stuff
3690284 it is out of contact we very rarely fish in norwegian waters thats the first time in years
3690285 the reason there are discards is the ridiculously low quotas fishermen cannot make a living with them they are at a ridiculous level
3690286 throwing dead fish back into the sea is a waste that nobody wants to see but there is no easy answer the uk is keen to ensure more effective and sustainable fisheries by reducing by catch and discards and the government is working closely with fishermen to achieve that

3690320 thats where nursing staff took these babies and left them to die
3690321 christ hospital and we now know other hospitals and clinics around the country are involved in an abortion procedure called induced labor abortion
3690322 my experience was that they the babies survive as short as a few minutes to once almost as long as an eight hour shift
3690323 to be clear these were living babies who were left out to die and they were issued both birth and death certificates according to illinois state law
3690324 when she told me what she was doing i couldnt bear the thought of this suffering child dying alone
3690325 and so i cradled and rocked him for the forty five minutes that he lived
3690326 was unmoved and actually opposed the born alive infant protection act
3690327 thought that infanticide was acceptable and voted to protect it some people said that barack obama was uninformed or may not have fully understood the implications of this bill but he voted against it three times thats calculated
3690328 as chairman of the health and human services committee in 2003 he stopped the identical wording from being introduced
3690329 barack obama can play word games but at the end of the day his opposition was responsible for living babies being left out to die and that is indefensible

3690336 the illuminati the real force behind all communist and fascist movements whether youre aware of it or not theyre also already in control of the united states government
3690337 i thought everybody in your crowd was a right winger
3690338 and i told you spacial metaphors are inadequate in discussing politics today
3690339 well you sound like a gang of right wingers up until the last minute all ive heard from you and your people was that the illuminati were commies or were behind the commies now you say theyre behind fascism and behind the current government in washington too
3690340 we came on like right wing paranoids at first to see how youd react it was a test
3690341 you passed you didnt believe us that was obvious but you kept your eyes and ears open and were willing to listen if you were a right winger we would have done our pro communist rap the idea is to find out if a new man or woman will listen really listen or just shut their minds at the first really shocking idea
3690342 im listening but not uncritically for instance if the illuminati control america already whats the purpose of the assassinations
3690343 their grip on washington is still pretty precarious theyve been able to socialize the economy but if they showed their hand now and went totalitarian all the way there would be a revolution middle readers would rise up with right wingers and left libertarians and the illuminati arent powerful enough to withstand that kind of massive revolution but they can rule by fraud and by fraud eventually acquire access to the tools they need to finish the job of killing off the constitution
3690344 more stringent security measures universal electronic surveillance no knock laws stop and frisk laws government inspection of first class mail automatic fingerprinting photographing blood tests and urinalysis of any person arrested before he is charged with a crime a law making it unlawful to resist even unlawful arrest laws establishing detention camps for potential subversives gun control laws restrictions on travel the assassinations you see establish the need for such laws in the public mind instead of realizing that there is a conspiracy conducted by a handful of men the people reason or are manipulated into reasoning that the entire populace must have its freedom restricted in order to protect the leaders the people agree that they themselves cant be trusted targets for assassination will be mavericks of left or right who are either not part of the illuminati conspiracy or have been marked as unreliable the kennedy brothers and martin luther king for example were capable of mobilizing a somewhat libertarian left right black white populist movement but the assassinations that have occurred so far are nothing compared to what will take place the next wave will be carried out by the mafia who will be paid in illuminati gold
3690345 the puppets in the kremlin have no idea that they and the puppets in the white house are working for the same people the illuminati control all sorts of organizations and national governments without any of them being aware that others are also controlled each group thinks it is competing with the others while actually each is playing its part in the illuminati plan even the morituri the six person affinity groups which splintered from the sds weathermen because the weathermen seemed too cautious are under the control of the illuminati they think theyre working to bring down the government but actually they are strengthening its hand the black panthers are also infiltrated everything is infiltrated at present rate within the next few years the illuminati will have the american people under tighter surveillance than hitler had the germans and the beauty of it is the majority of the americans will have been so frightened by illuminati backed terrorist incidents that they will beg to be controlled as a masochist begs for the whip
3690346 so the illuminati are conspiring to tyrannize the world is that it do you trace them back to the first international
3690347 well it would be logical enough that someone around that time would think of that
3690348 and who more likely than a mason who was an unfrocked jesuit
3690349 well the illuminati after staying above ground long enough to recruit a hard core membership from masons and freethinkers and to establish international contacts allowed it to seem that the bavarian government had suppressed them subsequently the illuminati launched their first experimental revolution in france here they suckered the middle class whose true interests lay in laissez faire free enterprise to follow the weishaupt slogan of liberty equality fraternity the catch of course is that where equality and fraternity rule there is no liberty after the career of napoleon whose rise and fall was purely the result of illuminati manipulations they started planting the seeds of european socialism leading to the revolutions of eighteen forty eight to marxism finally to the seizure of russia one sixth of the earths land mass of course they had to engineer a world war to make the russian revolution possible but by nineteen seventeen they had become quite good at that world war two was an even more clever job and resulted in more gains for them
3690350 is why orthodox marxism leninism in spite of all its ideals always turns out to be not worth a shit why its always betrayed the people wherever it established itself and it explains why theres such an inevitable quality about americas drift toward totalitarianism
3690351 america is the target now theyve got most of europe and asia once they get america they can come out into the open the world will then be much as orwell predicted in nineteen eighty four they bumped him off after it was published you know the book hit a little too close to home he was obviously on to them the references to inner and outer parties with different teachings obriens speech about power being an end in itself and they got him orwell you see ran across them in spain where they were functioning quite openly at one point during the civil war but artists also arrive at truth through their imaginations if they let themselves wander freely theyre more likely to arrive at the truth than more scientific minded people
3690352 youve just tied two hundred years of world history up in a theory that would make me feel i should have myself committed if i accepted it
3690353 but im drawn to it i admit partly intuitively i feel you are a person who is essentially sane and not paranoid partly because the orthodox version of history that i was taught in school never made sense to me and i know how people can twist history to suit their beliefs and therefore i assume that the history ive learned is twisted partly because of the very wildness of the idea if i learned one thing in the last few years its that the crazier an idea is the more likely it is to be true still and all given all those reasons for believing you i would like some further sign

3690369 it is in part a service to our students who are finding their levels of disposable income being stretched further year on year the other benefit is that the public will be able to purchase items which are attractively priced

3690388 audacity of arrogance applies to both of our u s senators but for opposite reasons john hopkins cites barack obamas inexperience as justification for that apt description in sen richard durbins case he feels so entrenched in his position senate majority whip that he is untouchable consider the following examples of his arrogant behavior that have been unsupportive and unresponsive to the needs of the country and of the state of illinois the medical community in the state of illinois has been decimated by the abuse of medical malpractice litigation especially with the loss of at least 170 physicians from madison and st clair counties and yet durbin led the attack against federal medical malpractice reform on the floor of the u s senate more than 4 000 young men and women have bravely sacrificed their lives and tens of thousands have been mutilated in the war on terror in iraq and afghanistan and yet durbin in reference to an egregious but isolated act of inhumane treatment of prisoners of war compared our military heroes in general to the nazis of the stalags the guards of the gulag archipelago and the monster pol pot

3690397 we cannot find anyone how they were evacuated and what happened there is a mystery to us
3690398 georgian forces have begun their pullback toward tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3690399 russian occupying forces are continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
3690400 if saakashvili had not been armed up to the teeth he would never have made such a decision
3690401 georgia should not have intervened in south ossetian capital tskhinvali in such an ill prepared manner this was a grave mistake
3690402 the situation is extremely tense and very complicated what happens next is uncertain i hope that the talks of president saakashvili with his western partners will lead to an end to the conflict

3690406 canadian chinese relations used to be very good and business was business but all of the sudden to the chineses surprise the new canadian leader became very political and particularly politically biased against china
3690407 theyre watching a lot more for china this is a large thing
3690408 its the first time china is hosting the olympics and we all know that western countries have some bias against our regime so it is a test a political test which people will remember for quite some time
3690409 chinese people see it as a symbol of how it is coming to the centre of the world stage of great powers so it means it should get enough respect from the world
3690410 and respect means that top leaders of foreign countries will participate in this opening ceremony
3690411 the two countries have shared good relations and good memories for a long time
3690412 the canadian government has always shown efforts to have good relations and ties with china until this current administration
3690413 but i didnt notice the prime minister of canada wasnt there maybe because i dont like the political side of the olympics
3690414 if it was a famous player who didnt come that matters but i think if leaders from other countries dont come its not a big deal
3690415 knows it is not because of a matter of scheduling
3690416 they have made some connection with his human rights criticisms and his absence
3690417 if the canadian prime minister is not coming because of human rights i would like to see how canadas government could feed 1 3 billion the chinese government has done a lot for us and that is human rights
3690418 they directly order china to do this to do that in a specific way sometimes it will just have an opposite effect
3690419 in chinese culture we first focus on so called face
3690420 sometimes i can feel unsatisfied with you and i dont agree with what you do but when i want to keep a basic relationship or friendship with you i will give you face and respect you on those important ceremonies i will participate in it to show that though we have a disagreement we are still friends
3690421 it would be very very nice to see the prime minister come to china
3690422 a lot of chinese people had been waiting for this moment
3690423 fluericiu criteriul tau e cat se poate de valid daca vorbim doar de administratori de firma si de politisti sau asa ceva atunci nu e mare coruptie
3690424 there is a long and complicated road ahead of us with a lot of challenges that we shouldnt underestimate
3690425 we want to guard against people thinking that in 2011 kandahar will be a shining gleaming province it wont be we are trying to undo 30 years of war and underdevelopment it takes generations
3690426 what russia is doing in georgia is open unhidden aggression and a challenge to the whole world if the whole world does not stop russia today then russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital
3690427 the sat in many ways were generic military planners provided at a time when afghan ministries needed general strategic planning advice
3690428 what were looking at now is focusing on technical assistance thats really based on the specific needs of key afghan ministries
3690429 its more focused more needs driven by the afghans and more focused on helping them implement rather than just organize
3690430 the sat was a transitional organization basically a creature of its time
3690431 at the particular time sat was formed there were only four canada based staff at the embassy in kabul today we have more than 30
3690432 this is a natural transition and reflects that we are balancing away from a largely military to more of a civilian mission
3690433 mr john manley recommended that the sat a be an initiative that extends beyond the department of defence
3690434 as long as we can rely on governance support for our offices where its needed we appreciate it and we are thankful
3690435 we as recipients see this as a continuation through different means and at the end of the day the functions they perform will be the same
3690436 there is no doubt they brought certain expertise knowledge and skills
3690437 their assistance in our ministries and agencies has been appreciated and so we thank them for what they did for us
3690438 i think they have the strategy of giving an image of less military domination and a more civilian image of the afghan mission
3690439 join any nato consensus to admit the republic of georgia to natos membership action plan
3690440 canadas steadfast support for natos open door is also reflected in our strong support for the membership aspirations of ukraine and georgia
3690441 at bucharest our leaders said that these countries will become members of nato
3690442 we must make these words a reality the alliance will assess progress towards meeting the standards for entry in the membership action plan process in december 2008 and canada looks forward to a positive result
3690443 so far i dont know any negative attitudes from canadian side
3690444 extends the nato family into those regions and i think its all very important to ultimately better euro atlantic security
3690445 its up to canadians and to georgians theyre sovereign countries and they can make up their minds whether to be a part of any alliance or not
3690446 we have a pakistan strategy but were working on updating our pakistan strategy
3690447 the situation is quite dynamic thats why we have to continually look at our strategy and update it
3690448 now this has become clear and we have told the government of pakistan that the killings of people in afghanistan the destruction of bridges in afghanistan are carried out by pakistans intelligence and pakistans military departments
3690449 president karzai met with prime minister gilani at the south asian regional cooperation summit in sri lanka last week
3690450 i understand that as a result of that they will be resuming some of their dialogue so im hopeful that will include our initiative
3690451 going to have to be stability and security on pakistans side
3690452 it is very hard to imagine a stable future for afghanistan
3690453 frankly i just dont think weve devoted the time or resources
3690454 our high commission in islamabad is badly understaffed and the general approach has been one of not paying attention
3690455 the isi has functioned as a virtual state within a state for decades
3690456 there has to be a clear public response from the government of pakistan as to how this could be happening and to say its a few rogue agents is entirely insufficient
3690457 canada clearly has to be working with friends and allies like the un to hold the government of pakistan accountable for the activities underway in territories under its control
3690458 were waking up rather late in the game to understanding the significance of pakistans role
3690459 unless you deal with pakistan first anything you do in afghanistan will be meaningless because you havent dealt with the most important actor in the conflict
3690460 the pakistan component as a result of recent revelations is of critical nature
3690461 we welcome at least a review at the very least of such policies and hopefully more co ordination and a better focus on this matter
3690462 what a musical revue respecting specialty how faithful intake justification how infinitely continuous up to date
3690463 from my experience you always have to be very positive about the next year because anything can happen we know that the 2006 season wasnt as good as we expected but we think we have the potential to produce a good car and we know that we can do at least as well as we did in 2005 all we have to do is work hard at what we are doing and hope the engineers have got it right on the car ive heard that theyve made a good step in the wind tunnel but its too early to make any prediction
3690464 sure that was one of the weakest points last year we lost several good opportunities because of reliability so it was really a shame it was a disappointing season for all of us drivers and team because we expected to have a better car but it was only competitive sometimes it was actually a very difficult season however i think we got a lot of good experience which will help us for the future
3690465 its true that the car made really good progress by the end of the season but you always struggle to understand if it was due to the car or if it was due to the tyres this year we will have a better idea
3690466 when you start working with a team and straight away you have good results like i did in 2005 you are very optimistic for the future especially when you look at the resources of the team the capability and the potential last season didnt show the true potential of the team so from my point of view i needed a long term contract in order to have the continuity inside the team i strongly believe that i can win races with toyota its not something thats going to happen easily but i believe toyota has the potential to do great things and eventually win the championship
3690467 it shows that the team trusts the driver and they believe in my potential especially after all the good results in 2005 when the car was good and reliable as i say one season doesnt tell you everything we have continuity in the driver line up on the engineers side and what we have to do now is build up a team to make our car quicker
3690468 i expected to have a bit of an advantage over the other teams but the tyres we used in winter testing are new and the tyres we used last season have nothing to do with them but for sure the experience we gained last year will be helpful we have a good relationship with bridgestone and they know us they know our car and they can give us a direction to help us work better with these tyres
3690469 no i dont think so i think the team who makes the better car and can exploit the tyres will have a big advantage even if the new tyres are easy to handle and easy to understand they can clearly show you the problems of the car and in this case a small problem can become a big problem for performance we can probably see some close races and some others where the gap will be bigger
3690470 whoever drives for ferrari next season will have a big advantage i dont think michael schumacher or ross brawn leaving will change things that much
3690471 ive never regretted leaving renault it wasnt the place for me my win at monaco in 2004 instead of strengthening the relationship actually fractured it
3690472 it was a very busy season and what we learned was that improving performance is not sufficient we learned that reliability is essential the pattern of the season was totally different compared to 2005 we started that season in good shape in terms of performance and then by the end of the season it was getting a little harder in 2006 we started the season in the midfield and by the end we were close to the top in terms of performance but this progress of performance through the season was perhaps not visible thats what we have to accept the main reason for that was we were not able to finish as many of the races as we wanted to because of various reliability issues
3690473 we did not find a global root cause that would have been too easy as usual when issues are not caused by basic mistakes its a combination of factors in terms of packaging for example we pushed harder to develop performance and the packaging of the car was tighter and tighter it has favoured the occurrence of some of our reliability issues in other cases we paid for innovative concepts which by nature cannot be immediately under total control all these things together mean that we took more risks than the year before in terms of reliability
3690474 the dominant factors dont really change from year to year the physics stay the same we are still optimising the two major performance factors aerodynamics and tyres with the tyres of course some parameters have changed obviously we wont develop the tyres any more but it does not mean that the tyre will not be controlling the development of the car simply because whatever the characteristics of the tyre it will still be about getting the best from them and of course continuous aerodynamic development is the other major performance factor that weve taken into account for the tf107
3690475 we have several major changes in terms of packaging the engine has moved forward the gearbox has moved forward and the front of the monocoque is higher most of these changes i would say are driven by the aero development of the car the car allows us to introduce new suspension systems as well which concept will be developed in several steps
3690476 the tf107 is a total change we have almost no parts which will fit from the tf106 or tf106b the fact that we had a b car for monaco did not impact at all the ambition of the development of the tf107 not at all despite the fact that we were busy with the tf106b we started the concept of the tf107 in january 2006 its true that we went into a very different scheduling of our evolution last year but it was really driven by a major decision the crossover point was to bring the tf105b in the middle of 2005 thats what created the cycle 105b 106 106b
3690477 the testing conditions for the front and rear crash have changed its not a major thing just something which our design group had to take into account but these evolutions are almost invisible except that the basic shape of the rear crash area is imposed but its imposed on all the teams so all teams will have lost a little bit of performance with that
3690478 we have a roll out version we will have a completely new aero package for the first race and then a second major upgrade coming quite early in the season just after the flyaway races then we will of course develop race specific packages high downforce low to mid downforce and the monza package apart from these major milestones the norm will be to bring upgrades to every single race
3690479 i am optimistic for this season one factor in toyotas favour is that we are the only team to be remaining constant in all aspects from drivers to tyre supplier that should work in our favour as it gives us stability also the team has one more year of experience under its belt now so we should be stronger we have the potential to succeed in the team and i hope we can show that this season i cant wait for it to start
3690480 we went into a lot of new areas and we were very happy with a lot of the work we did in terms of speed unfortunately we had reliability problems but in most of the races in the latter part of the season we were only a couple of tenths away from the top teams renault and ferrari on average over each lap so the trend is clearly right
3690481 a lot of things have been changed on the car especially in the way it has been developed i am positive about how they were managed we kept calm and sorted out the issues we had last year the signs are good and we seem to be heading in the right direction engine wise we are pretty much there and the reliability issues we had last year are being worked on we will have some mechanical changes an upgrade in the gearbox and things like that so we will get a car more optimised and i am sure aero wise we have gained a lot those are the key factors
3690482 i am quite happy i must say i appreciate it because tyre manufacturers are not forced to take as much risk by developing the tyres all season we have far safer tyres even if we go a second slower the show will still be great it is the same situation for all teams so it takes away a big question mark about performance
3690483 these tyres have a completely different construction to what we were using in 2006 but we know the bridgestone people a bit more and the working relationship is really close so from that point of view it helps to have been co operating for one year already i think with only a couple of tyre compounds available each weekend there is not a lot bridgestone can do to help teams besides gaining experience with pressures and cambers
3690484 i think it is always a difficult decision to make as a manufacturer like toyota always wants to build the best engine and not have development restricted but if you look at f1 as a whole it is not a bad idea because the racing is not going to be better if an engine has more horsepower or more revs the spectators will not see those kind of things long term i think it is the right decision as it keeps speeds under control and that makes it safer for drivers
3690485 it was definitely a big challenge even though the fia tried to keep as much as possible of the internal single cylinder details of the v10 basically it was a completely new engine this is why we at toyota had an engine on the dyno quite early and also on the track we had an engine on the dyno on 21 march and the first engine on the track was late july nevertheless during the year we suffered some issues in terms of how the engine worked with the rest of the car this meant that lessons were learned by the whole team and proved how big a big challenge the change to v8s was
3690486 if you see the engine on its own i would say we are happy in terms of performance but if i look at the reliability we suffered as a team as a package then of course were not happy
3690487 we found that for some reason a lot of minor details that had lost importance during the v10 era became important again in terms of stopping the car small things like a shaft driving a pump or the radiator fixings no one had to worry about details like these in the last two or three years of the v10 but they experienced a different loading condition on a v8 this was basically the fee to pay in the first year of the v8s and hopefully this year we wont experience anything like it
3690488 first of all the uncertainties influenced us a lot for a long time it was not clear what was planned which for us meant keeping a lot of parallel projects alive to try to cover everything that was the first issue secondly there was the idea of introducing a rev limiter but even if this was discussed before no one thought it would go to 19 000rpm we planned to introduce an engine during last season that was designed to rev much higher it was an engine to finish the season with and then properly introduce for 2007 once it was clear that we had to homologate an engine in 2006 for 2007 we had to stop so it was a big waste of resources and time
3690489 after nurburgring we started to think about our development based on 2007 and definitely in the last four or five races from monza on all our evolutions were strictly constrained by thinking about 2007 i think it was the same for other teams as well
3690490 we think its a good base but as a racing team we were not happy about development restrictions because we were thinking of a lot of development we wanted to carry out the fia has limited the possibility of re tuning which means that a lot of planned development that should have gone on the engine had to be stopped as an engineer this is something that i dont like
3690491 from the engine point of view we are doubling the chance to tune reliability and so on they should be a good benchmark so i can collect double the data and from an engine point of view thats important for us i think also our chassis colleagues can learn a little bit and will be better able to judge the positive aspects of our car both williams and toyota will have a benchmark
3690492 it was a difficult qualifying session we both did a reasonably good job and i think we are in good shape for the race we will keep working hard but having two cars in the top 10 is not too bad the first session went well and we had no trouble getting through as you could see i had a spin on my last flying lap in q2 at the chicane but luckily it did not matter and we got into the top 10 again the red flag in q3 didnt really affect me it is part of our job when i saw lewis get out of the car i could just forget it straight away obviously there is quite a lot of work to do to fight the cars ahead of us but from where we are on the grid we have a good chance of scoring points again so as usual i will push hard and try to get the best result possible it should be dry tomorrow but we are at the n rburgring so anything can happen
3690493 the session went quite well for me today and getting into the top 10 is positive we would have liked to have finished a bit higher but eighth and ninth is still okay we knew it was going to be difficult to get both cars in the top 10 but the car feels quite good and i am reasonably happy with todays performance it felt like we had a decent balance throughout the session and we had no problems with the car so that was good i am happy to be on the clean side of the grid for the start tomorrow hopefully we can make a strong start because there are cars in front of us which i think we can catch we will see how it goes but i am hopeful the weekend has gone well for us so far and now we will hopefully score some points
3690494 our fundamental challenge this year is to get the first victory
3690495 we announced that a year ago but we failed to succeed in 2006
3690496 im very very positive about this and i personally think we should attack from round one therefore its very important to conduct some productive testing during the winter to fully understand the car and the tyres
3690497 tomita san john and myself are like three arrows in the japanese saying one arrow breaks easily two is harder to break and with three arrows you cannot break them
3690498 of course i am excited by the task whenever i get an assignment no matter how hard the challenge is i am happy that is my attitude
3690499 the most important target to aim for this season is the first victory for toyota in formula 1
3690500 we want to be on the top step of the podium we have improved in all areas aerodynamics suspension and gear change
3690501 our ambition has always been to win that to me is why we are here and why we are racing
3690502 i think we built a fairly good platform in 2005 and last year we didnt move forward sufficiently from that platform i think in terms of speed we had the third quickest package on the grid
3690503 looking at race pace and qualifying pace we were closing the gap on renault towards the end of the season but ferrari was still in front although the results didnt show it i think we are now capable of running with the top teams in terms of speed
3690504 and we have resolved issues like the launch system which we fixed at the end of last season and which cost us dearly were improving the car flat out all the time so i think we have the potential to win this year and im disappointed that we didnt deliver it in 2006
3690505 its pretty extensively changed in terms of basic lay out
3690506 when we went from the v10 to v8 the back of the engine effectively stayed in the same place and the chassis and fuel tank filled the space where the front two cylinders of the v10 were
3690507 aerodynamics is the big focus and a lot of the chassis layout has been designed to give better aero opportunity the whole monocoque concept has been modified in terms of height and how it sits before it was quite a low car now its higher we have improved the suspension and we have some interesting developments in the pipeline that we hope will give us performance
3690508 in the beginning it we had some problems i would compare it to the weather in the winter testing and at the beginning of the season it was cloudy but in the middle of the year the clouds began to disappear and towards the end it was perfectly sunny
3690509 it was down and up through the year but it was a very good learning year in 2006 so if i talk about 2007 and going to single tyre supplier we have learned a lot about tyre treatment particularly about temperature suspension geometry and downforce
3690510 we evaluated a number of potential fingerprint solutions for this project and found that atrua delivered the superior combination of features and performance for mobile phones
3690511 because of the atrua sensors small size we were able to fit it conveniently on the edge of the p960

3690527 the iphone has the potential of being the next truly personal computing platform
3690528 with os x and the new applications developer kit you have the makings of a device that could change the face of portable computing
3690529 the iphone is the perfect platform for advancing mobile learning and developing education and reference guides for anytime anywhere use
3690530 beyond the simple fact that you can easily carry this great content around in your pocket you can also use the iphone to extend learning in ways that are impossible in print format some of our products have added audio or video quiz features search functionality links to web content interactive maps and more it feels like were discovering and developing new features on an almost daily basis
3690531 when the iphone software development kit was released somebody here suggested that we should see what we could do with it thinking maybe wed be able to build something that could display a few medical images on the iphone
3690532 i will go to lodge a complaint with the international community not to recognize the election
3690533 we will continue being shoulder to shoulder with the srp to protest against the election results we will also join with srp to protest in europe and at the un
3690534 the election process in cambodia was conducted in line with the election law of cambodia any complaint or unacceptable problem must be addressed under cambodian law
3690535 the srp and hrp should give time to the nec and the constitutional council to settle any unsatisfactory problems before protesting to the international community
3690536 furthermore representatives of the un european union and the international community also observed the election and assessed that the election in cambodia was better than before

3690707 an arabian bedouin man entered the masjid on friday while the prophet was delivering the speech he said o messenger of allah our possessions are destroyed our children are hungry ask allah for us he the prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam raised his hands in supplication to allah all of a sudden mountain like clouds were formed he did not descend from his minbar the podium until i saw rain falling through his beard on the second friday this arabian man or someone else stood up and said o messenger of allah sallallahu alaihi wa sallam buildings have collapsed and possessions are flooded ask allah for us he the prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam raised his hands and said o my lord around us and not on us wherever he pointed to an area of the sky they the clouds dispersed
3690708 and i bring the dead to life by allahs leave
3690709 and when you o jesus brought forth the dead by my permission
3690710 the hour has drawn near and the moon has been cleft asunder
3690711 such is allah your lord his is the kingdom and those whom you invoke or call upon instead of him own not even a qitmir the membrane over the date stone
3690712 o chiefs i know not that you have a god other than me
3690713 and they belied them our signs wrongfully and arrogantly though their own selves were convinced thereof
3690714 verily you know that these signs have been sent down by none but the lord of the heavens and the earth as clear evidences of his oneness and might and i think you are indeed o pharaoh doomed to destruction
3690715 who is the lord of the seven heavens and the lord of the great throne
3690716 in whose hands is the sovereignty of everything and he protects all while against whom there is no protector if you know
3690717 how then are you deceived and turn away from the truth
3690718 and if you ask them who created them they will surely say
3690719 and your lord is one lord there is none who has the right to be worshipped but he the most beneficent the most merciful
3690720 allah bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped but he and the angels and those having knowledge also give this witness he is always maintaining his creation in justice none has the right to be worshipped but he the all mighty the all wise
3690721 that is because allah is the truth the only true god and what they the disbelievers invoke besides him it is falsehood and verily allah is the most high the most great
3690722 they are but names which you have named you and your fathers for which allah has sent down no authority
3690723 are many different lords gods better or allah the one the irresistible you do not worship beside him but only names which you have forged you and your fathers for which allah has sent down no authority
3690724 yet they have taken besides him other gods that created nothing but are themselves created and possess neither hurt nor benefit for themselves and possess no power
3690725 say o muhammad call upon those whom you asset to be associate gods besides allah they possess not even the weight of an atom either in the heavens or on the earth nor they have any share in either nor is there for him any supporter from among them
3690726 do they attribute as partners to allah those who created nothing but they themselves are created no help can they give them nor can they help themselves
3690727 o mankind worship your lord allah who created you and those who were before you so that you may become among the pious who has made the earth a resting place for you and the sky as a canopy and sent down rain from the sky and brought forth therewith fruits as a provision for you then do not set up rivals unto allah in worship while you know that he alone has the right to be worshipped
3690728 and if you ask them who created them they will surely say
3690729 who provides for you from the sky and from the earth or who owns hearing and sight and who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead form the living and who disposes the affairs
3690730 and all the most beautiful names belong to allah so call on him by them and leave the company of those who deny his names they will be requited for what they used to do
3690731 his is the highest description in the heavens and in the earth and he is the all mighty the all wise
3690732 there is nothing like unto hint and he is the all hearer the all seer

3690737 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3690738 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3690739 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3690740 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3690742 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3690743 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3690744 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3690745 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3690746 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3690759 i think the highlight of the day for me was greenie talking about sexy shad
3690760 we wanted to name it something catchy and transcendent and when a guy whos not an avid angler wants to talk about it then that strategy worked
3690761 it was neat to see how many people came to check it out

3690764 hes healthy now after the surgery its just he needs to build up his arm strength i dont know if theres enough time to do it but we also figure that we dont have anything to lose to try hes a guy that weve always liked

3690768 he has shown a lot of improvement the last few times and people feel hes ready to pitch there toledo

3690770 the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and is safe
3690771 i will both lay me down in peace and sleep for thou lord only makest me dwell in safety

3690777 when i had a headset on and was doing the games watching coaches run their teams it made me realize how much i loved coaching i missed the people the competition all the good and the bad that goes along with college basketball i needed more than what i had
3690778 there really wasnt any real substance to those talks to be honest just two guys having a cup of coffee it wasnt going to happen two years ago simply because it wasnt the right time this time we could talk we could be serious about it
3690779 i read an article about the other day that said that the events in pittsburgh a feb 4 2004 incident in which several players were accused of sexual assault led to my being fired i wasnt even coaching the team at the time very few stories that have been written are anywhere near the truth im convinced that the more thats written about it the less factual it will be
3690780 to go through something like that for so long you learn that there really arent that many people in the world that you can call friend
3690781 the most important friend anyone has is god and ive not only had the opportunity to be reborn spiritually ive been reborn professionally there really arent a lot of people that can really say that
3690782 we thought we were moving down here to get away from the rat race so to speak maybe id retire and do a little tv
3690783 i didnt realize at the time that the good lord was preparing me for the job at fau he granted me gifts and he wants me to use them
3690784 you have to expect greatness and maintain a certain attitude and you have to surround yourself with talent and resources the administration here at western is very aggressive in its pursuit of excellence they want us to have the resources to make this a consistent top 25 program they want us to run our operations like a top 25 program and its great to be part of that

3690808 obviously its disappointing but hes taken the decision to move on because of family reasons and everyone knows family always comes first so good luck to him
3690809 at times he gullit was a little disrespectful and that bothered me
3690810 from ruuds standpoint i think its been difficult for him
3690811 if youve been in a certain way of soccer for 40 years and you come somewhere where you cant get the players you want you cant do the things you want you dont have an unlimited budget you have other issues around you that affect things then it makes it very difficult
3690812 its not easy and not a lot of foreign coaches have done well here for that reason
3690813 its disappointing to lose somebody whos a good coach and a good person
3690814 but it happens in football clubs and its happened here maybe it happened too early but we wish him good luck in whatever he goes on and does

3690831 a number of factors inimical to growth have intensified in 2008
3690832 expected losses from u s sub prime exposures have by now been mostly acknowledged it is too early to assess whether the worst of the turmoil and loss of asset values is behind us
3690833 there may be further setbacks in the months to come but broadly financial conditions are not likely to stabilize before early 2009
3690834 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3690835 i think a drop of 20 percent is a bit over done
3690836 weve fallen too far too fast i expect the market to sit between 110 and 120 in the short term
3690837 have taken profits as theyve seen demand destruction in the u s and theyre seeing it spread a little into europe
3690838 u s gasoline demand last week was almost 4 percent lower compared to the same week in 2007 despite a considerable decline in retail prices
3690839 the question is where will the number level off at for china in the next few months
3690840 china is an enormous driver for the price of oil along with india brazil and the middle east
3690841 autos are the giants of energy consumption and pollution emissions and this is a major part of the effort to conserve resources and reduce emissions
3690842 we are of course not immune to the challenging environment around us and the sustained weakness across financial markets put pressure on earnings
3690843 combined with lower real estate and private equity valuations lower investment results accounted for the vast majority of the profit decline
3690844 the good news was that the company reduced its equity exposure again proved resiliant in the credit crisis and the balance sheet remained strong
3690845 i dont think the numbers are signaling the type of deep recessions we saw in the late 1990s and early 2001

3690855 i look at the election from whats good for viacom i vote for whats good for viacom i vote today viacom
3690856 but from a viacom standpoint the election of a republican administration is a better deal because the republican administration has stood for many things we believe in deregulation and so on the democrats are not bad people but from a viacom standpoint we believe the election of a republican administration is better for our company
3690857 believes that uk historical ad spending rises cannot be sustained as advertisers pull away from decaying circulation which has fallen by 33 in the past 20 years compared with a 19 fall in the us
3690858 cautioned that uk newspaper stocks which have fallen by 40 since the start of the year compared with us papers down by 48 could fall farther
3690859 every media company will be affected in the downturn some are structurally doomed to be blunt others are cyclically challenged
3690860 to survive media companies have to make no acquisitions pay great care and attention to their core products and ensure they have solid banking relationships then they have to take a realistic rather than an overly optimistic view of just how long this is going to last
3690861 discarding fish not only means a massive waste of food and potential income it also leads to unrecorded catches resulting in a poorer scientific basis for our management decisions
3690862 i want a requirement that all fish caught in norwegian waters also by foreign vessels must be taken to port regardless of which final port is used we will introduce new requirements as a condition for obtaining licenses to fish that vessels cannot discard valuable fish caught here
3690863 this must stop now the eu community cannot be taken seriously if it allows this kind of behaviour this is certainly not how to manage the worlds resources
3690864 it is a disgrace this practice is depleting populations that are already overfished and it is happening everywhere
3690865 all of these fish are perfectly marketable and have been legally caught but if you are a fisherman it makes more economic sense to take boat to market with the most saleable fish so you discard the lowest value stuff
3690866 it is out of contact we very rarely fish in norwegian waters thats the first time in years
3690867 the reason there are discards is the ridiculously low quotas fishermen cannot make a living with them they are at a ridiculous level
3690868 throwing dead fish back into the sea is a waste that nobody wants to see but there is no easy answer the uk is keen to ensure more effective and sustainable fisheries by reducing by catch and discards and the government is working closely with fishermen to achieve that

3690881 ea sports delivers platform specific experience for fifa soccer 09
3690882 were hitting this season in terms of quality and innovation stronger than we ever have at ea sports if im wrong youll see me sporting a new tattoo maybe a competitors logo
3690883 the best way to explain it is that i became completely present to this moment attachment to the story of a past and a future fell away
3690884 so there is the experiencing of total liberation from self
3690885 in all my years in the industry ive never seen a game with zero bugs
3690886 in all my years of buying and in most cases enjoying video games i have never seen so many bugs in ncaa football 09
3690887 you don t have to wait anymore until your friend makes his shot
3690888 i read the forums i read your posts on my blog and we do extensive research and testing to deliver the best sports games on the market each year we care what you say we respond as much as we possibly can
3690889 we own the rights we dont want your business go away and you get nada from us
3690890 omg they made a change because we asked for it
3690891 people sitting behind my keyboard typing angrily at the embarrassing and stupid statements moore just posted today
3690892 i read the forums i read your posts on my blog and we do extensive research and testing to deliver the best sports games on the market each year
3690893 did he give any consideration to those of us who do not own consoles we were completly turned away
3690894 the real issue is that while ea worked hard on making all play refining online adding 5 on 5 and upping the overall on field look of madden all the modes you remember from 08 and 07 are left almost identical to what they were previously
3690895 that does not mean that we arent coming back next year with new innovative maybe even less expensive ways to play all of our franchises on the pc
3690896 the object is to get you to buy the game each year not to extend the life of the previous years game
3690897 miles i dont play pc games because they always suck comapred to the console versions
3690898 were too lazy to port our pc games over to the next gen engine
3690899 how dare you expect unique games and not a roster update every year
3690900 no fifa on the pc wouldnt bother me too much
3690901 the pc as a platform for authentic fully licensed simulation sports games has declined radically in the past three years as the next generation consoles with their high definition graphics and 5 1 sound capabilities have attracted millions of consumers
3690902 theres a few in the camp that says alright i get it and then theres the haters it may be the same person with 10 different handles
3690903 bunch of stubborn close minded creatures who just dont understand how business works
3690904 well there is only an abundance of mmos fps and rts games
3690905 gone are the days of pc dominance the pc is no longer the pinnacle of graphical excellence and therefore gaming excellence gone are the days of stripped down pc ports to the consoles consoles have finally equaled there pc brother in terms of game quality and performance
3690906 crysis was an ok game but hardly a game that needs a pc
3690907 it costs 2 000 to have a good gaming pc
3690908 i am sick of hearing that pc gaming is supposedly dead
3690909 they make games on pcs not consoles your console cant make anything
3690910 ea doesnt support pc gamers pc gamers shouldnt by anything thats ea
3690911 the problem is most pc gamers are not as stupid as most console gamers and actually expect a good game for 50 00 or 60 00 bucks they dont buy every turd game you release just because you run a few commercials and buy off some critics
3690912 this goes back to my original statement that pcs are for mmos and rts only and some fpss
3690913 while a high end gaming pc is many times more powerful than current generation consoles and you could in theory do significantly greater things on it the downsides of the platform are having to support multiple generations of different hardware and driver interface layers ive got all sorts of details i could go into about comparative performance on the pc relative to the consoles on current id tech 5 stuff but it comes down to developing games costs tens of millions of dollars now and the focus just has to be on the consoles where youve got the chance to move more millions of units there the pc can at least still be profitably supported on there but itll be interesting to see if that continues to trend downward
3690914 world of warcraft obviously showed theres incredibly successful markets available on the pc they just probably dont look like the traditional shooter games that id software had made in the past
3690915 at this moment and nothings ever set in stone with us but we have been looking at a quake arena follow on as an id tech 5 based cross platform title but that is currently not slated right now we have decided to move ahead with a doom 4 title cross platform
3690916 i just finished my masters degree in buisness in the university of calgary in canada and all this stuff about buisness aspects is all horse crap im sure people on pc gamers would rather pay 50 60 dollars for a good game on pc than 20 30 dollars for a 5 cent production game
3690917 you say not everyone has a gaming pc thats true but everyone has a pc
3690918 if you would stop feeding yourself all that bull turd your eyes might be actually opened to see the potential profit in the pc market present a good product properly advertise it and then come talk to me about sales after
3690919 you say that the decision is based upon economics i call bullshit in that i know for a fact that programmers coders and modellers all work on multiple titles
3690920 never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake
3690921 we have no intention to abandon the pc as a sports gaming platform
3690922 we had a big role in getting overtaken studios to fail
3690923 contrary to some of the passionate posts on this blog we have no intention to abandon the pc as a sports gaming platform
3690924 this year we dont plan to ship madden ncaa football nascar tiger woods pga tour or nba live for the pc platform
3690925 this thread is just too funny most of you swear off ea for not making pc games now and then say you will buy competitors the funny thing is there arent competitors so i guess none of you will be buying any games at all thats a shame because games are fun if youre mad about no pc sports games thats perfectly understandable but dont be mad at peter be mad at the rest of the world for not caring about pc sports keyword sports games and thus there being no mass market for them its all business in the sports genre its all on consoles either accept that fact or just keep convincing yourself that ea is just trying to stick it to you for no good reason which sounds more logical
3690926 oh you cant have an ambulance on the football field thats not pc what about the disabled

3690928 i started my real estate sales career in 1985 with a large independent firm
3690929 fast forward 23 years later tonight i spoke to a realtor who didnt know the agent in her office i was referring to they both worked there several years she didnt know many of the realtors in her 150 person office she arrives at her sprawling place of business and walks straight to her office without speaking to anyone there is a lack on connection with others in our business in the late 90s our large independent firm was one of 350 offices swallowed up around the country there are no more softball games after hours jam sessions or free love the mega brokers took the power away from our realtors they didnt want free thinkers team builders and entrepreneurs it was ok to have real estate companies that didnt make a decent profit the goal for these brokerages was not about making money on the real estate side they wanted to sell the realtors and their clients everything from a lawn mower to a vacation the realtors and their clients became a means to an end having 150 mediocre agents was better than 25 super stars i know this story well it happened to me too i was depressed lost my creative juices and my belief i was to special and unique

3690934 puretext only removes rich formatting from text this includes the font face font style bold italics etc font color paragraph styles left right center aligned margins character spacing bullets subscript superscript tables charts pictures embedded objects etc however it does not modify the actual text it will not remove or fix new lines carriage returns tabs or other white space it will not fix word wrap or clean up your paragraphs if you copy the source code of a web page to the clipboard it is not going to remove all the html tags if you copy text from an actual web page not the source of the page it will remove the formatting puretext is basically equivalent to opening notepad doing a paste followed by a select all and then a copy the benefit of puretext is performing all these actions with a single hot key and having the result pasted into the current window automatically
3690935 if part of our problem is that the chinese are going to eat meat and youve got to have corn and soybeans to feed the chinese their meat then why isnt it just as legitimate for the chinese to go back and eat rice as it is for us to change our policy on corn to ethanol

3690938 i also think its wong headed to describe these people as is often the case in a kind of hackneyed fashion to describe these american jewish elites as being zionists or to discuss the zionist lobby they are not zionists and to call them that is totally to i think mislabel the nature of the beast as it were because they have no ideological commitments at all apart from the commitments to themselves theyre interested in power and their interested in privilege that happens to serve that personal agenda now to be pro israel and to remember the nazi holocaust
3690939 this is pure power and privilege its not ideology and i think its completely mistaken and wrong headed to describe them as zionists hoodlums for sure crooks no doubt thieves unquestionable ruthless yes reckless yes zionists no
3690940 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
3690941 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
3690942 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3690943 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
3690944 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
3690945 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
3690946 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
3690947 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
3690948 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself

3690950 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
3690951 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
3690952 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
3690953 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
3690954 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
3690955 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
3690956 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds

3690959 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves

3691194 sexual dysfunction among older adults prevalence and risk factors from a nationally representative u s probability sample of men and women 57 to 85 years of age
3691195 the results point to a need for physicians who are treating older adults experiencing sexual problems to take into account their physical health and also consider their mental health and their satisfaction with their intimate relationship in making any assessment
3691196 understandably one of the most common questions posed by breast cancer survivors is what are the chances of it coming back
3691197 now we can tell some women within a certain percentage their future risk of recurrence and clinicians may be able to make more informed decisions regarding prescription of extended adjuvant endocrine therapy
3691198 the magnitude of risk of recurrence should indicate a need for us to consider extended endocrine treatment for eligible women to further lower their risks
3691199 possible explanations for this trend include both increased demand for contraceptive services e g because of changing contraceptive use patterns and improved financial accessibility of contraceptive care within the private sector e g because of better insurance coverage of contraceptive services

3691201 there is potential that this continuing research will have huge clinical implications
3691202 if we can define the mechanism for recovery the translation of these findings to the clinic will dictate how much massage is needed for how long and when it should be performed after exercise
3691203 we tried to mimic swedish massage because anecdotally its the most popular technique used by athletes
3691204 a review of the research in this area shows that despite the existing anecdotal evidence we know athletes use massage all the time researchers dont know the mechanism of how massage improves recovery after exercise and injury
3691205 its hard to describe exactly how the exercise intensity would be matched in a human but this was considered a significant amount of exercise that would likely cause muscle soreness and possible damage
3691206 we know biological tissues are sensitive to the magnitude of frequency duration and load so we controlled the force frequency and time spent on massage
3691207 one fundamental question is how much of a role does inflammation play in repair to a muscle are we preventing inflammation and therefore improving recovery we havent proven that yet
3691208 our goal is to use this model to understand the biological mechanisms of massage as a guide to preclinical trials to test the effects of massage on muscle recovery after exercise
3691209 a trial in humans could look at optimal indications for massage
3691210 ultimately we could also find out how massage helps not just exercise induced muscle injury but swelling and pain associated with other medical conditions as well
3691211 is there one that is better than the others when it comes to finding good and nutritious food lets find out
3691212 there is no evidence that its more nutritious theres no evidence that its more safe its not sustainable its not any healthier
3691213 for us organic biotech and conventional are all management systems and you use them in terms of balance in how it fits into your operation
3691214 im comfortable with knowing that farmers are good stewards of what theyre doing and therefore that the food that is raised conventionally or through biotech is safe
3691215 for many people organic agriculture and food biotechnology is an either or proposition and in actuality all of these food processes produce foods that are healthy and of benefit
3691216 the long awaited magic bullet cure for cancer hasnt materialized now were thinking more in terms of long term control such as is the case with high blood pressure or diabetes the way to make that happen sooner is to use our current ammunition more affectively
3691217 i am very happy to see that we are consolidating our strong relationships within the us the nci relationship opens up for us new and exciting opportunities within the field of cancer and we are proud to join forces with one of the most prestigious and well established cancer research organisations in the world in the collaboration with nci bavarian nordic benefits from the enormous expertise in cancer therapeutics development that is present in the nci organisation this will truly strengthen cancer as a strategic focus area in years to come in line with our outlined strategy
3691218 our goal is to help make the iaff the first smoke free union
3691219 we congratulate the iaff for its commitment to this campaign and look forward to working together toward the goal of a smoke free union
3691220 fire fighters are respected leaders in their communities and this program on smoking cessation reaffirms that leadership
3691221 fire fighters place themselves in harms way confront dangerous environments high heat and flames and exposure to burning materials
3691222 its stressful work and some respond to stress by smoking yet smoking increases the health risks fire fighters face we want to help prevent that
3691223 our results indicate that needle free nasal immunization using a combination of nanoemulsion and hepatitis b antigen could be a safe and effective hepatitis b vaccine and also provide an alternative booster method for existing vaccines
3691224 our studies however indicate no inflammation and no evidence of the vaccine in the olfactory bulb
3691225 this trials remarkable results demonstrated our plx ms cells ability to prevent the appearance of multiple sclerosis symptoms and showed the potential for our plx cells to treat global autoimmune diseases as a cellular therapy our plx cells which are derived from human placenta a non controversial non embryonic adult stem cell source and stored ready to use could prove to be a readily available preventive therapeutic alternative for these disorders
3691226 manipulating this microrna provides a completely new way of addressing cardiovascular disorders
3691227 microrna research represents a new frontier in understanding and treating human disease this is just a hint of what can come
3691228 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
3691229 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really cant understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere
3691230 this becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as china india and brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated
3691231 this chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern
3691232 weve speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting
3691233 the reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures which is the opposite of most chemical reactions
3691234 the rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure and most reactions dont depend on external pressure the molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties
3691235 this is not how we explain chemistry to high school students
3691236 heres a situation where we were studying this purely environmental problem but because the findings are so fundamental it may have broader ramifications to biological systems that depend on hydrogen bonds
3691237 the key is knowing where to look and how to identify new chemical entities and with the computing resources we have at purdue we can help identify processes to within experimental uncertainty
3691238 we couldnt have done this without the supercomputing power that we have available
3691239 at obagi medical we pride ourselves on being business partners with physicians and delivering innovative skin health products
3691240 with the launch of our solubilized bpo technology as a prescription only product in the pharmacy channel we continue to offer more options to our physicians the launch of soluclenz rx gel will help dermatologists not only meet but exceed their patients expectations
3691241 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
3691242 we had encouraging results including several long term survivors in patients with stage iv cancers that had spread to distant sites
3691243 previous studies determined the maximal radiotherapy doses for single organs
3691244 but this technique has not been tested for simultaneous use on multiple organs so we designed a dose escalation trial to determine the optimal dose starting with fairly low levels and increasing the dose in later groups of patients
3691245 we have seen improved response rates with higher radiation doses without an increase in side effects yet
3691246 and several of them remain disease free one of them three years after treatment
3691247 there is a tiny cell component that is unique to germ cells the precursors to egg and sperm called nuage which means cloud in french other researchers recently suspected that nuage was involved in keeping genes from jumping around in germ cells of the female fruit fly
3691248 but until this mouse study no one knew for sure if it was involved in mammalian germ cells to test if the mouse nuage played a similar role in mammals we focused on a mouse protein called maelstrom whose distant relative protein in the fruit fly was implicated in the other study
3691249 we found that without the gene the process of meiosis was severely impaired
3691250 there was a profound defect in interactions of parental chromosomes a process known as synapsis leading to death of germ cells this was clear evidence that the protein is vital to the formation of sperm
3691251 we observed massive flooding of the cytoplasm and nuclei of germ cells by transposons in the mutant mice
3691252 this was the first time such a phenomenon was observed in germ cells of any species
3691253 since the jumping genes are not silenced just once during the development of the fetus but every time new sperm are produced during a mouse life its possible that germ cells may employ transposons in some fundamental way in male germline meiosis this research is the first such clue of that possibility we will be very busy over the next few years trying to crack this and other puzzles of maelstroms role in controlling meiosis and sperm production
3691254 this accreditation is a real landmark not only for usp but for public health as well measurement technology has made significant strides in the past decades by adhering to the more stringent criteria required to become an authorized producer of crm usp is staying at the forefront of advances to assure the quality strength and purity of medicines and food ingredients those who rely on usp standards worldwide will welcome this additional measure

3691258 its not very often you get to live your dream or do something you have chased your whole life so just to be here is awesome to play alongside players i was looking up to two or three years ago is a great honour and just to be part of a massive legacy and the traditions that go along with the all blacks is fantastic
3691259 well its being an all black certainly a goal every year but some years it is just more realistic than others
3691260 i think this year i wasnt sure what was going to happen with the season ahead with an injury but the coaches have seen past that and saw it as a time to give me an opportunity the challenge for me now is to repay the faith put in me by the coaches by playing some good rugby
3691261 i dont know if frustrating is the right word but i really wanted to get out there
3691262 they the coaches put me through my paces a bit at training and i guess that was them just ensuring i had done my dues before donning the jersey
3691263 just the whole week leading up to that game was outstanding knowing i was actually going to play my first test was a special feeling that whole week was special for me the preparation the support and then to turn up on the saturday and put the jersey on was something i will never ever forget
3691264 im happy playing anywhere for the all blacks id play hooker if i had too
3691265 im comfortable on the wing obviously centre is my first choice position but i will play wing or full back too if they need me the challenge i face is making the team on a regular basis and nailing down one position
3691266 obviously theyre habana and pietersen two very quick and prolific wingers
3691267 but from my point of view the skill set required on the wing is no different to playing thirteen apart from there is a little more defensive kicking to do
3691268 there are just a few little things i have to be aware of like positional play for kicking but i am more than comfortable with that so we will just see what happens on saturday
3691269 he is someone who has huge respect within the team
3691270 no question he is one of the genuine leaders and always leads by example for the rest of the boys to follow
3691271 the week leading up to my debut he was always talking to me and making sure i was as settled as i could be its great to have someone like that to help you settle into the way of the all blacks he is a tremendous asset to us as individuals and as a team
3691272 in terms of his leadership he is second to none and as you saw when he came back against the aussies he makes a huge difference in just giving the side some extra guidance but we have other guys like mils muliaina rodney sooialo and kev mealamu who are all leaders and have good leadership skills its good for us young guys to get in with them and have them leading the charge
3691273 any university will strongly advise against the rushed decisions that can be a consequence of the clearing process and it seems that we could help ourselves and applicants who may already have the qualifications they need by creating greater awareness of an extended summer recruitment period for applicants
3691274 as well as possibly helping to widen participation it might also help to reduce dropout rates which are of concern across the sector

3691282 they dropped proceedings to pour all their energies into each other but madonna now feels they are stable enough to press ahead with the adoption again
3691283 we know that it is mercy who madonna really wants we heard it is because my granddaughter is such a beautiful happy child
3691284 twice i have told the adoption people that i do not want mercy to go outside the country
3691285 but they keep on at us now they say that mercy will be leaving us but can return at age 18 yet i might not be alive then

3691478 the opinions of female employees towards their work and their treatment in the workplace are hugely authoritative tools for revealing the true nature of the business environment from a womans perspective in the middle east today in tracking and monitoring this data organisations and businesses across the entire region can benefit from the findings allowing them to adjust or develop new sets of measures or behaviours for promoting crucial gender equality
3691479 gauging the availability and popularity of these different facilities provides a valuable look at what measures and services employers are currently making available for women and point to what employers could be doing to further improve the working life for women especially those that balance their work and a family this is critical in light of the fact that 80 of respondents have indicated that more benefits would extend their working life
3691480 with ever greater calls for increasing the number of the regions nationals in domestic workforces women have a more strategic role to play in the further economic development and growth of the middle east than ever before data such as this offers a wide array of benefits to hr industry players recruiters and online recruitment sites like bayt com by providing detailed considered insights into what it really means to be an employed woman in the middle east overall these insights serve to offer indications and drivers that can ultimately effect positive change for greater workplace equality
3691481 in spite of several gender based disadvantages and additional familial responsibilities what struck me as being truly remarkable was the sheer determination of women to succeed this is clearly evident from the majority of women 72 who said they would prefer to work even if they were given the option not to the majority are also equally or more ambitious 84 and work an equal to more number of hours 89 than their male counterparts its time employers sit up and take notice of this vital segment of their workforce as research reveals that if provided simple benefits it would increase the longevity of 80 of womens careers which will have a long term beneficial impact on the business and the economy as a whole
3691482 we are running as an unofficial labor ticket but we wont always be voting with one another as jeff whitton and i have proven during our last term on council

3691485 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3691486 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3691487 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3691488 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3691489 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3691490 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3691491 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3691492 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3691493 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3691494 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3691495 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3691496 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3691497 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3691498 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3691499 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3691500 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3691501 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3691502 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3691503 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3691504 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3691505 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3691506 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3691507 we are of course not immune to the challenging environment around us and the sustained weakness across financial markets put pressure on earnings
3691508 combined with lower real estate and private equity valuations lower investment results accounted for the vast majority of the profit decline
3691509 the good news was that the company reduced its equity exposure again proved resiliant in the credit crisis and the balance sheet remained strong
3691510 die mens zal dat design wel maken of het development doen
3691511 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3691512 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3691513 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3691514 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3691515 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3691516 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3691517 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3691518 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3691519 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3691520 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3691521 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3691522 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3691523 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3691524 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3691525 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3691526 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3691527 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3691528 there is nothing negative about a name like coca cola or mcdonalds today in the 1970s maybe it was
3691529 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent
3691530 i have at all times tried to fair and honest with the students the faculty the staff and the community
3691531 at all times i have done what i have felt was in the best interests of the high school

3691541 when i first met with the project manager i was told they were going to
3691542 the first response i got when i tried to find out what happened to them was they had been stockpiled the second response i got on monday was they were no good and wouldnt be replanted
3691543 as part of the public private partnership ppp requirements an arborist provided advice about the removal and replanting of trees and the redevelopment site
3691544 due to the size and age of the trees only two or three were able to be replanted
3691545 an arborist in consultation with project developers and a flora and fauna working party have a plan to plant 376 new trees across the site
3691546 everyone has their stories and most of the sad one you keep close to your heart but by the same token i have seen a lot of good things over the years

3691555 we will improve the vista without detracting from the areas mining history

3691557 we feel we have a social responsibly in relation to the community
3691558 in this current market we really need to ensure we have good local support
3691559 i think that close to 100 per cent of the land around orange has been pegged and subject to similar exploration activity by other companies
3691560 its pretty exciting to be out there with the big boys from queensland and come home with a broad ribbon when you only have a few cows
3691561 we bought augusta from the job family as a heifer and have had a lot of fun showing her locally taking out the supreme shorthorn exhibit at orange show this year and bathurst royal last year
3691562 we now have a grand total of 14 cows both shorthorn and angus and we are really targeting quality not quantity in our sire selection and breeding
3691563 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3691564 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3691565 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3691566 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3691567 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3691568 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3691569 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3691570 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3691571 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3691572 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3691573 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3691574 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3691575 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3691576 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3691577 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3691578 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3691579 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3691580 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3691581 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3691582 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3691583 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3691584 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3691585 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3691586 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3691587 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

3691595 no 2 is making emissions better and using less gas
3691596 we are targeting pickups suvs and vans thats the really big market
3691597 if you start with a gas guzzler that gets 12 miles per gallon or a school bus that gets 7 miles per gallon and increase that the impact is far bigger

3691603 if some of the other countries had the same rules we had for immigration very few americans would get through any embassies unless they were ready to lie through their teeth no it s not a perfect world but some people actually tell the truth and stereotypes and bias should not be the guideline for inclusion as it is only the vehicle for exclusion american embassies should not serve to exclude but to include based on real accurate facts not on innuendo

3691610 development which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
3691611 recognised the importance of affordable and convenient energy in achieving that whilst underlining the importance of protecting the environment
3691612 claims should always avoid the vague use of terms such as sustainable green non polluting and so on
3691613 because sustainable was an ambiguous term and because we had not seen data that showed how shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oil sands projects in order to limit climate change we concluded that on this point the ad was misleading

3691634 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
3691635 you want people to think well of you dont you
3691636 its great to be an olympian but were trying to put that thrill behind us were here to get on the podium
3691637 fortunately for us weve seen this level and our coaches have put us up against the top four or five teams in the world consistently
3691638 so yeah were ranked 11th in the world but weve seen these teams before weve seen that level of intensity and we can play at that level its just a matter of being able to put it together for 70 minutes instead of 30 minutes here 25 minutes there
3691639 whether it be every single play clearing it out of the defense or putting the ball into the cage kind of that extra disciplined edge once we get that i think well be ok
3691640 it kind of bonds us together doing joke things i think the future of this team is from that area
3691641 even though we like to see ourselves as being in their company its a very tall order to win these games
3691642 it really is what the tie suggests we need to close the gaps and were disappointed we didnt come out with a win
3691643 they had her ready then they made her stop then they did it again they tried to break her concentration and they did it
3691644 south koreas park said yesterday that he will try his best to defeat you
3691645 so do you think in this planet is there anyone who can defeat you and if so who is it
3691646 to be at the top of so many great athletes
3691647 but it wasnt easy to put that race behind me
3691648 all the emotion that went into that relay i had friends texting me all afternoon saying i cant sleep im still fired up about that race and im not even out there
3691649 and im like well im not napping if you guys keep texting me
3691650 if we trained the horses like we did the people wed kill them
3691651 im awful at math during an interview session yesterday he admitted later that he has matured from a subject of the process to a student of it
3691652 i think the biggest part ive been able to improve on is my underwaters phelps said
3691653 for the first time ive been watching my kickouts my dives have been perfect the right number of kicks and the number of meters off the wall so im getting every little thing you can throw into the equation
3691654 jed did a nice job in the limited plays that he had offensively but also on special teams
3691655 that fullback position youve got to produce on special teams or youre going to struggle to make it there collins did the best job of the other guys on the special teams unit
3691656 there are 11 starters on offense and 11 starters on defense if you aint one of them you better be good at special teams
3691657 special teams keeps you around and that gives you a chance to make plays in other ways
3691658 you can get in the rotation and get a chance to make plays on offense or defense because of what you do on special teams because if you dont make it on special teams you definitely wont get a chance to make it on offense or defense
3691659 weve got guys that have got to be major contributors on special teams
3691660 that is a major area of emphasis for us just making sure that we have the guys out there that can provide us the best chance of success
3691661 if you arent a starter you really have to make a living as a special teams player
3691662 there are a lot of good position players out there who cant play special teams who dont end up making it
3691663 special teams is an important part of the game its a third of it and a lot of valuable field position can be determined by it an older guy like myself i try to preach it to the younger guys
3691664 right now were still negotiating i hope it comes to fruition but theres no deal yet
3691665 call right back but did not pelinka did not respond to several messages
3691666 they got the hit where we couldnt in the ninth inning
3691667 its only a matter of time hes a tremendous pitcher hes going to win a lot of games
3691668 i was just frustrated with myself because i knew i had him
3691669 if i would have thrown it anywhere remotely in that zone i think he would have taken it for a strike and i just wasnt able to do it
3691670 and i was just frustrated just because when you know you have a guy you really have to execute and i wasnt able to execute
3691671 i had to practice what i preach stay in the moment
3691672 i did look up at the scoreboard and notice but i quickly switched myself to our philosophy
3691673 he only did one event today and boy did he knock it out of the park
3691674 i just did one event these guys did the whole meet
3691675 i owed them more than anything i fed off their energy if i was there by myself i would have been soiling my pants
3691676 i knew this team whatever way we put it we could medal
3691677 we have a better three up three count team than people give us credit for
3691678 i know a lot of people doubted wed even make it to the second day we knew we could do this
3691679 we were the underdog team for sure we had to hit and we did
3691680 everyone was a little nervous freakin out a little bit about the meet we just talked to each other a long heart to heart
3691681 we figured were the underdog team weve got nothing to lose
3691682 who are these guys paul and morgan arent in we have zero olympic experience but youve got to talk about that stuff its looming i felt like my whole body got less tense
3691683 nah i dont think so sheppard said when asked yesterday if this would be a problem for him
3691684 well yeah samuel said yesterday in his long delayed first media session of training camp when asked if he understood what sheppard is going through
3691685 we talk about it being that i went through a situation last year so i can give him my pointers and my opinion on the whole situation we can relate to that definitely
3691686 we have a real good relationship samuel said of sheppard
3691687 my first year up here he kind of shows me the ropes sheldon does too were all pretty tight its a good relationship its no bad blood with anybody a situation is a situation and everybody goes through a situation but that doesnt affect us we go out there weve got a job to do
3691688 im a competitor at heart i love to compete samuel said
3691689 when im watching film and i see my teammates out there competing and getting after it and making plays something just comes into me makes me want to get out there
3691690 i think hes learning it and picking it up as expected sheppard said of samuel
3691691 but weve still got a couple weeks before the season gets started hes still got a lot to learn and a lot of time to improve
3691692 i think the more time you have together the more comfortable and relaxed you are to play together brown said
3691693 all that will take care of itself when it needs to be taken care of
3691694 as much as possible he said he trusts the coaches to balance the healing of his hamstring against the need for familiarity
3691695 he said what he had to say brown said of sheppard who last week was critical of team owner luries contention that lito needs to improve his ypa or yards per pass attempt against him
3691696 a lot of unity out here a lot of unity a lot of love
3691697 i can feel the love and i can feel excitement he said
3691698 you know theyre talking mess and talking crud i definitely feel that they want to see me out there and see what i can do for the team
3691699 he hasnt had a lot of glitches in his appearances i felt very comfortable with him
3691700 just like skip we were fans of the team in the lean years in the 70s and the 80s
3691701 we tuned in to listen to the funny one liners
3691702 as ceo of the braves i declare today a public celebration throughout braves nation in honor of skip caray
3691703 the commissioner of baseball bud selig joins me in that proclamation
3691704 by my count thats nearly 5 000 games that we did together and it never got old
3691705 were always going to recall that attitude that made skip skip if he was here today and a foul ball was hit to you hed be able to tell you where you were from
3691706 so today instead of saying goodbye lets all just say thank you thank you skip for letting us all be a part of your life
3691707 ryan klesko is running the right routes we just cant get the ball to him
3691708 you all were the bass notes to the soundtrack of my fathers life
3691709 i think they are going to see how it does in 3 weeks and see how it responds to being immobilized and go from there
3691710 these are certain things that happen sometimes to players when you think about sometimes the bone pulling off i know that sounds kind of odd but that actually happens sometimes its not the best case scenario it certainly isnt the norm but at the same time the hard part about it is that piece of bone isnt that big its not like you can just take a screw and fix it like a fracture you cant take a little pin and just put it in there so the best thing to do is to maybe let it scar back over and see what happens to it
3691711 i told you guys at the start of the season that he was one of the big parts of our bullpen and keeping him healthy was something we needed to do were going to miss flash somebody has to step up and do his job i know we have the people down there to do that
3691712 were in a position where we need to step it up
3691713 we need to try to see if we cant put a little bigger lead between us and the mets and the marlins weve got to win some games
3691714 were having trouble right now scoring runs through our lineup
3691715 on nights where we score a lot of runs our bottom of the lineup contributes when they dont contribute that cuts the game short
3691716 they know that were coming back to redeem ourselves and im pretty sure that they watch us a lot
3691717 has been circled on my calendar for about 2 years now
3691718 weve got veterans were preparing ourselves every night were showcasing what weve been doing the last 3 years getting ready for this moment
3691719 so we cant afford to go out and be lackadaisical
3691720 we were not looking ahead i thought we played with really good energy in spurts and played some really terrific basketball
3691721 our goal wasnt to win by a certain margin it was to really work hard and keep up our pressure and then once that was done we just worked on a few other things the main thing was just to keep some consistency so overall i was very pleased with tonight
3691722 i just dont know how many times you can do this
3691723 to be 10 runs down to come back to take the lead and then to lose its just too mentally and physically draining it gets old
3691724 you cant go through the whole training camp without having a starter there i think next week is when hell start practicing and well just take it from there hes in good shape his spirits are high yall will see the big kid pretty soon
3691725 thats important having all five guys playing together with many reps because its critical that they play well together as a unit
3691726 hes working on some things hes got to get through it if youre not taking care of yourself youre definitely not going to be the same football player you were so youve got to get that part worked out
3691727 i want to see how different it is what teams i can use its going to be fun figuring out the ins and outs of the game
3691728 playing football makes you a better madden player you realize what coverages there are whats open and not open what you can run and you cant run
3691729 weve the ioc been saying youre missing a great opportunity to get more of your people in here to celebrate your games
3691730 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and everybody has the opportunity to enjoy the festivities

3691737 i think thats something that youve got to talk to coach childress about or the trainers
3691738 the decision was based purely on numbers on performance and carpenter has outperformed him right now thats the bottom line
3691739 we chart a ton of categories with the kickers and carpenter has outperformed him
3691740 obviously teens still like international celebrities but the fact that they chose indiana evans over miley cyrus shows they often still connect a lot more with aussie celebs

3691742 a member of the u s olympic diving team was disqualified from competition today when it was learned that he did not have a sufficiently compelling human story line to exploit on the nbc telecast of the worldwide sporting event
3691743 tracy klujian the expelled diver was not raised by a single mother never had a career threatening injury and did not overcome a personal tragedy of any kind before making the olympic diving team u s olympic officials revealed today
3691744 may it be to the world what i believe it will be to some parts sooner to others later but finally to all the signal of arousing men to burst the chains and to assume the blessings and security of self government
3691745 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3691746 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3691747 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3691748 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3691749 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3691750 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3691751 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3691754 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3691755 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3691756 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3691757 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3691758 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3691759 were aiming to emulate the spirit and excitement of the olympic games with this promotion

3691789 i was feeling a little bit of panic because of the injury
3691790 it really hurt when it happened when it first kind of pulled when i was on the ground it kind of eased up a little bit it could have been adrenaline or whatever
3691791 the same thing happened to me in 2004 when i was in college it started playing with my mind and messing with me a little bit that kind of got my confidence a little bit

3691794 i dont feel any aches or any twitching or anything like that

3691843 based on the tests we will bring some new compounds to the brno race weekend designed to offer the best grip and endurance the resurfacing job seems to have been done well but we will have to wait and see what our motogp riders make of it because theyll be going even quicker we certainly think the new surface will make the track considerably faster than it used to be because the old surface was in quite a bad state it will be the first time that motogp riders have used the new surface so it will be important to have a wider range of tires with a bigger step from say tire one to tire five than we might have at some other tracks

3691872 think of this as a 911 call you could make from home
3691873 the purpose of the rapid response team is to give you another set of expert eyes and ears
3691874 a large part of understanding what a candidate plans to do or offers to the county you can learn by looking at their backers and the people who put them in office its a classic follow the money issue

3692051 our greatest economic minds and policy makers seem unable to persuade us to re order our priorities for the world based on rational analysis of costs and benefits shouldnt we be concerned about the world are we making the wrong choices shouldnt the leading global economists and policy makers be concerned are they irrelevant and if they are irrelevant arent we too
3692052 an extra glass of wine for alexander the great matters more than all todays capital stock
3692053 i am not a diehard capitalist i do not view capitalism as a credo much more important to me are freedom compassion for the poor respect for the social contract and equal opportunity but for the moment to achieve those goals capitalism is the only game in town it is the only system we know that provides us with the tools required to create massive surplus value
3692054 our goal is to transform the world economy into one that is clean green and sustainable
3692055 californias public pension funds have already committed over 800 million to this effort through investments in environmental technology and they are actively pressing the corporate world to fully assess and disclose the risks and opportunities climate change presents for their business operations
3692056 forty years ago conservationists feared that humpback whales were being hunted to extinction now numbers have returned to such a level that they have been taken off the danger list
3692057 we are not surprised that commodities and more specifically gold and oil etcs continue to shatter records for trading volumes and inflows
3692058 the fact that an etc now trades more than the ftse100 etf is testament to the fact that investors have been wanting access to asset classes other than bonds and equities
3692059 with assets growing by nearly 500 in the past twelve months and volumes growing by more than 1 000 compared to the same period last year etcs have become an asset class that no one can ignore

3692061 to get more involved with government to promote the interests of the province
3692062 the university does promote the economy maybe not as a cheering section but in terms of the kind of research that is done theres actually a lot of co operation with the government
3692063 its very puzzling to know exactly what new direction would be implied
3692064 the ways in which we contribute has to be you know largely of our choosing
3692065 if in some way were supposed to be doing specific applied bits of research you know for the province rather than following our interests then there are questions of academic freedom looming
3692066 my research is meant to be useful it is meant to respond to the needs of the community and it has always done that
3692067 the point of the academic autonomy is that i dont have to come up with answers that support the current political agenda
3692068 dannys suggesting that ok we need to start working co operatively is silly because it has been done
3692069 i think what is perhaps a bit of a concern for some of our members is that with williams enthusiasm to intervene in the choice of a new president it may make professors work with government a bit more cautious because perhaps there is only certain types of work that hes going to endorse
3692070 eddy campbell the current acting president certainly has a vision of the university so we come down to well what is not satisfactory and why
3692071 it is very stupid for georgia to start a war with russia because we are very big and they are very small but that is always the way in history with georgia
3692072 they probably dont even know the name of the georgian president
3692073 in recent years georgia has become an increasingly important export market for our athletic looking girls in scanty bikinis sector
3692074 but we have to balance this against our dependence on russia as a market for guys called ronaldo who cant dribble weve got lots of these people all hanging round the favelas if we dont send them to perm and krasnoyarsk theyll end up joining drug gangs or something
3692075 we want to make sure we not only get the science right but we hope to make it very visual and understandable by a broad audience
3692076 its very important for us to present einstein accurately and intelligibly for the scientific community as well as the general public

3692080 it was the same guy who came to the door a week earlier claiming he wanted to fix the water heater he was wearing a blue construction hat so i had the door cracked and i thought just in case something like this were to happen have the door cracked so id have enough time to close it he turned like he was leaving then turned back i guess when i was closing the door and he pushed it open
3692081 i think thats the sickest the saddest the weakest thing ive ever heard of in my whole entire life
3692082 we dont know what the connection is at this point
3692083 may truly be a random dont know that at this point

3692095 i think whats happened here this morning is a misunderstanding of the law and thats perfectly understandable
3692096 weve got this new law in flux weve got the old law its very difficult to figure out how to even legally bring the handgun into the city so you can apply for the registry
3692097 firearms registration is a pretty complicated set of rules and regulations and they can be interpreted by reasonable people in different ways
3692098 im sure heller is making his own reasonable interpretation our understanding of the rule is that mr heller can legally bring his weapon here
3692099 we will do the best we can to accommodate him and get him a registration
3692100 it appears that the city does not yet understand the decision and order of the supreme court

3692102 mayor fenty promised us he would follow the letter and spirit of the law he has done neither

3692122 you could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread so you would be foolish not to
3692123 could this somehow be indirect russian action yes but considering russia is past playing nice and uses real bombs they could have attacked more strategic targets or eliminated the infrastructure kinetically
3692124 the attackers are using the same tools and the same attack commands that have been used by the r b n and in some cases the attacks are being launched from computers they are known to control

3692246 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3692247 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3692248 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

3692251 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3692252 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3692253 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

3692258 stefan sonnenfeld and company 3 and i have worked for the last three months to get the print looking like what you saw no matter how good the cinematography is there is new potential to make the image more impactful beyond what you can do on location or on the set so when you do blu ray you have an up rezing quality so things that were sharp before become sharper
3692259 things that are dimensional like the dragon lunging at the camera in blu ray really knock your head off because you are seeing all the details we put in it that are even a little better defined
3692260 the dark light values are better so you can be darker and still see all the detail plus you have many more layers of ancillary material and much more information
3692261 bolsters the argument that you can be hefty but still healthy or at least healthier than has been believed

3692276 if virgin nigeria can be treated in this way can any company in the world seriously consider investing in nigeria in the future
3692277 our normal flight operations will resume on thursday 14 august 2008 from the mma2 domestic terminal we wish to apologise for any inconvenience you passengers may experience as a result of this suspension
3692278 our regional and international flight operations will however remain at the murtala mohammed international airport lagos while domestic flight operations between abuja to kano and abuja to sokoto routes will continue as scheduled
3692279 the nigerian government asked virgin some years ago to set up a national carrier for nigeria that nigerians could put their trust in and be proud of virgin agreed to enable this to happen but made it clear that they would only invest considerable sums in nigeria under certain strict criteria one of those was the ability to operate domestic and international flights out of the same terminal which is the only way a flag carrier of any country can operate
3692280 to my utter dismay certain authorities in nigeria have chosen to ignore our contract sending in heavies a few months ago to smash up our domestic lounge with sledgehammers in an attempt to intimidate the airline
3692281 was not what i would have expected from the authorities in nigeria
3692282 the authorities behaved in a similar fashion despite a court case being imminent by sending in the heavies yet again to dismantle our domestic check in if virgin nigeria can be treated in this way can any company in the world seriously consider investing in nigeria in the future
3692283 to honour their contract and enable virgin nigeria to resume flying domestically with immediate effect giving the service to their passengers that theyve come to rely on and expect

3692298 the link between human activity and global warming became settled before march 2007
3692299 an overwhelming body of scientific evidence now clearly indicates that climate change is a serious and urgent issue the earths climate is rapidly changing mainly as a result of increases in greenhouse gases caused by human activities
3692300 work with government to reduce emissions over time and across the economy
3692301 but to misrepresent the evidence on an issue as important as global warming was surely irresponsible

3692304 positioning multimap as accessible and friendly was important and lbi creating this campaign was key to that the pigeon characters make the point that multimaps new functionality is ingenious and powerful whilst still being very easy to use
3692305 we worked with aardman animations because of their unrivalled expertise in creating charming characters with animation we wanted our pigeons to be cute but a bit daft too and we think aardman captured that perfectly we plan to make more of them as new features are launched

3692319 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3692320 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3692321 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
3692322 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
3692323 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp
3692324 but the big question remains what happens in the real world of human cancers
3692325 for instance weve learned that when someone has a haploid insufficiency and is missing one copy of the tgf gene he or she is more vulnerable to environmental insults that can cause cleft palate such as drugs smoking and alcohol
3692326 we found that if we blocked tgf or the receptors a cleft palate develops
3692327 but when smad4 was blocked normal palate epithelium still covered the palatal shelf
3692328 this information is useful not just for palate and teeth but also for cancer and cell biology in general
3692329 ultimately we have to be translational in order to make ourselves useful to patients
3692330 das immunsystem der m use bei denen wir die autophagie im thymus gezielt unterbunden haben ist regelrecht entgleist
3692331 wir k nnen nun neue arbeitshypothesen zur entstehung dieser leiden formulieren
3692332 wir wissen bereits seit fast zehn jahren dass eben diese zellen bei der entsch rfung autoreaktiver t zellen die also k rpereigene strukturen angreifen w rden wichtig sind
3692333 damals entdeckten wir mit kollegen in heidelberg dass die thymischen epithelzellen durch einen immer noch r tselhaften mechanismus in der lage sind praktisch jedes protein des k rpers zu produzieren unklar war jedoch wie es ihnen gelingt die f r die erziehung von t zellen wichtigen proteinschnipsel sogenannte epitope auf ihrer oberfl che zu pr sentieren
3692334 erstaunlicherweise bekommt praktisch jede unserer millionen von t zellen im thymus per zufallsprinzip einen anderen t zell rezeptor so dass das immunsystem fast jeden krankheitserreger erkennen kann
3692335 allerdings entstehen so auch rezeptoren die auf k rpereigene proteinbruchst cke reagieren w rden

3692337 die haut der tiere war schuppig und sie hatten massiv an gewicht verloren
3692338 allerdings wissen wir nicht warum sie nur einzelne organe befallen haben
3692339 f r uns war jedenfalls sehr interessant dass vor allem der darm so stark gesch digt wurde denn dieses krankheitsbild erinnert stark an das menschliche autoimmunleiden morbus crohn wir wollen jetzt kl ren wie autoreaktive t zellen der selektion im thymus entkommen k nnen und wie sich eine defekte autophagie im thymus auswirken kann denn dies sollte zu einem besseren verst ndnis der autoimmunerkrankungen und m glicherweise auch zu therapien f hren

3692375 no ones figured out how race affects this election but you cannot rule out race as a problem for some voters
3692376 obamas hurdles with voters are questions about his experience some policy differences and the feeling among some that he may be too liberal
3692377 the story of this fall campaign will be whether voters can get comfortable enough with him to trust him to lead the nation it really is about barack obama

3692497 rather than being a hostile preparatory act for war hezbollahs move to take control of mount sannine is a move made out of desperation with syria and israel moving toward a peace deal the walls are closing in on the militant movement and it needs the mountain to secure its core territory against a possible attack
3692498 israel eager to make a better showing against hezbollah than in the 2006 conflict would this time not hesitate to unleash its full force on the militant group also unlike in 2006 israel would enjoy syrian support against hezbollah hezbollah would suffer hostility along one of its most important supply lines and opposition from a close state ally

3692500 in the twentieth century there was a civil war between the arabs and the jews in arabia 800 000 jews living among 60 million arabs at that time left their homes versus 650 000 arab palestinians leaving their homes jews were integrated into communities while palestinians remained refugees since then let us call that even and get on with our lives as jews and arabs

3692502 hostility and wars is a pattern of behavior among arabs look at arabs they cannot live in peace with different others among themselves you have wars in yemen iraq lebanon algeria sudan syria etc which claimed and claims lives of millions but yet arabs choose to ignore all those extremely bloody conflicts and highlights relatively extremely mild form of conflict between palestinians and israelis arabs do not value a human life unless it is wasted by an israeli

3692571 i find it impossible to back against the big four opening their campaigns with all 3 points
3692572 manchester united chelsea and arsenal are all playing at home and between them lost just one game on their own patches last season so for me they look extremely good choices to get a result
3692573 i dont doubt harry redknapps portsmouth side will give big phil scolaris new team a serious test but i certainly wouldnt expect the blues four year unbeaten record at stamford bridge to end
3692574 the fixture list hasnt been kind to poor old tony mowbray as i dont envy his newly promoted side travelling to an often rampant arsenal side at the emirates thats a baptism of fire if ever there was one
3692575 sir alex may be without two of his most potent weapons in young wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo this weekend but united still possess enough in their armoury to overcome kevin keegans side and who knows they may well have another forward amongst their ranks by then
3692576 this has nothing to do with my old allegiances but more due to the strength of their side now livewire robbie keane has joined
3692577 i dont doubt arsenal and liverpool will push last seasons top two close but when examining the strength of sir alex and scolaris squads youll see they both possess the numbers the talents and above all the experience required
3692578 i am in no doubt hell have no problems whatsoever after all sparky has proven himself to be a good premier league manager at blackburn and has all the attributes to be a success at eastlands
3692579 i think he ferguson realises we werent too far away from them at the very top of their game i dont think theyve got another level to go to theyve had a lot of players in their team who hit peak form in the last two years rio ferdinands been awesome ronaldos been unbelievable i dont think well see that again
3692580 rooney tevez giggs at his age theyve all been fantastic but with injuries and stuff at our place we can still raise the bar
3692581 i watched villa last season and martin oneill is a very good coach he plays exciting attacking football and i am excited to be here
3692582 the uefa cup run with rangers last season was a fantastic experience even though we lost the final maybe i could do even better at villa this season it would be very good to have a good run in this competition
3692583 i am most incensed by the clause in cuellars contract but you cant really blame the player for wanting it in there
3692584 its the people who negotiated this contract who should have a look at themselves rangers fans are sick and tired of the way the club treats them and continues to sell our best players
3692585 those running the club should prepare for a backlash ive never seen so much anger the fans want answers
3692586 i am in total shock and feel betrayed because i thought the club had put this to bed last week
3692587 carlos was at our player of the year awards on friday night and said how proud he was to play for rangers and how much he loved the the club
3692588 i feel betrayed by him and im on an absolute downer
3692589 what these fans are doing is covered by the terms and conditions of their season ticket purchase we were contacted by some fans after the sale of carlos cuellar and we have agreed to take back season books in return for a cancellation fee

3692592 so i told the dealer im not going to pay a dollar more than 30 000 for this suv and why should i since gas prices are what they are and all
3692593 this guy had the nerve to tell me that this suv is still their number one selling vehicle despite the increased gas prices and that he would check with his manager but didnt think he would be able to go below 35 000
3692594 so i showed him i just turned right around and marched right out of there

3692618 you dont necessarily have to use a computer to understand how it shapes the country john mccain is aware of the internet
3692619 basically john is a technological troglodyte and proud of it
3692620 broadband will soon be an indispensable communication technology affecting the way we learn the way we work and the way we communicate
3692621 however at the dawn of this digital age those who could benefit the most from this economically empowering technology are also those most likely to be left without access because of where they live or how much money they make
3692622 the scientific and technical building blocks of our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength
3692623 what concerns me is that mccain will do as george bush did which is to make technology an issue related to how he raises money to run the government or to fund campaigns and not as an independent issue that is important to grow america
3692624 technology for the bush administration is a total non issue even though that was the thing that drove most growth in 1992 to 2003 and the reason i think hed be led to that is because hes a guy who doesnt understand anything about technology in the first place
3692625 i think that the people who determine his tech policies like former fcc chairman michael powell and a few others who were his top advisors will talk as bush has talked about getting advanced telecommunications services to all americans
3692626 but mainly their model is to allow the industry to determine what all this means which is the danger
3692627 far too little oversight to the good things in the 1996 telecommunications act
3692628 making sure there were equal opportunities to participate in the industry afforded to women and minorities and small businesses
3692629 there was a rush to essentially allow industry players to get into each others businesses and consolidate in the industry
3692630 their bush and mccain belief is that government should just get out of the way and let the private sector do it clearly in the financial markets the private sector has done a horrible job
3692631 i dont know whats going on but it has to do with oil it must be bad
3692632 what does this mean i dont know but it cant be good

3692644 noel had three or four other strikes one that hit the bar and hes always there or thereabouts
3692645 hes got an instinct for scoring and i hope that continues because you need goals to win games
3692646 we got there in the end and we deserved to win the game no question about that but it would have been nice if we could have done it sooner
3692647 but they did exactly what we thought they would and came made the game very difficult for us
3692648 i was disappointed with the way we played in the first half
3692649 i had to go off at the players at half time and im too old to be doing that in a carling cup match but i was annoyed with some of the lads because they turned up and were too sloppy
3692650 at this stage of the competition its just about getting through
3692651 we had enough chances to have won three or four times over
3692652 the match should have been taken away from bournemouth before the second half
3692653 we have a big squad now of 17 or 18 players and i would like to think that anyone has a point to prove when they get a chance
3692654 were delighted with him but not just because of his goals
3692655 the main reason we signed him is because of his work ethic you can never fault it and hopefully thatll rub off on the other players
3692656 it was never going to be an easy game they were boosted by a win at the weekend and we had a bad result it was important that we bounced back and we did that by putting ourselves into the next round
3692657 i thought we were in control of the game in the first half even though brian jensen made a good save we had numerous opportunities and i felt it was only a matter of time before we scored and we got a very well worked goal
3692658 we could have passed the ball better in the second half but full credit to bury brian had to pull off a great double save which were big saves during that period
3692659 im devastated to have not won that game we had the chances to win it three times over but if you dont take your chances that is what happens
3692660 ive got not dispute with the penalties i am very disappointed and to go out at this round is a disaster for us
3692661 we didnt play well in the first half in the second half there was only one team in it but the damage was done in the first half
3692662 i picked a side tonight to win the game but this has got to be put behind us
3692663 im really pleased with the way the whole team performed and some of the football we played was fantastic
3692664 i thought daniel parejo had already made himself a fans favourite with that performance
3692665 as expectativas do mercado de que a pr xima decis o ir ser a de um corte das taxas de juro s o prematuras
3692666 no que diz respeito crise o bce vai sacrificar o crescimento para combater a infla o
3692667 a velocidade do decl nio da infla o poder ainda decepcionar os mercados
3692668 dever o continuar a aumentar pelo menos por mais seis meses
3692669 algo que est em curso e indubitavelmente cria mais riscos
3692670 necessidade absoluta de evitar a materializa o de tais riscos
3692671 trichet n o pode dizer que vai combater a infla o e depois n o fazer nada
3692672 ainda existe a possibilidade de que o bce suba os juros e os mercados n o est o preparados para isso
3692673 we have made arsenal an offer which we feel is fair we are not negotiating and we are not falling out with arsenal if they dont accept the bid arsenal are a good club to deal with and we are both doing business the right way
3692674 if they accept the bid then great if not then we move on
3692675 we know that luke young must be replaced but we are not just looking for a right back with the sort of fee we received for young we must try to use it to improve the squad
3692676 we want to make one or two additions to the squad but we not major changes
3692677 unfortunately paul is still struggling and hasnt started full training yet he did some straight line running on monday but with an ankle injury thats not too much of a problem to do
3692678 its once you start changing direction and turning that the tendons and ligaments take more pressure on them i think its touch and go with him but well give paul every chance to prove his fitness ahead of the game
3692679 if he doesnt make it weve got titus bramble who came in and worked exceptionally hard in pre season
3692680 if we get a run in this competition which is our aim then playing thursday and then sunday will happen quite a bit for us this season
3692681 but that will be a mark of the progress weve made over the last couple of years our whole focus last year was to try and get into european football so we dont want to throw that away lightly
3692682 thats why i was very concerned about the odense fixture when you see rangers getting knocked out of the champions league having reached the uefa cup final just two months ago you realise how easily it can disappear from you
3692683 this is one of the biggest weeks of my time here at the club no doubt about it
3692684 we did make inquiries and i was more than confident but once you hear that a club of villas size are in for him big time you clearly fear the worst
3692685 of course its disappointing but there is no point dwelling on it we are out there not just looking but making serious attempts to bring new faces in

3692690 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party
3692691 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3692692 hes not a good man when it comes to everything else and he hasnt voted well in any way shape or form that would gain any support from me or any other thinking democrat
3692693 hagel couldnt keep his mouth shut long enough to be somebodys no 2
3692694 its just not responsible to be saying things like that

3692703 scheunemann and others on the foreign policy staff are involved in call requests and statements on foreign policy issues
3692704 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3692705 georgia has acted with restraint in its response and should continue to do so
3692706 are they really your own views or are they the views that are bought and paid for by the clients of your top aides mccain probably would be sympathetic to georgia regardless but having a guy like scheunemann as a top aide raises questions
3692707 its these sorts of appearances of a conflict of interest that are a natural consequence of having a campaign run by lobbyists staffed by lobbyists and being ensconced in a lobbyist culture for over a quarter of a century

3692740 a number of factors inimical to growth have intensified in 2008
3692741 expected losses from u s sub prime exposures have by now been mostly acknowledged it is too early to assess whether the worst of the turmoil and loss of asset values is behind us
3692742 there may be further setbacks in the months to come but broadly financial conditions are not likely to stabilize before early 2009
3692743 we are of course not immune to the challenging environment around us and the sustained weakness across financial markets put pressure on earnings
3692744 combined with lower real estate and private equity valuations lower investment results accounted for the vast majority of the profit decline
3692745 the good news was that the company reduced its equity exposure again proved resiliant in the credit crisis and the balance sheet remained strong

3692868 the exercise of estimating values and stating preferences can itself be revealing one of the difficulties with people ranney notes is that they position themselves in a relative sense you know theyre either pro immigration or anti immigration because if you think the immigration rate is 10 percent and you want it reduced to 8 percent youre anti immigration right but if your friend thinks its 1 percent and should go to 2 percent he thinks hes pro immigration even though hes advocating a rate thats four times lower than what youre advocating in fact ranney says the real immigration rate is just 0 4 percent

3692876 percept picture company has been always recognized for producing thoughtful films with the screening of two indian films at toronto international film festival indian talent will get an international platform to scatter their light all around the world we are delighted with our association with an extremely talented actor and now a director nandita das this is a grand opportunity for us to get in touch with the worldwide audience
3692877 firaaq has five different stories that are at times interconnected and at times discrete the characters are across class gender age and community that represent a cross section of society the film is an aftermath story so there is hardly any violence in the film but a lot of tension and fear that surrounds the people

3692879 from our research and understanding of it we learnt that there is an unmet demand for bhojpuri content across the bhojpuri population which led to the creation of mahuaa tv it is the first offering from our stable as we intend to launch of a bouquet of other channels like bhojpuri news bhojpuri music and bhojpuri film channels shortly to cover the entire gambit of offering for our viewers
3692880 we have already spent close to rs 10 crores towards marketing to ensure maximum visibility for the newly launched channel mmpl has a full fledged set up with over 150 people currently working exclusively on the mahuaa channel bhojpuri is currently a high growth regional market with total regional markets accounting for more than 24 of the total television advertising pie as a first mover mahuaa tv will enjoy the advantages like advertising revenues and creating a strong brand image
3692881 bhojpuri movies have done extremely well over the past few years and is a huge industry today mahuaa tv will definitely help to take it to the next level by giving it a medium to reach the masses across the globe and also attract the huge pool of untapped talent
3692882 mahuaa tv is a great commitment from mmpl to compliment the voracious bhojpuri talent and entertainment that did not have a medium to showcase itself with stalwarts like prakash jha producing shows for mahuaa tv its sure to be an instant hit throughout the country

3693103 ren du bist am n rburgring siebter geworden nachdem du mit deinem meisterschafts kontrahenten chris mamerow kollidiert bist ist die sache f r dich abgehakt
3693104 ja ich denke schon das war an dem wochenende sicherlich ein bisschen bitter aber in endeffekt ist es f r mich ja noch besser gelaufen als ich gedacht h tte wenn er gewonnen h tte und ich zweiter geworden w re dann h tte ich jetzt nicht diesen abstand
3693105 der liegt jetzt bei zw lf punkten auf mamerow und 13 z hler vorsprung hast du auf jan seyffarth bei noch zwei ausstehenden rennwochenenden wie sicher f hlst du dich
3693106 sicher noch gar nicht ich gucke immer von rennen und zu rennen und sehe dass ich die f hrung nach jedem lauf weiterhin habe es kann so viel passieren wenn ich mir einen ausfall leiste dann sieht die geschichte schon wieder ganz anders aus ich habe ein kleines polster was ich auch behalten will aber deswegen ist das thema noch lange nicht gegessen ich werde versuchen in den n chsten zwei rennen kein risiko einzugehen und punkte einzufahren ich glaube zwei mal ein dritter platz w rde mir reichen dann w rde ich die meisterschaft gewinnen auch wenn chris die beiden l ufe gewinnt aber sicher bin ich auf keinen fall
3693107 ich werde versuchen in den n chsten zwei rennen kein risiko einzugehen und punkte einzufahren
3693108 im porsche carrera cup geht es so eng zu kann man da wirklich auf sicherheit fahren
3693109 man kann nur versuchen sich aus rangeleien herauszuhalten wenn man von hinten abgeschossen wird dann ist das schicksal so eine aktion wie mit chris am n rburgring die werde ich nat rlich versuchen zu vermeiden dabei kann mal ganz schnell ein k hler zum beispiel kaputt gehen ich habe jetzt nicht den druck dass ich das rennen unbedingt gewinnen muss daher kann ich mich etwas zur ckhalten und kann chris und seyffarth wenigstens in einem rennen mal fahren lassen
3693110 eine hnliche situation kennst du schon aus deiner zeit im seat leon supercopa damals in hockenheim ging es nicht so gut aus
3693111 genau das ging echt nicht so gut aus und war wirklich hnlich da hatte ich auch einige punkte vorsprung und h tte eigentlich auch nur zwei rennen noch durchfahren m ssen egal auf welchem platz aber im letzten rennen wurde ich dann ungl cklich abgeschossen das war keine mutwillige aktion sondern einfach nur ein rennunfall der hinter mir passiert ist da wurde ich unfreiwillig abger umt sozusagen dadurch bin ich dann ausgefallen und kein meister geworden da kann man nichts machen mit solch einer situation muss man jetzt auch wieder rechnen wo man nichts daf r kann ich sage erst das ich meister bin wenn ich das letzte rennen beendet habe und dann auch noch vorne bin
3693112 diese konstanz hat mich in der tabelle auf den ersten platz gebracht
3693113 die zw lf punkte vorsprung hast du erst einmal noch und die kommen ja nicht von ungef hr was macht dich so stark wo bist du besser als die gegner
3693114 das kann man kaum sagen es geht st ndig hin und her wir sind vorne fast alle auf dem selben niveau das nimmt sich alles nicht viel ich habe vielleicht ein bisschen mehr konstanz in der sache ich bin ein mal sechster geworden und jetzt siebter am n rburgring das waren die schlechtesten ergebnisse bei normalem rennverlauf war ich immer in der lage unter die ersten drei zu fahren das war bei den anderen halt nicht sie waren vielleicht auch in der lage dazu haben es dann aber nicht so umgesetzt ich war immer vorne dabei ein mal erster drei mal zweiter ein mal dritter ich stand bei sieben rennen jetzt f nf mal auf dem podium diese konstanz hat mich in der tabelle auf den ersten platz gebracht
3693115 du hast in den vergangenen jahren einen steten aufstieg hingelegt 2005 hast du den polo cup gewonnen warst dann im seat leon sehr stark und nun im porsche das sind drei v llig unterschiedliche fahrzeuge gewichtsverteilung leistung schaltung reifen und sogar antriebsachse alles ist anders wie schaffst du diese umstellungen
3693116 ich wei es auch nicht so genau der polo und der seat waren noch einigerma en gleich da musste man sich nicht so sehr umstellen wobei 150 ps zu dann 300 ps schon ein sprung waren der sprung von seat zu porsche war schon enorm man muss sich die jungs anschauen die erfahrung haben und genau beobachten was die machen das muss man dann reflektieren und dann genau das machen was die auch machen dann gew hnt man sich mit den tests und den kilometern einen fahrstil an
3693117 man muss das ganze prinzip verstehen dann klappt das fast von alleine
3693118 es ist nicht einfach aber wenn man ein bisschen k pfchen hat und ein nachdenkt und das auto verstehen lernt sowie die erfahrungen der anderen fahrer mit einflie en l sst dann ist es eigentlich gar nicht so schwierig man muss das ganze prinzip verstehen dann klappt das fast von alleine
3693119 du bist von der meisterschaft jetzt nicht mehr weit entfernt also darf man schon einmal weiterdenken wo soll es danach hingehen
3693120 das ist schwer zu sagen da habe ich noch gar nicht wirklich dar ber nachgedacht klar man spielt schon mal mit dem gedanken wo es hingehen k nnte ich habe noch keine richtige wunschvorstellung aber nat rlich w re dtm ein riesending f r mich w rde ich gerne fahren ich w rde jetzt nichts ausschlie en wollen tourenwagen weltmeisterschaft oder als werksfahrer f r irgendein werk zu fahren w re eine alternative das w rde ich auch gerne machen ich werde das auf mich zukommen lassen mal sehen ob jemand ein angebot f r mich hat wenn ich dann mit dem angebot zufrieden bin werde ich es nat rlich annehmen und versuchen das beste daraus zu machen aber eine konkrete richtung dass ich zum beispiel sage ich will nur dtm fahren habe ich nicht
3693121 nat rlich w re dtm ein riesending f r mich w rde ich gerne fahren
3693122 bist du bei porsche fest verankert oder noch bei vw im boot die dann indirekt mit audi auch zum beispiel in den le mans serien vertreten sind
3693123 ich bin sozusagen vw junior werksfahrer da ich den polo cup gewonnen habe werde ich seitdem von vw unterst tzt ich wurde ja auch schon beim 24 stunden rennen von vw eingesetzt aber direkte kontakte zu audi habe ich jetzt noch nicht aber vielleicht k nnte das durch diese verbindung entstehen das w re auch nicht das schlechteste
3693124 die pause bis zum n chsten porsche carrera cup rennen in barcelona ist sehr lang jetzt noch ber einen monat was machst du in der zeit
3693125 das n chste porsche supercup rennen ist in valencia ja schon am bern chsten wochenende wir machen jetzt drei tage lang eine fitness berpr fung im rahmen der speed academy ich habe in den wochen ein bisschen programm und versuche mich nebenbei auch mit viel sport fit zu halten jetzt kommt aber am wochenende endlich mal eine zeit wo ich mal ausspannen und erholen kann das ist auch mal nicht schlecht
3693126 is weve demonstrated proof of practice for all the target objectives in three years
3693127 one advantage of transgenics is that its fast when it works
3693128 so we can get a product in one year with breeding it takes many generations as many as 10 possibly
3693129 we have at least three traits in the field and we anticipate having two and maybe more coming by the end of the year
3693130 africa is in the process of establishing biosafety regulations for transgenics in most of the countries sayre said four or five countries including kenya and nigeria have rules in place he added and two have transgenics in commercial production
3693131 when all these traits get stacked into what will be a farmer preferred cultivar from africa this work will be done by african scientists in african laboratories were developing the tools mostly in the united states and europe but once those tools are in place it becomes an african owned and developed project

3693155 die hygienestandards der toilette die ich nach langer suche gefunden hatte lie en zu w nschen brig aus diesem erlebnis ist dann die idee entstanden eine toilettensuchmaschine mit bewertungssystem zu erfinden
3693156 mein kumpel christian rohowski und ich haben vor dem start von lootogo de ungef hr hundert toiletten selbst getestet
3693157 mit der zeit entwickelt man einen kennerblick f r hochwertige wcs immer wenn ich irgendwo unterwegs bin halte ich ausschau nach toiletten und benutze sie auch gleich damit ich sie bewerten kann

3693161 the video was shot in an evening in a makeshift greenscreen studio in the manchester evening news arena on kylies day off between performing the concept behind the video was inspired by some initial images which kylie emailed me man ray rodchenko images of carol lombard and lauren bacall
3693162 its also influenced by fritz lang art deco powell and pressburger the wizard of oz and busby berkeley
3693163 since leaving colonel blimp earlier this year i was lucky enough to get the job of working on tour visuals for kylie as well as for various other artists including paul mccartney and mika
3693164 its great fun working with someone as iconic as kylie she looks great against any colour scheme
3693165 what i see in nature is a magnificent structure that we can comprehend only very imperfectly and that must fill a thinking person with a feeling of humility

3693210 i talked to matt earlier he certainly felt a lot better than he did last night he felt significantly better about the whole thing so well see
3693211 probably not significantly more a little more a lot of it of course will depend on the health of people
3693212 whats interesting about web 2 0 is that it gives you access to markets a small business owner couldnt normally reach
3693213 in the 17 years ive been breeding dogs ive never been as far as i am now with my business since building the blog site
3693214 now ive got waiting lists for puppies in fact as soon as the blog was up i started getting calls
3693215 any small business owner can use a blog as an online marketing tool but its more effective to combine it with google adwords to drive traffic a lot of professionals such as massage therapists and restaurateurs are also combining google adwords with online scheduling services and seeing an enormous increase in revenues
3693216 its easy to start a blog but its another to create an environment thats engaging enough to be an impactful part of your business
3693217 your efforts must be driven by core business needs and tightly aligning them with specific tactics
3693218 theyve taken the drivers seat by becoming the early adopters
3693219 thats because web 2 0 enables them to achieve a scale at an affordable price which was never possible before
3693220 if you can identify and reach out to influencers on a one on one basis it can be very fruitful with 100 million consumers actively reaching blogs businesses need to know the right place to get to the right audience with the right message at the right time
3693221 once youve done your flight planning then you can start doing outreach
3693222 there are a gazillion sites out there so you need to find your audience for a small business where you have to wear many hats its helpful to have a way to find the major influencers and prioritize your marketing it helps you gauge what people are talking about who is talking and what you need to watch out for
3693223 virtual merchandise just gives you a different way to connect with consumers and pilot new merchandise without having to go to the expense of making real goods
3693224 in the true smal business fashion we dont have funds we wanted to reach our demographic so we have to look to non traditional media channels
3693225 we saw there com as a very interesting social test to see what kind of reaction we would get to our new designs and over two years wed only have to sell 20 to 30 t shirts for the investment to pay for itself weve definitely hit that number already
3693226 you can tap into customers you can compete and innovate efficiently and effectively you can integrate blogs forums wikis and rss really simple syndication feeds to support activities that are unique to your products and ideas

3693256 there are 21 farm states and thats 42 senators theyre going to have ethanol
3693257 come on bob you spend more money making it than importing it
3693258 so despite what you may have read recently about food versus fuel hype the evidence on the ground in the magic valley is that we can efficiently produce both f
3693259 is it logical or even acceptable that agricultural crops are used to produce ethanol
3693260 is it logical or even acceptable that agricultural crops are used to produce ethanol leading to a worse crisis in food prices

3693294 new build apartments throughout the uk were traditionally sold to buy to let investors who were competing with first time buyers
3693295 but the market has changed since the autumn the buy to let investors have disappeared
3693296 i think its likely we will see further falls in prices which is not necessarily a bad thing
3693297 there are lots of overpriced properties on the market here in other provincial towns across the country
3693298 a lot of people bought them as buy to lets but the market has changed and people are suddenly realising that what was supposed to be the goose that laid the golden egg is not the case
3693299 some people have decided to reduce prices to create interest with reductions of 10 000 here and 20 000 there but everybody is finding that times are rather hard
3693300 the reduction in the starting price of these luxury apartments means now is the time to pick up an exceptional property for an exceptional price
3693301 united breweries limiteds ubl top line registered a strong growth of 26 5 yoy to rs 4 7 billion however ebitda margin dropped by whopping 6 3 yoy to 13 5 due to high advertisement costs
3693302 the stock has appreciated by 36 7 from our last quarterly update and at the current market price of rs 180 it trades at a high forward p e of 96 1x for fy09e besides our dcf valuation gives a fair value of rs 141 therefore we believe that the stocks valuation is stretched we downgrade our rating to sell

3693307 we zijn bezorgd we vinden de vele controles bij ons team ongewoon
3693308 er wordt veel bloed getrokken bij de controles dit is geen protest maar we vinden het toch wat abnormaal
3693309 met 50 000 kiezers levert halle vilvoorde de mr twee zetels op bij een splitsing moet er een compensatie gevonden worden voor reynders
3693310 het is abnormaal dat de 60 000 vlaamse kiezers 17 zetels en de helft van de ministers waard zijn in het brussels gewest dat is antidemocratisch
3693311 een brussels ministerschap is voor de vlamingen een job voor het leven kijk naar jos chabert die was 27 jaar brussels minister laten we daarover discussi ren
3693312 het lijkt me opportuun om de federale verkiezingen nu te organiseren in plaats van in 2011 dagelijks bewijst leterme dat hij onbekwaam is hij weet dat de peilingen voor hem niet gunstig zijn leterme is een opportunist die wil weten hoe hij zich moet gedragen om de regionale verkiezingen van 2009 te winnen

3693315 he was running for president and had he won the nomination imagine what that would have done
3693316 we had to cover it because the newspaper that brought you woman gives birth to four headed reptile

3693320 although organizations and churches have been among the earliest adopters of emerging media opportunities they continue to seek new methods to increase member retention engagement outreach and membership growth
3693321 with our ministry division we have assembled a team with technical as well as clerical experience to answer the need
3693322 our team not only understands the technical aspects of providing online initiatives but also the unique needs of faith communities worldwide
3693323 digital media can be a valuable tool in maximizing the ability to have kingdom impact and enhance the churchs assets of people and abilities
3693324 reaching citizens of remote countries or the young people in our own parishes all are challenges of the church today
3693325 i think i am also very convinced technically banking is a sector to stay in and even if you are looking at this from a slightly longer perspective i think both on short term as well as long term counts one should stay in the sector we particularly like axis bank closer to these rs 700 levels i think its an opportunity finally i see the stock moving to even rs 840 850 levels so even if you look at state bank of india sbi or icici bank i still think there is some momentum which is going to possibly develop here the volume cues are very interesting here so keeping all this in mind i think it would rate as one of the better sectors to be in now
3693326 corporation banks operating profit grew by a healthy 16 5 yoy in q109 however net profit grew by merely 4 1 primarily due to mtm losses suffered during the quarter we have valued the standalone bank by using the three stage decf model our target price of rs 335 is 21 more than the current market price thus we reaffirm our buy rating

3693329 overall the inflation report appears to be on the dovish side and significantly reduces fears that interest rates could rise in the near term in reaction to the sharp rise in inflation
3693330 indeed the report suggests that interest rates are likely to fall modestly further out
3693331 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3693332 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3693333 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3693334 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3693335 looks like john edwards shes got his eyes and jaw line and lips
3693336 the most shocking thing was watching him on tv last week giving these half truths these half baked answers i wish for everyone involved that hed have come clean
3693337 shes still protecting john because she loves him and thinks they may eventually have a future together
3693338 il cuore ha delle ragioni che la ragione non conosce
3693339 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
3693340 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
3693341 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is in a state of total military aggression
3693342 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
3693343 we are actually in the stage of preparing our departure
3693344 we are waiting for the green light from tbilisi to leave iraq today tomorrow or the day after tomorrow
3693345 our peacekeepeers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
3693346 they are also responsible for protecting the population thats what we are doing now
3693347 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3693348 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3693349 the irish times south ossetia is a territory of around 4 000sq km 1 544sq mls situated about 100km north of the georgian capital tbilisi on the southern slopes of the caucasus mountains
3693350 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
3693351 but we have a provisional cessation of hostilities and everyone should be aware that this is considerable progress
3693352 there is no way in good conscience that we could proceed with a joint naval exercise given the state of this crisis
3693353 for decision makers in the nato countries of the west it would be worth considering whether in future you want the men and women of your armed services to be answerable to mr saakashvilis declarations of war in the caucasus
3693354 a higher race subjects to itself a lower race a right which we see in nature and which can be regarded as the sole conceivable right
3693355 gentlemen is there not a law which is above our laws
3693356 that graph is false because in medieval europe you were a catholic christian or you werent any other sort of christian
3693357 that quote came from a catholic who admitted to it
3693358 fine who was the person who admitted to this then
3693359 were it not that the baptists have been grievously tormented and cut off with the knife during the past twelve hundred years they would swarm in greater number than all of the reformers
3693360 the social democrats fiercely opposed the enabling act hitler needed a 2 3 majority so the balance lay with zentrum the catholic center party zentrum leader monsignor ludwig kaas a close friend and advisor to eugenio pacelli the future pope pius xii addressed the reichstag far from attacking the enabling act or disputing hitlers claim that nazism was based on christianity kaas called for a yes vote the zentrum faction did vote yes and the act became law according to national catholic reporter correspondent john allen a liberal catholic and student of vatican history
3693361 the tasmanians a portion of the australians and a mountain tribe in china
3693362 considerable numbers of the mixed lemuro atlantean peoples produced by various crossings with such semi human stocks e g the wild men of borneo the veddhas of ceylon classed by prof flower among aryans most of the remaining australians bushmen negritos andaman islanders etc
3693363 exactly right micro change of a bacterium to overcome a hostile environment but when the threat subsides the evolution bactirium resorts back to its former self no gross change for anyone who buys the line of evolution crap please explain the human eyeball if this was covered please to show me where
3693364 science does not include evolution until it is proven so it is you inventing science and it wont be proven ever because it didnt happen
3693365 it does not stand up to peer review by the majority of the scientific community
3693366 all scientist and sources will be used not just marxist darwinian brainwashing material the majority of academia in the evolution camp only proves there is a new world order darwin rose with marxism
3693367 there are many debates on youtube and google go check them out and see
3693368 all youve done is to deny and plead ignorance of polystrates and the chalk layers and not followed any of the links the one link shows fossils are formed in months not millions of years
3693369 the most deadly of all religions is pagans out of rome that did create this marxist secular human atheism
3693370 i point this out for a couple reasons but the main is that there is a marxist nwo political agenda pushing evolution in the schools and controlled media
3693371 george bush is neither creationist nor christian but belongs to the order of death and other pagan secret societies sun religions who btw believe in evolution further bush oversees the education system if he disagreed with evolution and atheism he could have ended it but atheist are a tool of the globalist see nazis the globalist marxist have no intention of ending their indoctrination system
3693372 the jesuits took russia with the russian revolution the russian orthodox is as pagan as the vatican and the jesuits which teach evolution these jesuits started marxism and are the main propagators of it today
3693373 if i had followed the links i would have found a
3693374 youve neither debunked nor provided any support for a million billion year old anything ill ask again prove something anything
3693375 as we see fossils do happen rapidly when creatures die they decay and are scavenged the only way to get a fossil without decay is with flood sediment volcanic ect and in the case of delicate structure creatures jellyfish rapid flood sediment deposition that have captured every minute detail these are found globally at geolayers claimed to all be the same age cambrian the only way to arrive at our fossil record is a global flood
3693376 but really you are the one making a claim of a million year old fossil with no proof
3693377 that is what is assumed they do move slowly most of the time but have been observed to raise quickly as with new island formations and mtns show evidences too have risen rapidly too
3693378 the mid atlantic ridge shows deep sediment walls and is theorized to have shelf slid where they are today forming parallel mtns this theory popular with many scientist explains mtns and oceans much better than un uniformitarian theory
3693379 the water only became saline with continent runoff erosion the fish adapted just as the other animals di many died
3693380 the chalk layer was not my quote but comes from
3693381 until we see these alleged fossils filling the textbooks they are more of the deception so often found
3693382 you have not explained away either the missing geocolumn erosion nonconformities or the polystrates fossils found all over the planet claiming they are few to local floods
3693383 again we need to see the real fossil not a drawing of an alleged fossil not a plaster cast a child can tell the difference i dont need anyone to tell me what to think i can look at how a building falls and tell somethings not right with some of these so called experts
3693384 there is only one museum that i know of that exhibits fakes and that is the creation museum such as what fakes
3693385 those are needed appendages that have always been that way and will always be there the whales snakes and others with hind claws use them for mating they wouldnt be able to breed without it fabricating fully formed legs as found in the museum and in textbooks is not science but pagan fantasy religion whales have always been whales snakes have always been snakes and dinosaurs did not evolve into any chicken a chicken has always been a chicken
3693386 there is lacking fossils to support any of this including whale legs
3693387 mt st helens is light years from the grand canyon in physical make up the former generated igneous rock and volcanic ash not a sedimentary rock in sight the grand canyon on the other hand is sedimentary layers sandstones limestones etc
3693388 there were still polystrate trees showing how they form and that trees stripped of bark and limbs are known to have been in a flood
3693389 at mount st helens both unfossilized and partially fossilized polystrate trees were observed in many outcrops of volcanic debris and mud flows lahars and pyroclastic flow deposits along the south toutle and other rivers
3693390 wide genetic variation is not evolution the fish are still fish the virus is still a virus natural selection is not evolution only preserves the best of the kind adaptation is built into genetics it is not evolution but is reversible
3693391 try as scientist may they have not been able to get a fruit fly to evolve not even a beneficail mutation
3693392 dont need any of your qualifications to watch a dirt model
3693393 you agree through your use of this forum that you will not post any material which is false defamatory inaccurate
3693394 carbon dating of magmatic rocks shows the earth to be circa 4 5 billion years old
3693395 carbon dating of magmatic rocks shows the earth to be circa 4 5 billion years old
3693396 mtnls wireline customers decreased by 1 5 qoq to 3 75 million despite the bundling of services the company is unable to stem the drop in arpu and loss in subscribers consequently wireline revenue dropped 3 2 qoq to rs 7 6 million
3693397 based on our dcf valuation we arrive at a target price of rs 86 for the stock hence we reiterate our sell rating on the stock based on constant unsatisfactory operating performance
3693398 more than 10 000 service men and women have been discharged on the basis of sexual orientation since the dont ask dont tell policy was implemented at a cost of over 360 million
3693399 i think a lot of these so called hot button social issues are not going to carry much sway this year
3693400 i think more people are interested in the economy and their jobs how we are going to get affordable accessible healthcare
3693401 they are interested in making sure their kids can go to college without having a mountain of debt piled on their heads
3693402 they want to make sure we have an education for our kids and they want to make sure we protect the environment for future generations
3693403 they care about the economic issues and the health care issues and getting out of iraq
3693404 these override all these so called hot button issues i dont think they are going to count for much at all
3693405 here we are with the democratic national party conducting an assault directly on marriage that throws out everything we have known in 6 000 years of history
3693406 i dont think they the people of iowa really believe it yet they dont take it seriously they dont understand the depth of mobilization they wont believe it will happen
3693407 when the people of iowa see pictures of same sex couples kissing on the steps of their churches they will mobilize
3693408 we will enact a comprehensive bipartisan employment non discrimination act
3693409 we oppose the defense of marriage act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us
3693410 the public acts records and judicial proceedings of every other state
3693411 taken to the soiled utility room and left alone to die
3693412 clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade
3693413 construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any
3693414 most or all of microsofts client side applications are affected or patched
3693415 this is the largest update in 2008 and the largest in the last 18 months we have two that we know have been exploited and four zero days
3693416 the bulletin has been removed prior to todays bulletin release because of a last minute quality issue
3693417 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3693418 the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them
3693419 we will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous georgian aggression
3693420 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3693421 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3693422 there are a few things that need to be discussed to get a full ceasefire
3693423 the russians are saying that they will never again accept georgians in any form in south ossetia they see them as a trojan horse that started the attacks last week
3693424 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3693425 abkhazia and ossetia if i mention territorial integrity are to the best of my knowledge part of georgia
3693426 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict
3693427 require the signing of a legally binding treaty on the non use of force
3693428 why are people waving flags its not as if we won
3693429 i wonder why he did it he has only 10 000 soldiers and he takes on russia
3693430 this is going to be one of those situations where people are saying i dont like that but i do like this
3693431 if speaker pelosi is truly sincere about having a vote on deep ocean oil and gas drilling to help bring down fuel costs she should use her power as speaker to call congress back into session immediately and schedule a vote on the american energy act
3693432 we are asking that she bring our american energy act up for a vote
3693433 if she brings it up under regular order then amendments will be allowed and well have that debated what we want is a chance to have that debate and have a vote
3693434 my goggles pretty much filled up with water it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing to be honest but its fine i wanted to break the record i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3693435 hes a great athlete he helped pull me to my goal
3693436 i was able to catch up to him more than i expected
3693437 imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3693438 born in the middle of america to the middle class in the middle of the last century and talk about the basic bargain as about the deeply american values you grew up with learned as a child and that drive you today values of fairness compassion responsibility giving back
3693439 if you believe that serious issues need to be raised then we have to raise them without continual hesitation and we should be pushing the envelope
3693440 wont a single tape of the reverend jeremiah wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender many people peter hart excluded believe under the surface that 20 years sitting there with goddamn america would make him unelectable by itself
3693441 if youre a bad guy and you try to get between me and the safety and lives of american citizens youre going to lose
3693442 for me it is a logical progression to go from serving ones country in the armed serves to serving ones country in a different uniform a civilian suit
3693443 because you have taken an oath to the constitution and you know what it means to sacrifice for the country and you believe in something that is bigger than yourself
3693444 weve got to get back to the basic conservative principles
3693445 understanding our national security fiscal conservatism social conservatism and tying ourselves to what it is in the constitution
3693446 if its about the lives of my men and their safety id go through hell with a gasoline can
3693447 to make sure we are setting up our soldiers and airman and marines for success on the ground instead of having them in these situations where they can be exploited by the enemy
3693448 they are in a quandary about who they are and what they want to be as opposed to what we saw in 1994 when they took over with the contract with america
3693449 as long as you are blocking and tackling you win but when you start getting to the point where youre shifting and changing your positions too often people start to lose confidence in you
3693450 because i stay on the same basic themes same basic message
3693451 we have to go to the issues and talk about the basic conservative principles which promote individual rights and freedom individual responsibility and accountability of american citizens and i think thats where you win
3693452 its the same as saying world war ii was about fighting blitzkrieg
3693453 weve got to define this enemy and be very clear about understanding its goals and objectives
3693454 when you have groups that are unindicted co conspirators in terrorist activities that should alarm you
3693455 when you have such propaganda that is going through mosques all through this country when you have people that are talking against our constitution and our constitutional democracy and way of life thats got to cause you some nervousness
3693456 its about promulgating a different political system that is contrary to what we have here which is individual rights and freedoms and respect thereof
3693457 weve got to deny the enemy sanctuary wherever he seeks to establish his terrorist activities and training camps
3693458 weve got to interdict the flow of his men and materiel and financial support weve got to isolate and we have to contain his ideology not allow it to spread and confront our way of life and then the last thing is we have to disrupt his worldwide operations
3693459 that advantage does not translate into anything other than the fact that he can put a bad message out on tv more than me right now
3693460 all that congressman klein can do is to regurgitate nancy pelosis talking points
3693461 he cannot come up with any type of sound solution on his own he has to stay within the democratic agenda which as we see right now is nothing but more attacks and spin doubling the capital gains tax increasing the estate tax increasing the payroll tax on people earning 200 000 or more not coming up with any solution for our energy situation
3693462 what happened in 2006 is the combination of republicans acting more like democrats not being fiscally conservative and not holding up to their standards
3693463 not beholden to a lot of standards so they will do certain things and theyll say so what
3693464 heres someone caught with 90 000 in marked bills in the freezer and hes still a congressman hes in a leadership position hes going to run for office again
3693465 the american people are looking for conservatives to be people of standards and principles and to hold to them
3693466 every time you were promoted as an officer you re took your oath to the constitution because thats what you were there to support and defend
3693467 the constitution is the embodiment of the american people so as long as you understand that you are a servant to the american people as long as you understand that basic document and what it is calling you to do you wont change
3693468 enoch approached his sleeping brother and stabbed him three times with the weapon each time in the heart or as close as he could come to it
3693469 get him out of here he killed his brother get him out of here
3693470 interest rate sensitive sectors are going to be more sideways i dont really see major downsides happening here so i would kind of stay away from this pack i dont see any major move coming in here i would say largely they are going to be rangebound just like we have seen in the last couple of days in the market hardly moving up or down 50 80 points so it is a tough call to take here at these levels for all these stocks so i am going to stay away from them this is what could really give some shape on the upside for the market keep in mind that 4 420 4 450 thats the zone if we are above that i think we are in a trajectory where we need to consolidate and then move up
3693471 serious and broad allegation that members of congress congressional staff and other officials were given preferential treatment needs to be investigated
3693472 because the issues you raise would require the oversight and government reform committee to investigate the conduct of members
3693473 i got a call that if i want the tickets i have to volunteer two shifts of three hours apiece for one ticket if i want two tickets then its four shifts of two hours apiece
3693474 i received a call monday saying i could qualify for the tickets if i do 12 hours of volunteer work for the obama campaign between now and friday the 15th
3693475 to work 40 hours at my job get to and from work get to and from the campaign office and complete the 12 hours in three days would be next to impossible
3693476 theyre trying desperately i mean theyre almost panic stricken they want tickets to hear his acceptance speech
3693477 i put my name in im keeping my fingers crossed
3693478 i mean they made it seem like any coloradan could go and now you have to work for your ticket
3693479 if theres one public official who has consistently put his country ahead of his party working across party lines to get things done in washington it is john mccain
3693480 sen obama has no record that i can see of taking on positions that are held by a lot of people within his own party
3693481 john mccain does that all the time its part of the reason it took some while for a lot of republicans to come to his side sen mccain has worked across party lines on the big issues of our time because he knows he has no patience for partisan politics and all those games
3693482 my accreditation was in my pocket but they wouldnt let me get it out to show them
3693483 i could see that they threw in behind me a yellow tibetan flag or banner i couldnt see exactly what it was
3693484 they are claiming i tried to unfurl a tibet banner i did not at any time try to unfurl a banner and i have never possessed any banner or protest material i was there simply to report on a demonstration not to take part in it in any way
3693485 chinese people are great but shame on the chinese government because they are lying to china
3693486 chinese people have a right to be chinese why cant tibetans have the right to be tibetan china is illegally occupying my country we are proud to be tibetan we will never give up this is a non violent war

3693613 open thy hand wide unto thy brother to the poor and needy
3693614 if a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food and one of you says to them
3693615 for the needy shall not always be forgotten the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever
3693616 if there is among you a poor man of your brethren within any of the gates in your land which the lord your god is giving you you shall not harden your heart nor shut your hand from your poor brother but you shall open you hand wide to him and willingly lend him sufficient for his need whatever he needs
3693617 and if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive what thanks is it to you for even sinners lend to sinners that they may receive the like but love your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing in return and your reward shall be great and you shall be sons of the highest

3693709 instead of two to three days of hospitalization and two months of recuperation typical with open prostate surgery robotic surgery patients often go home the next day and resume normal activities within two weeks

3693711 these surgeries result in fewer immediate complications and quicker recovery than in an open procedure especially in the hands of a skilled surgeon who performs a high volume of cases routinely

3693798 well i am priya is coffee alright and some sandwiches
3693799 gosh we were so upset this morning that we never thought that
3693800 was that the letter from your aunt that had upset you so much this morning was the letter about meeting your prospective groom a total stranger
3693801 by the way madam why are you all dressed in black
3693802 the same place as the hair on your moustache mister
3693803 you know this morning when i had advised you to chop off your hair and to wear black as a deterrent to the prospective groom i didnt know that that i was the unfortunate fellow
3693804 i didnt know i was the prospective bride either when i suggested chopping off your moustache in the charlie chaplin style and what about the oily hair thats quite some thinking on your part thats the perfect touch
3693805 frankly this morning when we had our brief talk neither of us wanted to face complete strangers let alone get married
3693806 and we thought we were sharing our problems with complete stranger too
3693807 you know maybe our chance encounter brought us together or maybe it was fate
3693808 whatever but you know we are still together only because of that

3693837 visitors are like fish after 3 days they go bad
3693838 we are living in an orwellian world where the russian federation accuses georgia of genocide and ethnic cleansing and meanwhile they are doing it exactly right now there was a temporary ceasefire that was the understanding from this morning there is large scale movement of russian weapons of shooting of armed incidents rampages through different towns and villages of georgia russian troops are in the process of completing ethnic cleansing of all georgian populated areas of abkhazia and south ossetia
3693839 the armed forces of the russian federation which were sent to south ossetia to reinforce our peacekeeping forces they will be withdrawn to russian territory depending on the extent to which the georgian troops go back to their barracks our peacekeepers will remain in south ossetia
3693840 the only change relates to the fact that georgian peacekeepers who were part of the peacekeeping contingent but turned out to be simply traitors and cowards and started shooting at their colleagues of course they are never again going to appear as part of a peacekeeping contingent in south ossetia
3693841 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3693842 the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt
3693843 we are working with an international community but all we got so far are just words statements moral support humanitarian aid but we need more we want them to stop this barbaric aggressor
3693844 as you know the enclaves of south ossetia previously controlled by the georgian government and by local administration headed by ethnic ossetian dimitri sanakoev has been ethnically cleansed by intruding russian troops and i get very worrying reports some of them look to be unfortunately credible of point blank executions on sight killings some people taken into some kind of camps or some internal places in kurta and vladikavkaz
3693845 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganised
3693846 you know the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them so you have to use surgery as for claims by the georgian president that the ceasefire has been observed for two days thats a lie georgian forces continued to fire at peacekeepers unfortunately people were killed yesterday there was no ceasefire from the georgian side
3693847 we dont yet have peace but we have a provisional cessation of hostilities and everyone should be aware that this is considerable progress
3693848 we want to see the russians stand down what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3693849 russias actions amount to the pre planned cold blooded murder of a country
3693850 they the americans of course had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shia villages but the current georgian rulers who in one hour simply wiped 10 ossetian villages from the face of the earth the georgian rulers which used tanks to run over children and the elderly which threw civilians into cellars and burnt them they georgian leaders are players that have to be protected
3693851 the ferocity in which the actions of the georgian side were carried out cannot be called anything else but genocide because they acquired a mass character and were directed against individuals the civilian population peacekeepers who carried out their functions of maintaining peace
3693852 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3693853 we are really seeing absolutely unparalleled situation since many many decades in the world this is the most surreal world crisis i could ever imagine and its very unfortunate that it is happening in my country i insist that its happening unprovoked by us and i insist that it was all pre planned
3693854 regime change is purely an american invention purely an american invention we never apply this terminology in our political thinking and certainly we are all for democracy in georgia and its interesting that our american colleagues chose to bring up publicly this idea of president saakashvili stepping down
3693855 this is 100 unprovoked brutal russian invasion this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders we on our own cannot fight with russia we want an immediate ceasefire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
3693856 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
3693857 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
3693858 im deeply concerned about the situation in georgia the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
3693859 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
3693860 uncontrolled vocabulary 9 on the level of what einstein did
3693861 the swedish chairmanship of the committee of ministers is convinced that sustainable peace and stability are based on respect for human rights democracy and the rule of law
3693862 i urge the russian federation georgia and the separatist south ossetian and abkhaz administrations to immediately enter into a cease fire in order to stop hostilities i call upon the parties to agree to direct talks and to cooperate in international efforts to achieve a cease fire the suffering of the civilian population must be brought to an immediate end
3693863 the way in which the situation in south ossetia has deteriorated is cause for profound concern it is extremely important that all those involved show restraint and play their part in bringing about a political solution
3693864 todays military coup in mauritania is a serious setback for a country which has successfully established a functioning democratic system after a long period of authoritarian rule
3693865 alexander solzhenitsyn was undoubtedly one of the great authors of our time and a central figure in the story of russias tragic 20th century like no one else he could capture in his books the reality of the stalinist hell that was the soviet union in the books one day in the life of ivan denisovich the first circle and the gulag archipelago he created some of the truly great works of contemporary history and literature on a day like this we have reason to remember him and the great work he did for his russia
3693866 after the collapse of the wto talks yesterday the parties to the talks must take their responsibility and think about how the doha round can be moved forward both us chief negotiator susan schwab and wto director general pascal lamy have said that despite everything the doha round is still alive the hope is to be able to resume negotiations in the near future

3694015 we never launched coverage in those countries because we simply werent satisfied with the map data we had available
3694016 were constantly searching for the best map data we can find and sometimes will delay launching coverage in a country if we think we can get more comprehensive data
3694017 were hearing from our users that they would rather see even very basic coverage of a country than see nothing at all that certainly makes sense and so we have started preparing data for the handful of countries that are still blank on google maps

3694036 what ive been surfing for 29th february 2008 through 12th march 2008
3694037 vamos tentar nosso m ximo agora nas outras finais vamos ver no que vai dar
3694038 n o posso usar uma camiseta com o nome de uma empresa russa
3694039 pra se assustar fizemos um primeiro at razo vel mas o segundo tempo foi um massacre o crb foi muito melhor nosso time n o conseguiu marcar eles fizeram tr s gols e tiveram mais quatro chances foi um time sem for a sem rea o sem posse de bola errando muitos passes
3694040 tem que mudar temos que rever isto em termos de diretoria n o pode o paran uma equipe grande que vem de s rie a jogar como jogou hoje contra o lanterna do campeonato sem querer menosprezar o crb
3694041 o paran est perdendo o respeito dos advers rios que v m pra cima da gente porque sabem que a equipe fraca esta que a verdade nosso time foi uma equipe ap tica quando tomou o gol se abateu achei que um time sem for a sem poder de rea o
3694042 n o interessa a escala o do advers rio temos a ambi o de passar de fase e vamos tentar obter a maior vantagem poss vel nesse primeiro jogo em casa
3694043 todos os jogadores que est o no gr mio ou no inter t m condi es de atuar se n o est o no time por uma circunst ncia ou outra
3694044 espero aproveitar bem o cl ssico para ao menos colocar uma d vida na cabe a do treinador
3694045 manter o m rcio foi a decis o mais prudente at trazer outra comiss o poderia levar 20 30 dias para impor seu trabalho s que no santos n o tem 20 dias um m s o m rcio est desde o come o do ano conhece todo o grupo e tem a nossa confian a
3694046 o time n o ruim mas n o se encaixou hora de fazer uma parada e repensar para que tudo seja diferente n o devemos nada aos melhores times se analisarmos nosso elenco no papel o que faz a diferen a n o nem a qualidade t cnica mas sim a atitude do grupo
3694047 tamb m come amos o campeonato deste ano como favoritos mas os n meros n o est o comprovando isso nosso n vel est diferente mesmo o que o s o paulo fez no ano passado o gr mio est fazendo esse ano eles est o vencendo fora de casa e isso faz a diferen a nessa competi o
3694048 o s o paulo n o est conseguindo ter uma boa seq ncia fora estamos tendo um pouco de dificuldades principalmente pelas mudan as do elenco normal acontecer isso ningu m se mant m por tanto tempo
3694049 o segundo condiz com o primeiro quem come a mal dificilmente consegue fazer um returno bom acho que a ltima metade da competi o mais atraente por ser a reta final
3694050 eu n o consigo me motivar com o tipo de provoca o do souza tenho certeza que isso n o vai aumentar ou diminuir a vontade de ningu m aqui
3694051 ele um jogador de qualidade que conquistou t tulos conosco sentimos falta dele como atleta e como pessoa mas agora ele est do outro lado e vamos marc lo em cima
3694052 suspeito que a ferrari segue com o melhor modelo por m o time tem sido superado pelos erros de dire o e dos pilotos
3694053 ferrari precisa decidir em quem apostar no massa ou no kimi r ikk nen
3694054 kimi parece ter as mesmas dificuldades que nick heidfeld na bmw para conseguir ir bem em uma nica volta r pida
3694055 ele j foi campe o e s vezes parece que prefere assistir a competir
3694056 a comiss o t cnica conseguiu fazer com que a diretoria olhasse como delicada a nossa fase claro que o vasco tem de entrar para ganhar em todas competi es que disputar mas n o preciso dizer que um rebaixamento seria muito ruim para qualquer um n o isso o que queremos aqui
3694057 resolvi dar uma semana de recupera o porque a gente vem de uma seq ncia de quarta domingo e quarta
3694058 um revezamento de cansa o mesmo de dividir duas competi es n o tem mais novidade t tica para o kl ber e o alex mineiro por exemplo de repente voc tira um e deixa o outro pra os dois estarem juntos no pr ximo jogo essa a id ia
3694059 a gente sabe da import ncia da sul americana alguns jogadores v o jogar e mostrar a for a do elenco do palmeiras temos que tentar dividir bem n o deixar a emo o da sul americana influenciar no brasileiro
3694060 eu estou com a cabe a nos jogos ol mpicos
3694061 claro que sim pois de trata de um dos melhores jogadores do mundo e qualquer clube quero t lo defendendo suas cores
3694062 estou me sentindo bem estamos melhorando a cada partida por m queremos melhorar mais ainda
3694063 n o pensamos nisso pensamos s no que podemos ganhar e n o perder
3694064 n o sei o que dizer fiz o melhor que pude mas n o deu queria falar para meu pai e minha m e que dei o melhor de mim mas n o tive compet ncia para jogar meu advers rio
3694065 embora o resultado n o tenha sido injusto n s tivemos muitas chances de matar o jogo est vamos com 1 a 0 e tivemos tr s ou quatro contra ataques para marcar com mais capricho poder amos ter definido a partida
3694066 foi um dos mais complicados o ava um advers rio dif cil quando joga em casa e esse ponto foi muito importante a s rie b dif cil e temos eu estar sempre somando se tivermos sempre essa atitude de s rie b ser dif cil bater o corinthians

3694075 we have high expectations of finding oil in the dreki area since scientific research has indicated that valuable oil resources may be found there
3694076 we therefore urge all parties interested in new oil fields in northern areas to attend the conference in reykjavik
3694077 at the conference we will go through geological data on the area as well as inform on taxation and financial conditions
3694078 the drilling and completion operation on well 21 28a 10z has been successfully concluded with a gravel pack and screen over the oil pay section in the tay reservoir

3694082 it remains to be said that no one system is perfect and no human entity infallible the question of how to cope with that fallibility becomes more important than the fruitless quest for a perfect system to assert dogmatically that one has found the perfect system condemns us irrevocably to doom if we want a truth then let that be the only one
3694083 it is xenophobic to reject advice from foreigners outsiders based on citizenship alone
3694084 just as we must be careful in choosing what advice we want to take from non singaporeans we must also be judicious in choosing the politicians we want to represent and govern us to make the best possible choices in either sphere it is essential that we remain logical and objective in exercising our discretion about the information we receive
3694085 persecute differences just because they are different or just because they are viewed by the mainstream as treasonous
3694086 it is also because the americans subject their system to close scrutiny consistently that despite their apparent differences with one another and in spite of their weaknesses they are still able to cope with changing situations and multiple crises
3694087 it remains to be said that no one system is perfect and no human entity infallible the question of how to cope with that fallibility becomes more important than the fruitless quest for a perfect system to assert dogmatically that one has found the perfect system condemns us irrevocably to doom if we want a truth then let that be the only one

3694090 i read and hear a lot about our inside guys and not getting many sacks but if you look over the years inside guys arent going to get as many as outside guys thats a fact whether we want to believe it or not thats the truth
3694091 for these guys because they heard so much negative about their sack production you can look back over the years and look back at the ryan picketts of the world how many sacks did he have when he played
3694092 in our defensive scheme we really try to control the line of scrimmage and let our linebackers run we ask our defensive line to do a good job of keeping people off the linebackers and let them run and thats what weve been good at sometimes that doesnt equate to great pass rush i think theyre going to be better there i know theyre going to be better there this year

3694337 i was half asleep listening to my music player at the front of the bus when all of a sudden the van pulled in front of the bus and there was a major collision
3694338 the bus collided with the van and in turn moved off the road and hit a guard rail
3694339 there was another australian on the bus not sure who he acted very quickly to try and do what he could to manage the situation we were able to get one of the passengers from the back of the van out onto the road but the others were certainly very seriously injured

3694342 o tempo que nos resta pouco para tentar finalizar um acordo at o final do ano e a nossa expectativa sempre foi de tentar finalizar o acordo at dezembro
3694343 esse o objetivo dessas conversas estamos tentando ver quais s o as respostas para essas duas indaga es para ver se vale a pena a gente fazer mais um esfor o nas pr ximas semanas
3694344 como negociador me sinto como se estivesse correndo a maratona da qual n o se definiu ainda o percurso eles deram a partida e voc sai correndo mas n o sabe onde est a linha de chegada s vezes voc imagina que est depois daquela curva mas quando faz a curva v que ela n o chegou ainda

3694347 minha impress o que se tiv ssemos mais quatro ou cinco dias em genebra ter amos resolvia esse problema
3694348 o que est sobre a mesa hoje n o pouco bom um resultado que do nosso ponto de vista seria ben fico para o pa s se n s pudermos garantir esses resultados agora seria muito melhor do que apostar num cen rio absolutamente incerto que n o sei qual vai ser dentro de alguns anos e que pode resultar num pacote muito pior do que o que tem hoje sobre a mesa

3694351 i limped toward the door as he grabbed the now very bruised filthy apple and ran back to me to get the door as he stood there brushing off the apple and apologizing we both looked at each other stupidly
3694352 would it be wrong to ask people to pray for rain of biblical proportins

3694357 it is sad that the police allowed them to dictate terms

3694359 they even killed female goats because their private parts were not covered and their tails were pointed upward which they said was haram

3694369 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3694370 the japanese economy is certainly not falling into a hole
3694371 given that japan hasnt had excess capacity excess debt and excess employment this cyclical slowdown is not going to slip into a full blown structural adjustment like we saw with the recessions in the 1990s
3694372 its probably a line ball call whether japan meets the technical definition of a recession which is two quarters of negative growth
3694373 with imports also falling net exports were neutral to quarter on quarter gdp growth in the second quarter
3694374 im pleased that our composite score increased and im glad to see were above the national average in english
3694375 but any good news is permeated by the fact that we still have more work to do james tied the slight increase in composite scores to increased enrollment in core curriculum classes
3694376 were still seeing a lot of evidence that the core courses theyre taking arent rigorous enough
3694377 weve got to ask is the curriculum the same in every place our hope and our goal is that were getting there
3694378 students that take the core curriculum tend to score higher
3694379 by eliminating the opt out provision well see those act scores go up james said act scores will improve as the state strengthens core curriculum encourages enrollment and helps students take the test multiple times to ensure better performance
3694380 but it goes without saying that we would like to see a higher percentage of students scoring at the cut score or above
3694381 if theyre not prepared for college level work theyre going to have a much more difficult time
3694382 yo la verdad es que no tengo tiempo para preocuparme ni creo tampoco que tenga que hacerlo porque conozco muy bien los temas de justicia he tenido el privilegio de trabajar en los gobiernos de los presidentes frei lagos y bachelet en el ministerio de justicia as que ir a contestar lo hago permanentemente es una ocasi n m s para informar sobre los avances que hemos tenido

3694388 the striking iron maiden imagery had a violent reaction from the locals as they regarded the artwork particularly that of eddie as very bad ju ju

3694497 not only does rafael own a plethora of attacking shots he is without question the best defender on tour
3694498 investing substantially in safety and asset integrity in the north sea which clearly demonstrates our commitment to safety as our first priority
3694499 shell is under mounting pressure to explain its poor north sea safety record after fresh revelations showed it has been by far the worst performer in the play receiving six out of a total of 18 legal notices issued by the uks health amp safety executive hse over a two and a half year period
3694500 if they had loaded up this particular lifeboat the chances are it could have been launched into the sea in an uncontrolled fashion which would have caused death or injury as it was held in place by corrosion and not by the designed system
3694501 you can tell warwick that this could still be avoided if shell were to issue a press release stating that their account of things published on 16th june 2006 and widely circulated in relation to the follow up from the 1999 audit was false and misleading and in fact from 1999 till 2003 there had been a sustained decline in essential controls offshore as witnessed by the systemic failures presented by greg hill to the hse in november 2003 and that this decline contributes at least indirectly to the fatal accident and that shell apologises for these false statements and will be dealing internally with the consequences of all this then so be it such a statement would halt my interest and retire into quiet and peaceful seclusion

3694727 over the years traditional indian garments have all but disappeared from our fashion shows more importantly the craftsmanship that indian artisans are so well known for seems to have taken a back stage we need to revive this
3694728 weve noticed that if designers showcase indian garments at fashion weeks they are criticised because of the impression that such events are meant to display only pr t collections
3694729 there is also the feeling that buyers who attend fashion shows are essentially looking at foreign markets and thus would not react to indian designs

3694835 the bristol playbus takes travellers children on trips to experience new locations and mix with other kids
3694836 it is encouraging and heartwarming to see how the irish youth foundation and the d on fund values our work and without their vital help we would struggle
3694837 we had a christmas theme because we did not think that we would be around until then and everyone loves christmas
3694838 of course funding was granted which means that members will celebrate christmas twice this year
3694839 the money means more for our st patricks day celebrations which has now become an integral part of sandwells cultural activities
3694840 we did apply for another salary but werent successful this time im afraid
3694841 and its great to get the grants but theres always more we could use to be honest

3694849 supposedly good catholic man who isnt really good at all
3694850 i was born and brought up in coventry and there was a large irish community around me
3694851 my own mother is of irish descent so i was always very in tune with the irish community from a young age
3694852 i suppose a lot of that has featured in my book which is based on a man living in kilburn north london a predominantly irish area
3694853 i think anyone who is irish or of irish descent will really identify with the book
3694854 it was a devastating time dan was a brilliant climber and was only 25
3694855 he and his friend were on a climb on this mount when they were caught in an avalanche which threw them 7 000ft to their death
3694856 what made that even more difficult to deal with is that they couldnt find their bodies for 20 days
3694857 i had been seeing a psychiatrist following the school fire but i went back after my sons death and was basically told i needed to stop the job and get away

3694862 the ferry was booked out well that shouldnt be a problem we could have organized something with bornholmstrafiken
3694863 that day i sat and chatted to my new found comrade as i often do
3694864 i mentioned to him that i was doing the triathlon in dublin and he seemed really interested
3694865 it turns out that ciaran was a keen sportsman back in longford and listening to his stories was just fantastic
3694866 he would then just glaze over and go silent looking at the ground most likely because of where he finds himself today
3694867 i didnt want to be rude but there was no way i should be accepting his offer
3694868 with an awkward laugh i said that i would run the race for him
3694869 again he insisted that he stick a few quid in for the boys and with that he pulled out 2 14 from his trouser pocket and handed it to me
3694870 i collected 450 for the run and some amounts were very generous indeed
3694871 but that 2 14 is as precious to me as anything i have ever had
3694872 how someone down on his luck can still want to reach out to others less fortunate is truly amazing
3694873 its now vital that older irish people claim all the benefits theyre entitled to
3694874 time and again we see cases where people are not getting what they should be getting
3694875 in light of the current economic situation we are asking older irish people here to make contact with their local irish centres
3694876 they offer a benefits checking service and its important that this is done
3694877 its very important they get the right information they need
3694878 a lot of pensioners here dont claim all their entitlements and in some cases youre talking about people missing out on between 35 and 65 a week
3694879 i know back in ireland the average pensioner is much better off than a lot of older irish people in britain and theres no one really fighting for us here
3694880 we did a comprehensive survey earlier in the year and many people came forward with financial anxieties unprompted
3694881 theres a sense of making ends meet thats being sharply felt by older irish people over here
3694882 suatu ketika umar berjalan kemudian bertemu dengan hassan bin tsabit yang sedang melantunkan syair di masjid
3694883 if that sort of stuff is my goal then thats where the line is drawn i can only imagine if you dont you sell yourself short and you never reach your potential
3694884 i didnt have to listen to people yelling or bickering and complaining it was my escape
3694885 i took a lot of anger and beat it out just me and the bottom of the pool
3694886 in kindergarten i was told by his teacher michael cant sit still michael cant be quiet michael cant focus
3694887 your son will never be able to focus on anything
3694888 we didnt bowl nearly as well as we had expected on this tour
3694889 but the fact that we won the series and were 2 0 up after edgbaston is heartening for us because we know we have this huge ability to improve and yet we are still winning
3694890 technically he is very good so we will have a look him
3694891 theres palpable anger against the club and the way its being run
3694892 i think this is a sign of a greater malaise at the club theres a feeling that rangers are a bit of a rudderless ship and that this seems to happen consistently
3694893 the best players seem to go every saleable asset of the past decade has been sold
3694894 walter smith will be concentrating on getting players in and thats exactly what he needs to do
3694895 but theres no short term solution the fans are angry and even a couple of players being delivered before saturday isnt going to change that
3694896 you find out plenty about people when things arent going so well and weve certainly had a testing week
3694897 its time for our players to come up to the plate and stand up thats when you find out who is a rangers player
3694898 i feel you have to suffer disappointments to progress and our defeat to kaunas was a major major disappointment it was a body blow and how we come back from it is important

3694948 ik voerde perfect het tactisch plannetje uit rustig meegaan me constant bij de eerste drie houden en indien het kan niet tot het alleruiterste gaan ik lag wel op koers om de zege te pakken maar toen ik zag dat de duitser marcel hacker het voor bekeken hield vond ik het ook welletjes
3694949 sprinten tegen krachtpatsers als karonen en tufte had me misschien wat winst kunnen opleveren maar evengoed krachten gekost die ik in de a finale best zal kunnen gebruiken blijkbaar waren alle skiffeurs in die tweede halve finale trager dat komt misschien door het rare wedstrijdverloop waardoor zelfs de nieuw zeelandse drievoudige wereldkampioen mahe drysdale de rol moest lossen
3694950 drysdale moest zich nog reppen om derde te finishen en de griek christou die een wildcard kreeg nog net uit de a finale te houden ik ga dus nu zeker niet beginnen dromen van een olympische medaille ik wil opnieuw een perfecte race roeien en dan zie ik me wel hoe ver ik daarmee geraak beter doen dan athene was mijn eerste bedoeling ik zie wel wat het zaterdag wordt

3694953 wahai tuhanku untuk mu segala puja puji setelah bangkit dari ruku dan berkata
3694954 semoga allah mendengar siapapun yang memuji nya maka sahabat tersebut diberi kabar gembira oleh rasulullah saw
3694955 allah mahabesar sebesar besarnya dan segala puji hanya bagi allah sebanyak banyaknya dan mahasuci allah di waktu pagi dan petang maka rasulullah saw memberikan kabar gembira kepada sahabat tersebut bahwa pintu pintu langit telah dibukakan untuknya

3694959 disunnahkan adzan dua kali untuk shalat shubuh yakni sebelum fajar dan setelahnya jika hanya mengumandangkan satu kali maka yang utama dilakukan setelah fajar dan sunnah dua adzan untuk shalat jumat salah satunya setelah khatib naik ke mimbar dan yang lain sebelumnya
3694960 yakni satu kesepakatan para sahabat nabi saw terhadap hukum suatu kasus dengan cara tidak mengingkarinya diam berarti setuju pada keputusan hukumnya dalam kitab
3694961 sesungguhnya apa yang dilakukan oleh sayyidina ustman ra itu merupakan ijma sukuti kesepakatan tidak langsung karena para sahabat yang lain tidak menentang kebijakan tersebut
3694962 maka hendaklah kamu berpegang teguh kepada sunnahku dan sunnah al khulafa al rasyidun sesudah aku

3694967 aku mengetahui dan mendengarnya berdzikir dan berdoa dengan suara keras apabila mereka selesai melaksanakan shalat dan hendak meninggalkan masjid
3694968 pernah saya berjalan bersama rasulullah saw lalu bertemu dengan seorang laki laki di masjid yang sedang mengeraskan suaranya untuk berdzikir
3694969 keutamaan dzikir adalah yang pelan sirr dan sebaik rizki adalah sesuatu yang mencukupi
3694970 imam nawawi menkompromikan al jamu wat taufiq antara dua hadits yang mensunnahkan mengeraskan suara dzikir dan hadist yang mensunnahkan memelankan suara dzikir tersebut bahwa memelankan dzikir itu lebih utama sekiranya ada kekhawatiran akan riya mengganggu orang yang shalat atau orang tidur dan mengeraskan dzikir lebih utama jika lebih banyak mendatangkan manfaat seperti agar kumandang dzikir itu bisa sampai kepada orang yang ingin mendengar dapat mengingatkan hati orang yang lalai terus merenungkan dan menghayati dzikir mengkonsentrasikan pendengaran jamaah menghilangkan ngantuk serta menambah semangat

3694978 the new tv commercial is part of an integrated communications campaign intended to illustrate bmws philosophy around increasing fuel efficiency and lowering co 2 emissions without compromising on its fundamental commitment to performance and driving pleasure the essence of the communication is less fuel more performance a counter intuitive statement which has formed the backbone of bmws engineering philosophy over the past 30 years bmw efficientdynamics is a holistic philosophy encompassing a number of technologies and innovations all aimed at a single goal maximising the joy of the drive from the least amount of fuel
3694979 the freediving analogy was perfectly suited to the concept of bmw efficientdynamics a freediver focuses on technique and economy of movement to conserve energy and maximise his diving performance on the minimum amount of air in much the same way bmw is able to maximise its performance by utilising its advanced technologies to economise on fuel and reduce emissions as a result of these unique similarities we ended up with a very simple yet powerful commercial that really depends on the incredible underwater cinematography and not much else to get its message across
3694980 it was extremely difficult to shoot in such deep water because of the communication problems at that depth it was impossible to use hand signals but we were very lucky that rob is a certified deep diver and his skill at shooting under water really came to the fore the genuine talent behind the ad is his incredible ability to frame and give an artistic feel to the underwater shots everything you see in the ad was shot underwater by him there was no trickery or clever tactics involved
3694981 not only did didier assist us by providing the cameras necessary for us to shoot at that depth but he also helped us out by providing some technical know how and a wealth of experience for shooting in deep waters
3694982 the shoot took place in a marine reserve which meant we werent able to just drop anchor and start filming for fear of damaging the reefs below so we had to tie our boat to another boat which was then attached to a mooring the egyptian authorities were also very strict about the length of time we could spend out on the water so we had quite difficult time restraints to adhere to and bear in mind that nery our diver had to go to great depths on each take which was obviously very taxing for him so we had to give him enough time to recover between takes due to the very strict diving safety parameters we had to adhere to when diving at this depth our time spent underwater each day had to be limited to a maximum of four hours meaning we had to adhere to a very strict shooting schedule so that no ones safety could be compromised
3694983 we are very pleased with the approach that ireland davenport has taken with our new commercial the analogy of the freediver suits our communication message perfectly and the final execution provides a very accurate and concise portrayal the bmw efficientdynamics philosophy
3694984 were immensely proud of this commercial and of our partnership with bmw being able to create ads such as this is any agencys dream

3695061 we still expect oil prices to decline over the course of 2009

3695075 witnesses either testified inconsistently or lied outright under oath on several occasions the inescapable truth is that both alan bonsell and william buckingham lied at their january 3 2005 depositions bonsell repeatedly failed to testify in a truthful manner defendants have unceasingly attempted in vain to distance themselves from their own actions and statements which culminated in repetitious untruthful testimony
3695076 what the irs wanted was to buy peace from the scientologists you never see the irs wanting to buy peace
3695077 the remedy is not to require the irs to let others claim the improper deduction too
3695078 if the irs does in fact give preferential treatment to members of the church of scientology allowing them a special right to claim deductions that are contrary to law and disallowed to everybody else then the proper course of action is a lawsuit to put a stop to that policy
3695079 you tell us you dont know anything of it but you read the wall street journal
3695080 thats your best argument two wrongs dont make a right
3695081 i think thats what were going to have to do remand with instructions to disclose
3695082 if the irs were saying white people were entitled to a certain deduction and black people were not why would it be such a parade of horrors for the courts to come in and say the government may not act that way
3695083 the view of the irs is it can unconstitutionally violate the constitution by establishing religion by treating one religion more favorably than other religions in terms of what is allowed as deductions and there can never be any judicial review of that

3695113 this is part of hadassahs mission outreach to other places
3695114 before people were scared but now they see the benefits and they are more willing to do it
3695115 you had a sense that you were doing something groundbreaking and they were very grateful
3695116 by itself this meter does nothing it is solely for the guide of ministers of the church in confessionals and pastoral counseling the electrometer is not medically or scientifically capable of improving the health or bodily function of anyone and is for religious use by students and ministers of the church of scientology only
3695117 may be reported for summons or in certain circumstances arrested
3695118 in consultation with the city of london police we were asked whether the sign which read scientology is not a religion it is a dangerous cult was abusive or insulting
3695119 our advice is that it is not abusive or insulting and there is no offensiveness as opposed to criticism neither in the idea expressed nor in the mode of expression no action will be taken against the individual
3695120 were all incredibly proud of him we advised him to take the placard down when we realised what was happening but he said no its my opinion and i have a right to express it
3695121 i really didnt expect it im really excited people always used to call me either cute or pretty but no one ever called me sexy i take it as a compliment
3695122 there is nothing wrong in being called sexy i think the term itself has been misunderstood people think that a person is sexy only if she is wearing tiny clothes but for me being sexy is about being mysterious and having your own personality and certainly has nothing to do with a persons fashion sense
3695123 stardom has not changed me i believe i am the same person i am too new in the industry i like being in front of the camera and i love acting
3695124 im very close to my parents and they handle my money i even discuss my work with them every evening
3695125 gayatri is an independent girl who knows what she wants she is focussed she is modern as well as traditional in her thoughts the role is very similar to the person i am
3695126 right now we are focussing on our career and what we are doing in front of the camera at the end of the day we are both actors one plays a certain character in a film and so we cannot let possessiveness come in between we have to understand each other
3695127 i want to focus on commercial cinema as of now but if i find any offbeat film or a small production house with a good role i would love to go for it
3695128 unfortunately in the ethnic cleansing being carried out by the burmese military junta in eastern burma rape is being used as a tool of war as it is in darfur
3695129 the obvious purpose in my view is to destroy the fabric of the community if the women are raped they are obviously shamed in the eyes of their community often times the husbands divorce the women who are left alone
3695130 victimised by the fighters and then be victimised by the men that you love
3695131 it is very very painful and for the women it is pain you live with all your life
3695132 as for the girls you can imagine the trauma and sometimes i would look at the eyes of the women in the camp and just wonder whether she is one of those who was raped and what is going on in her heart and mind
3695133 within the space of the hour that i had with them ive heard of seven tell the stories of their gang rape
3695134 one woman was 35 years old and she had been raped by several of the janjaweed arab militia in sudan and by the time she saw her husband he already knew she was raped and he divorced her on the spot leaving her with eight children
3695135 obviously if you do this to enough communities you destroy the family you destroy the fabric of a community and if you do it throughout enough villages you can shred the fabric of an ethnic group which is what they are doing in darfur and which is what they have done in the eastern part of burma
3695136 it seems inevitable that extended very weak economic activity and deteriorating business confidence will exact an increasing toll on the labour market over the coming months
3695137 this was an assault in my mind i am incredibly angry about this
3695138 i tried to explain to them that i was a british journalist but they would not even let me take out my identification documents they were very rough
3695139 i am just wondering where this fits in with chinas solemn undertaking to allow us to report freely during the olympics
3695140 unfortunately the poor summer weather shows no sign of letting up over the next few days as well as more rain or showers strong winds on wednesday could make for difficult cross channel journeys
3695141 while this was an abhorrent incident this type of offence on the rail network is extremely rare
3695142 officers in this case have spent many days trawling through cctv from stations between farningham road and victoria and have taken numerous witness statements from members of the public
3695143 id like to take this opportunity to thank those members of the public who came forward and provided us with invaluable information to assist us in this investigation

3695145 whats interesting about web 2 0 is that it gives you access to markets a small business owner couldnt normally reach
3695146 in the 17 years ive been breeding dogs ive never been as far as i am now with my business since building the blog site
3695147 now ive got waiting lists for puppies in fact as soon as the blog was up i started getting calls
3695148 any small business owner can use a blog as an online marketing tool but its more effective to combine it with google adwords to drive traffic a lot of professionals such as massage therapists and restaurateurs are also combining google adwords with online scheduling services and seeing an enormous increase in revenues
3695149 its easy to start a blog but its another to create an environment thats engaging enough to be an impactful part of your business
3695150 your efforts must be driven by core business needs and tightly aligning them with specific tactics
3695151 theyve taken the drivers seat by becoming the early adopters
3695152 thats because web 2 0 enables them to achieve a scale at an affordable price which was never possible before
3695153 if you can identify and reach out to influencers on a one on one basis it can be very fruitful with 100 million consumers actively reaching blogs businesses need to know the right place to get to the right audience with the right message at the right time
3695154 once youve done your flight planning then you can start doing outreach
3695155 there are a gazillion sites out there so you need to find your audience for a small business where you have to wear many hats its helpful to have a way to find the major influencers and prioritize your marketing it helps you gauge what people are talking about who is talking and what you need to watch out for
3695156 virtual merchandise just gives you a different way to connect with consumers and pilot new merchandise without having to go to the expense of making real goods
3695157 in the true smal business fashion we dont have funds we wanted to reach our demographic so we have to look to non traditional media channels
3695158 we saw there com as a very interesting social test to see what kind of reaction we would get to our new designs and over two years wed only have to sell 20 to 30 t shirts for the investment to pay for itself weve definitely hit that number already
3695159 you can tap into customers you can compete and innovate efficiently and effectively you can integrate blogs forums wikis and rss really simple syndication feeds to support activities that are unique to your products and ideas

3695161 though there are three most beautiful girls in the film ranbir simply rocks in the film be it the music video or the khuda jaane song
3695162 ranbirs dresses and looks change with time and have been worked upon a lot he can be seen trying all sorts of clothes that one can expect a guy from the age of 19 to 30 to wear
3695163 styling was very exciting and challenging as all three actresses are of different types and come at different times in ranbirs life so the styling had to be unique for everyone with no overlapping but one thing i can assure you all the looks would be unique and will have an aki stamp on it
3695164 minissha plays a small town girl from amritsar so i kept in mind the influences on fashion in amritsar her look in the film with the patiala salwars ganjee tops and jackets have already become a rage
3695165 she is the most fashionable girl from a metro with all the latest trends in fashion she can be seen wearing shorts jeans and other trendy dresses
3695166 there is always a bonus if we have an actress like bipasha in the film she is one of the best looking women with great attitude and an amazing body and her fashion background does makes a difference
3695167 her clothes are very functional its shirts high waist skinny jeans white legged jeans and has a tough look deepikas skinny jeans are the hottest thing right now
3695168 siddharth anand the director asked me to keep the look of the film young trendy and vibrant he said it has to be a hip hot and sexy looking film which it has finally turned out to be

3695206 i fail on a regular basis and i thought this would be a good spot for me i mean i failed five times in that sentence
3695207 most entrepreneurs fail time and time again before they hit it big and truth be told theres a lot more to learn from failure than success
3695208 most success is a combination of luck perseverance and a whole lot of previous failure
3695209 as bad as it got and it got really bad i could recover now im not afraid to fail you can take all my money evict me and i know ill climb back out its weird people are always taught about success people rarely talk about failure
3695210 i love the idea of not being afraid to fail
3695211 she and i are both going for gold you dont work to go for a silver
3695212 but in the end no matter what i want to usa on top
3695213 to say you have an olympic medal is just amazing and im very proud of that
3695214 our girls have high potential and i think they can challenge shawn johnson
3695215 this is an open competition its fair play i hope these athletes can do their utmost so the whole world can see their performances
3695216 i had fall in prelims and i was pretty close behind knowing i was that close with a fall it brings me a lot of confidence and im so excited just to compete in all around finals in the olympic games is an honor to know youre one of the top 24 gymnasts in the entire world
3695217 going one two thats what weve been dreaming about and hopefully well repeat that either way i think well both be happy with the outcome
3695218 what i want the most at the moment is to spend some time with my parents
3695219 since the last olympics until now i have only spent six days with my parents
3695220 i wanted to compete for gold and now i have ambiguous feelings
3695221 its really scary to compete in a tournament like the olympic games i was under huge pressure
3695222 i think no one will reach that in the next one to two years and when someone does i will set more new records
3695223 the whole team wears it and i have been wearing this for all of the recent tournaments
3695224 because gold in china is the color of the dragon and it brings luck and peace

3695234 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles

3695240 i respect andy obriens decision and i thank him for letting us know
3695241 stephen ireland has told us he is not yet ready to make himself available but has indicated that he may do so in the future as i have said before my door remains open

3695246 my daughter told me about this place and i love the discounted prices
3695247 not only will we buy quality used sports equipment from shoppers which allows them to make an extra couple of bucks but we also provide budget friendly used and new merchandise for them so that they dont break their bank accounts
3695248 what is this self inside us this silent observer severe and speechless critic who can terrorise us and urge us on to futile activity and in the end judge us more severely for the errors into which his own reproaches drove us
3695249 at first there is a little bit of disappointment that i didnt medal but i cant be disappointed id been very fortunate to make it through the rounds in the fashion that i did make it through
3695250 to come from 10th to fourth i am just delighted
3695251 there was somebody looking out for me i was very fortunate
3695252 this whole olympics has been a roller coaster after everything that happened to go from my semi final run to cut it back in the final i was ecstatic and then as people started to go down i was getting more and more happy
3695253 i think that is what has helped me deal with the ups and downs of it all

3695259 one of the stories ive always wanted to play is the parent wanting to have influence over how the coach coaches and in this case wanting his son to have a chance to play before coach taylor kyle chandler is ready to do it
3695260 ultimately the story line gets more personal because it becomes not only about him trying to influence the coach
3695261 but about the pressure hes putting on his kid and coach becoming aware of that and having to intervene
3695262 katie is a fun smart sexy woman who swoops into town and charms tami and they become friends weve never really established somebody that tami talks to other than coach she becomes a bit of an adviser to tami as tami becomes the principal of dillon high school and takes on bigger things

3695272 as science technology and capitalism continue to coevolve into an ever denser global network the ultimate question is whether the human species can reshape the driving forces of change to harmonize social with natural evolution such that diversity and complexity grow in both spheres
3695273 education concerns itself with the motives for effective action for no action is ever carried out in the absence of motives capable of supplying the indispensable amount of energy for its execution to want to direct human creatures others or oneself towards the good by simply pointing out the direction without making sure the necessary motives have been provided is as if one tried by pressing down the accelerator to set off in a motor car with an empty petrol tank or again it is as if one were to try to light an oil lamp without having put in any oil
3695274 historically it is quite doubtful whether christ ever existed at all and if he did we do not know anything about him so that i am not concerned with the historical question which is a very difficult one

3695276 we have reached the point where consumption has grasped the whole of life where all activities are sequenced in the same combinatorial mode where the schedule of gratification is outlined in advance one hour at a time and where the environment is complete completely climatized furnished and culturalized
3695277 the system of consumption is based on a code of signs object signs and differences and not on need and pleasure

3695284 a worldwide audience of billions swooned over the beijing ceremony
3695285 i dont think anybody really thought it would turn out like this
3695286 the roots of this tragedy lie in the decision of georgias separatist leaders in 1991 to abolish south ossetian autonomy this turned out to be a time bomb for georgias territorial integrity each time successive georgian leaders tried to impose their will by force both in south ossetia and in abkhazia where the issues of autonomy are similar it only made the situation worse new wounds aggravated old injuries
3695287 what happened on the night of aug 7 is beyond comprehension
3695288 the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity
3695289 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
3695290 of course peace in the caucasus is in everyones interest but it is simply common sense to recognize that russia is rooted there by common geography and centuries of history russia is not seeking territorial expansion but it has legitimate interests in this region

3695532 adc is recognized as a global leader in providing network infrastructure products and services to the service provider community and they are a natural fit for crossovers growing cellular business
3695533 our new fusion system supports all major canadian carrier frequencies and is being deployed to support the 2010 winter olympics in vancouver
3695534 this new partnership with crossover distribution will help accelerate our market growth for this system and other adc solutions in canada
3695535 consumer authentication for retail banking compliance does not equal security
3695536 stepstone has a long established presence in the aviation automotive and utilities sectors and it is very encouraging to see our capabilities so enthusiastically adopted by some of the worlds leading telcos
3695537 one of the curious ironies of the nhs and many other health systems like it is that it does not pay enough attention to health focusing instead on ill health and disease the nhs diagnoses and treats rather than predicts and prevents
3695538 the government needs to shift this balance as the increasing cost of lifestyle related diseases such as diabetes obesity and some forms of cancer will prove financially unsustainable making the nhs unaffordable
3695539 changing peoples behaviour is difficult and merely giving people information and advice is known to be ineffective
3695540 bold action on the part of the government should include taking tough action to control levels of fat sugar and salt in foods as well as trying to narrow the income gap between rich and poor
3695541 the nhs faces some key wicked issues to which there are no easy or ready solutions these issues are very much focused on the way the health care is funded prioritised and managed and how it has evolved over the years
3695542 there is a fixation on the latest fads and fashion in management combined with a terror by target culture which has resulted in low staff morale and a breakdown in relations between clinicians and managers
3695543 more people are spending more time on the internet and with their mobile phones than they do in church

3695545 they went through our towns and they are rampaging and they are also shooting
3695546 what we are seeing is classic balkan type and wwii type ethnic cleansing and purification campaigns
3695547 georgia of course not georgia but the georgian leadership gave an order which led to an act of genocide which resulted in war crimes ethnic cleansing and this of course cannot go unanswered
3695548 it is clear that both sides are exaggerating and that figures are inflated
3695549 the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt
3695550 we are not in 1968 and the message has been very clear to russia that it cannot operate that way
3695551 remember the narrower the gap between what we expect and what is actually happening the more strength we maintain
3695552 since the summer the turbulence of the financial markets has resulted in a significant increase in sales of ns amp i products
3695553 we did not actively seek to exploit the market at such a time indeed we stopped discretionary marketing in late summer and worked hard to provide consistent levels of customer service throughout this challenging period
3695554 the flight to safety that followed the events of the summer generated unexpectedly high levels of customer interest and investment in ns amp i products
3695555 it was our ability to handle the increased volumes this year without compromising the quality of our customer service that was for me the most pleasing aspect of our performance

3695581 we did sign a petition but it the planning application was passed people say it looks like a supermarket and petrol station
3695582 its a monstrosity the works been going on for the best part of a year
3695583 its a two storey flat roofed building it was part of a garden of a house that used to be on massams lane
3695584 the work has been horrendous the work has been going on for ages we have had vans and diggers it must have cost thousands
3695585 we have had no problems at all hes a good neighbour
3695586 i think he steven gerrard has planted well hes put some really well established trees in
3695587 the new trees are standing at 15 foot already they have been put in in the last few months
3695588 its incredibly close to the road but once the trees have grown i should not think it will be a problem
3695589 it sounded horrific on paper but its really not as horrendous as everyone makes out although its out of eye shot where we live
3695590 i feel sorry for people opposite the build its been a very disruptive year or so for them
3695591 people have just got their backs up because its such a huge building
3695592 he keeps himself to himself he is a good neighbour
3695593 it is a matter of taste it is a fairly contemporary building
3695594 it is a pavilion and garden theres a fair amount of landscaping one of the uses is a gym
3695595 there is a mixed bag of styles on that road theres a huge range some neo classical buildings some neo georgian
3695596 since the complaint an enforcement officer has visited the site but everything is in accordance with the approved plans

3695603 this year there have been over 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the last six years so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
3695604 i would have loved to compete on four events but the silver medal for my team is great
3695605 nobody is going to say you are not supposed to appear but i would say i wasnt necessarily encouraged
3695606 it appears to be consistent with the previous indication that proposed witnesses had given us
3695607 this is a serious matter it has to do with interfering with witnesses this is a committee of parliament
3695608 the chair of a standing committee does not have the authority to take any further steps with regard to this matter
3695609 that the party wasnt really thrilled for you to go
3695610 i am telling you very clearly the national party did not tell any of the witnesses to ignore their summons
3695611 i resent profoundly that the conservative advised lowry whether or not he should attend attending a parliamentary committee is not optional and i resent profoundly them offering him talking points trying to guide what he should and should not say
3695612 i still think it is a valid thing to do
3695613 its nothing but racial profiling that led to the death of that young man
3695614 as soon as they see our kids whether theyre black or latino they see criminals the police are hostile to them they arrest them and sometimes they shoot them
3695615 the police see three individuals of non white culture and they automatically get interrogated and questioned
3695616 its not surprising that people at some point might rise up and say they cannot accept it any more
3695617 if were going to compete internationally for the best and for the brightest we need to improve the way that we attract and retain those who want to work in their fields and contribute to canadian society
3695618 theyre good enough to work here but we dont want them to become canadian citizens
3695619 thats 90 per cent of the 165 000 temporary foreign workers who are working in canada right now
3695620 with nearly full employment an aging population and skill shortages there is an immediate need to ensure canadian employers can access the skills they need
3695621 people are fleeing there is a mood of absolute panic the idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous
3695622 they asked villagers to hang white flags or handkerchiefs outside their houses if they did not want to be shot they say
3695623 behind them say eyewitnesses is a whole column of irregulars who locals say are chechens cossacks and ossetians
3695624 eyewitnesses say they are looting killing and burning these irregulars have killed three people and set fire to villages they have been taking away young boys and girls
3695625 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3695626 we have a tradition that in times of crisis the opposition stands united behind the president and does not attack him but georgia should not have advanced into tskhinvali south ossetias capital in so unprepared a way that was a grave error
3695627 the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them
3695628 we will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous georgian aggression
3695629 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3695630 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3695631 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3695632 abkhazia and ossetia if i mention territorial integrity are to the best of my knowledge part of georgia
3695633 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict
3695634 the reality is that were faced with a slowdown and right now were seeing the commodity trade that whole momentum unravel quickly
3695635 theyre not making any major commitments to the market canada is facing economic headwinds
3695636 when the dollar quits going up gold quits going down its going to take time to repair this dont look for a quick turnaround

3695644 there is a slowdown in agriculture industry and services and the global environment is not very conducive to growth this will affect indian economy as well

3695650 its your finishing unit its like running a doughnut factory without a deep fryer youre just not able to finish off the product and get it to market
3695651 in general if oil prices come down that will be a good thing
3695652 will that be a direct correlation to helping the industry and the economy i dont know
3695653 we looked into it reviewed the file and felt that payment was necessary
3695654 theres a real uniqueness to this case and thats why we decided to follow through with payment to cover the drug and medical costs of the family
3695655 his case points to the need to take a hard look at the health care system
3695656 there certainly will be others come forward we have people approaching the ministry all the time asking for out of province coverage some are covered some arent
3695657 because we brought it forward is not the reason why were following through with payment
3695658 we looked at it just from our perspective within the ministry as to what our obligations were and felt that we needed to follow through on this compensation

3695663 the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of democratically elected government are at stake
3695664 russian aggression against georgia is both a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance

3695667 we are definitely excited when bloggers reach out to us about a forthcoming book we do check out the blog to see if its someone with serious intentions someone who updates pretty frequently and if so and we have extra copies were happy to send them out
3695668 we have a database of reviewers both traditional and online and we keep a list of what types of books the reviewers like to receive and contact them when we have a book that might interest them someone who puts in a cold request will go into the database if we are able to send them a copy of the requested book and we do try to follow up if that reviewer sends us a link to their review then they are more likely to be contacted about reviewing a book in the future

3695672 are important here you have to be ready to take the fact that half of what you do in your life will go wrong maybe more than half but this isnt as terrible as it may sound if something goes bad just get out in a good time just like in poker one of the most important knowledge in it is know when to fold from this idea theres also one good advice for speculators in financial markets you should sell whenever the stock has reatreated 10 to 15 percent from the highest price you have held it yes the stock can boom up and maybe actually doubble up within the next hours but more often than not youve done the very right decision so if you make a bad decision that costs you money the best idea is to jump out of the investment in order not to lose any more money and admit it many people have difficulties admitting they are wrong so that even just this reason might not make them jump everything might turn out well right no just jump and were not kidding protecting your ego is usually extremely painful to your wallet or your life generally you should accept small losses and small shall they be if you jump at the right time as there will be many compared to big gains but the big gains are then more than worthwhile small losses should be valued as they protect us from big losses small losses are part of life all things come to him who waits

3695681 he ewbank would tell me i had to do more push ups
3695682 i said weeb do you want a gymnast or a football player
3695683 i think i did 13 push ups in my 13 years
3695684 if ewbank thought us linemen werent working hard fatso could talk him out of it
3695685 ive been meaning to tell you that for five years
3695686 normally you didnt tell anyone unless your ankle swelled so much that you couldnt run
3695687 your mentality was im no 1 and i dont want anyone else to get his foot in the door
3695688 back then there were no sure things you played from year to year no long term contracts no agents advising guys not to play in camp if they hurt a little bit the whole attitude is different now
3695689 some days you bitched like hell but the next day youd be ready to go i loved seeing all of the guys and going out after practice to hear fatso tell stories baltimore colts

3695694 theres a lot of patients who are using these medications who may not need these or may be able to use a different medication that doesnt have these side effects
3695695 if someone has a hip fracture their chance of dying is 20 per cent in six months
3695696 even those who dont die as a result of it theyre still often left with significant disability and loss of independence
3695697 furthermore use has been increasing in recent years likely because of a number of factors including increasing affordability with the emergence of generic and over the counter formulations
3695698 i think patients who are on these medications should discuss it with their physician
3695699 if anything i said can be interpreted as sexist i unequivocally and wholeheartedly apologize and withdraw my comments
3695700 i have always been a strong supporter of women in politics and want to encourage not hinder their participation in the public sphere
3695701 if they wanted to take me out i would think youd get someone whos looking forward to building a political career not somebody whos at the age where hes considering retirement
3695702 seeing the reaction of people today it would seem my comments were reflecting on the larger group or women in general and that was not the intention of my comment so i thought the only way to put it to bed was to issue an apology and retraction
3695703 when you live in a fish bowl you gotta watch how you swim
3695704 stephane dion must show that these comments are not acceptable in the political process and immediately reprimand his caucus members
3695705 its upsetting and ridiculous to hear this from an elected official
3695706 it should never have happened in the first place there has to be a direct apology to marjory lebreton and i just think its an assault on those who are running and those who would think about running
3695707 why didnt rona ambrose speak out when peter mackay called belinda stronach a dog
3695708 i think its kind of short sighted on her part or anyone elses to insist that thibault be reprimanded
3695709 people are still training for their events and still competing the medals are going to come we want medals too
3695710 i sat in their room the other night and just watched them
3695711 their cribs are close together and they held each others hands as they fell asleep
3695712 it was so neat to see them comfort one another
3695713 we want to have a nice quiet low key day
3695714 maybe go for a walk in the country visit some friends
3695715 we wanted to make sure everyone that we were close to all the people whove supported us could be there
3695716 so we could say we did it we made it to a year and all of you helped us out
3695717 they couldnt figure out how to blow out the candles so their cousins helped them

3695723 the eight regional health authorities all had individual deficits and im sure there are some things upon which well save as time goes on
3695724 the fact that youve got one region buying equipment and representing four organizations makes the price a lot cheaper
3695725 and all of a sudden you want a magnetic resonance imaging system or three of them in the province of new brunswick its one tender as opposed to three different organizations at different times doing it
3695726 were buying in bulk for one organization and those savings are going to be in the multimillions of dollars
3695727 it will be a lot smarter way to do business
3695728 weve saved a couple of million dollars on the administrative consolidation but thats not going to bail the deficit out at this stage of the game
3695729 when my goggles did fill up i knew there was nothing i could do all i could do was swim
3695730 i couldnt take them off i had two caps on so i couldnt rip them off i couldnt fix them i couldnt empty them out i just had to swim
3695731 i managed to get my hand on the wall and it wasnt perfect i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess

3695734 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3695735 people who have never seen anyone else show these expressions they have the same behavioural responses
3695736 an emotion like fear or anger you dont have to think about who you are
3695737 with pride you do im experiencing these emotions because i just did something that makes me feel good about myself
3695738 if you have a success its really important that other people in the group know that
3695739 pride is a clear signal look at me im powerful
3695740 in western cultures people dont talk about their shame whereas in eastern cultures especially asian cultures shame is an essential part of the cultural fabric
3695741 there is a still lot to be done here in new brunswick and its all about money and time science and education
3695742 its a never ending process because we are into environmental and climate change
3695743 we keep looking ahead to see what are significant areas that we might want to help protect that wouldnt get protected otherwise
3695744 a lot of those are on the tidal shores because there is a lot of change and erosion that goes on there others are on rivers and lakes
3695745 this is a site of international importance in the migration of hundreds of thousands of shore birds
3695746 this is just one of the examples of the kind of work the nature conservancy of canada does
3695747 this is the birds last refueling stop before flying 4 300 kilometres non stop over the ocean to south america
3695748 the protection of precious habitat across the entire province is our natural legacy to the future generations

3695979 when i was talking to a lot of the players that they were surprised that i came
3695980 but at the same time they werent because they know its not about money for me i really want to win games thats a big part of why im here its putting that on the line that you could get hurt and those types of things but its in the name of being a cohesive unit and coming together and trying to win football games
3695981 we know what were doing now theres a program in place
3695982 hes been a better run player for us so far
3695983 we got some things in the pass protection going back to the left side he hasnt been there for a while that weve got to work out that tom cables working on with him we got a lot of hopes for him and were going to need him

3695985 i know its strange but i feel quick out there real fast
3695986 hes had some inaccurate hand placement on some catches which is a surprise because we didnt see much of that in the camp before
3695987 hes got so much going on right now and so much pressure on him and so many different plays so were going to keep pushing him and then there will come a time when we pull back his attitudes phenomenal
3695988 i know what i can do they know what i can do and im going to have this be my year where i show the world what i can do so it wasnt a mistake getting me
3695989 we love everything about him the way that he goes about special teams the way he prepares
3695990 we just need him to stay healthy and he was playing well at the beginning of the year last year before he got hurt and we just need to continue to build on that
3695991 de manier waarop hij heeft gezwommen is subliem ik ben hier heel trots op ik denk dat hij met deze prestatie veel respect afdwingt
3695992 ik ben ontzettend blij dat ik keer op keer heb bewezen dat ik bij de wereldtop hoor

3695994 er is een nieuw tijdperk aangebroken in het sprinten ik wil gewoon een goede race zwemmen
3695995 maar een olympische finale is volgens mij niet vaak gewonnen in een wereldrecord voor pieter is er maar n taak morgen de beste race van zijn leven zwemmen
3695996 ik vind dat we nog steeds in de race zijn ook voor goud de race moet nog gezwommen worden de klok begint morgen op nul sullivan en bernard zullen koel moeten zijn om het af te maken pieter werd vooraf in de finales van sydney en athene ook niet genoemd als favoriet het gaat erom dat je achteraf wordt genoemd
3695997 pieter zwemt zoals hij het geleerd heeft nu maken de sprinters de dienst uit vroeger stierven die af na tachtig meter maar nu kunnen ze die snelheid vasthouden we zitten in een nieuw tijdperk
3695998 hij verliest het op starten en keren dat is bekend maar desondanks is hij twee keer olympisch kampioen geworden we gaan morgen een ultieme poging doen
3695999 ik hoop dat de bbfc hier in alle ernst naar zal kijken en tot de conclusie komt dat de game niet geschikt bevonden is voor een classificatie
3696000 het is jammer dat de ontwikkelaar er voor heeft gekozen deze game exclusief op de wii uit te brengen ik denk namelijk dat dit het leuke familiebeeld van de wii zal verpesten
3696001 wat de rest van de wereld met madworld doet moeten ze zelf weten wij moeten er in ieder geval voor zorgen dat moderne en beschaafde waarden de prioriteit krijgen boven het vermoorden van mensen

3696034 its important we keep progressing its important we bring young players through
3696035 weve brought in young darren barr christophe berra two young centre halves for the future but stephen mcmanus and gary caldwell have i feel established themselves as the centre half pairing
3696036 i saw them on sunday and they are playing regularly hopefully theyll be the sort of partnership mcleish and miller were in the 80s they do it for their club and hopefully they can do it for their country
3696037 weve got other people like david weir who certainly hasnt come out of the equation for the world cup i may add that bit of experience but for a friendly game at hampden its nice to bring in one or two younger players
3696038 gary and stephen have played in the two games ive had so far and they deservedly keep their place
3696039 ill keep the young ones in the squad or bring someone like david in if one of the two of them get injured
3696040 davids 38 now hes been a credit its unbelievable what hes done hes still going to play a lot of games for rangers im very happy with my pairing but we need back up and cover
3696041 as a player he has ability as far as discipline is concerned sometimes he can be a bit rash with his tackles i watched him on sunday and i dont think he committed a foul he was absolutely outstanding hes a tremendous player

3696086 interestingly alzheimers disease pathology was associated with physical frailty in older persons both with and without dementia
3696087 the level of frailty was approximately two times higher in a person with a high level of ad pathology compared with a person with a low level of ad pathology
3696088 together both of these studies suggest that frailty can be an early indicator of alzheimers disease pathology and may appear before memory loss
3696089 these findings raise the possibility that alzheimers disease may contribute to frailty or that frailty and alzheimers disease share a common cause we theorize that the accumulation of these plaques and tangles in the brain could affect the areas of the brain responsible for motor skills and simple movements years before the development of dementia

3696108 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
3696109 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really can t understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere
3696110 this becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as china india and brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated
3696111 this chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern
3696112 we ve speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting
3696113 but in this case these two hydrogen bonds are strong enough to affect atmospheric chemistry
3696114 the reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures which is the opposite of most chemical reactions
3696115 the rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure and most reactions don t depend on external pressure the molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties
3696116 here s a situation where we were studying this purely environmental problem but because the findings are so fundamental it may have broader ramifications to biological systems that depend on hydrogen bonds

3696340 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

3696369 there are lots of things that only the intelligence community knows and that no one else ought to know
3696370 united states special agents were told to back off the bin laden family and the saudi royals soon after george bush became president although that has all changed since september 11 a bbc television program has claimed
3696371 but for some reason fbi agents were pulled off the trail
3696372 i complained there i complained here in washington and i was ignored what i was doing was giving visas to terrorists recruited by the cia and osama bin laden to come back to the united states for training to be used in the war in afghanistan against the then soviets
3696373 the bbc program said it had been told by a highly placed source in a us intelligence agency there had always been
3696374 fbi and us spy agents say bush spiked bin laden probes before 11 september
3696375 u s banks that have assets of these groups or individuals must freeze their accounts
3696376 and u s citizens or businesses are prohibited from doing business with them
3696377 but the president who is now enjoying an astounding 92 percent approval rating hasnt always practiced what he is now preaching bushs own businesses were once tied to financial figures in saudi arabia who currently support bin laden
3696378 in 1979 bushs first business arbusto energy obtained financing from james bath a houstonian and close family friend
3696379 in conflicting statements bush at first denied ever knowing bath then acknowledged his stake in arbusto and that he was aware bath represented saudi interests
3696380 when salem bin laden died in 1988 powerful saudi arabian banker and bcci principal khalid bin mahfouz inherited his interests in houston bath ran a business for bin mahfouz in houston and joined a partnership with bin mahfouz and gaith pharaon bccis frontman in houstons main bank
3696381 the arbusto deal wasnt the last time bush looked to highly questionable sources to invest in his oil dealings
3696382 the number of bcci connected people who had dealings with harken all since george w bush came on board raises the question of whether they mask an effort to cozy up to a presidential son
3696383 worst of all bin mahfouz allegedly has been financing the bin laden terrorist network making bush a u
3696384 when president bush announced he is hot on the trail of the money used over the years to finance terrorism he must realize that trail ultimately leads not only to saudi arabia but to some of the same financiers who originally helped propel him into the oil business and later the white house the ties between bin laden and the white house may be much closer than he is willing to acknowledge

3696396 if the united states boosts defence spending in its quest to stop saudi dissident osama bin ladens alleged terrorist activities his family may be the unexpected beneficiary of that media reports said
3696397 among its far flung business interests the well heeled saudi arabian clan which says it is estranged from laden is an investor in a fund established by carlyle group a well connected washington merchant bank specialising in buyouts of defence and aerospace companies
3696398 through this investment and its ties to saudi royalty the bin laden family has become acquainted with some of the biggest names in the republican party
3696399 in recent years former president george h w bush ex secretary of state james baker and ex secretary of defence frank carlucci have made the pilgrimage to the bin laden familys headquarters in jeddah saudi arabia
3696400 ex president bush makes speeches on behalf of carlyle group and is senior adviser to its asian partners fund while baker is its senior counsellor and carlucci is the groups chairman
3696401 carlyle is as deeply wired into the current administration as they can possibly be
3696402 george bush is getting money from private interests that have business before the government while his son is president and in a really peculiar way george w bush could some day benefit financially from his own administrations decisions through his fathers investments the average american doesnt know that and to me thats a jaw dropper
3696403 weve been close friends throughout the years we were college classmates
3696404 conflict of interest which could cause problems for americas foreign policy in middle east and asia
3696405 this conflict of interest has now turned into a scandal the idea of the presidents father an ex president himself doing business with a company under investigation by the fbi in the terror attacks of september 11 is horrible president bush should not ask but demand that his father pull out of the carlyle group
3696406 just a few weeks ago the bush administration another group well watered by the murky flow of offshore capital announced its withdrawal from international treaty talks on cleaning up the money laundering swamp

3696453 i had always dreamed of being a stay at home dad and being the nurturing figure in my childs life was very important to me i found myself searching for something i could do from home this is when i found ameriplan

3696457 the training support and leadership that is found within the freedom at home team is amazing stated ernest

3696489 the pee dee research and education center has been here for almost a hundred years now with the main task of increasing the economic well being of this part of the state
3696490 the programs out here are first class and theyre all aimed at improving the economic well being of the citizens of the pee dee region
3696491 agriculture is bigger than corn and soybeans it also includes turf and ornamentals
3696492 one area that we are looking at is soybean oil
3696493 were trying to link the programs at clemson right to the pee dee and out to the farming community
3696494 its one day that were trying to focus south carolina attention on what agriculture in the state brings to their grocery shelf to the restaurant table
3696495 it just reinforces what they should be thinking about agriculture
3696496 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3696497 and im not saying we are reigniting the cold war but this is an act of aggression in which we didnt think wed see in the 21st century
3696498 for mccains team it has become the latest incarnation of what
3696499 you got a guy who is ready to be president on day 1 who understands the world for what it is
3696500 the thing about sen obama hes playing catch up here his initial statements quite frankly didnt appreciate how bold a move this was from russia
3696501 sen mccain has talked for years about the dangers of russian policies in the way they conduct themselves and undermine the sovereignty of their neighbors
3696502 there is a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience
3696503 barack obama the administration and the nato allies took a measured reasoned approach
3696504 we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive belligerent statement he may or may not have complicated the situation
3696505 russian peacekeeping troops should be replaced by a genuine international peacekeeping force georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3696506 he was not calling for equivalence between russia and georgia he was calling for a ceasefire to stop the violence after russia invaded it was a totally different order of magnitude
3696507 it is based on an exaggerated and deliberately misleading perception of senator obamas initial statement which was issued early while the crisis was unfolding
3696508 this is an attempt by people supporting senator mccain to politicize a great international tragedy and its not worthy of the dimensions of the problem especially when both candidates have roughly the same position
3696509 part of the reason we dont have leverage is that we dont have a u s russian relationship it has been adrift
3696510 its easy to say something belligerent about russia im no friend of vladimir putin and cheap shots about tough talk are all well and fine but what are you doing to actually make the situation better
3696511 this type of bluster is fairly counterproductive because it is a bluff theres nothing we can do about this
3696512 it has become a race to be see who can be the tougher i cant see anybody suddenly stepping back and becoming a voice of moderation and calling for calm

3696525 what has been called the long war is likely to be many years of persistent engaged combat all around the world in differing degrees of size and intensity this generational campaign cannot be wished away or put on a timetable there are no exit strategies to paraphrase the bolshevik leon trotsky we may not be interested in the long war but the long war is interested in us
3696526 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u
3696527 the principal challenge therefore is how to ensure that the capabilities gained and counterinsurgency lessons learned from iraq and afghanistan as well as the lessons relearned from other places where we have engaged in irregular warfare over the last two decades are institutionalized within the defense establishment
3696528 take the battle to the enemy disrupt his plans and confront the worst threats before they emerge

3696531 that far surpasses the capabilities of such previous would be hegemons as rome britain and napoleonic france
3696532 fabled generals such as erwin rommel and heinz guderian seem positively incompetent by comparison
3696533 weve applied the new powers of technology to strike an enemy force with speed and incredible precision by a combination of creative strategies and advanced technologies we are redefining war on our terms in this new era of warfare we can target a regime not a nation
3696534 the american people fell in love again with their armed forces

3696540 we recognise that uncertainty will remain on bookings for summer 2009 until the end of 2008 early 2009 and after a 40 percent bounce over the last month think that some profit taking is possible
3696541 the main holiday is a must have item for consumers in our experience people will cut back on all sorts of other things before they cut back on their holiday
3696542 conscious that despite good initial bookings concerns over the consumer outlook for 2009 are unlikely to go away

3696545 we have played well lately and i think we have a good chance to beat viking
3696546 last season in the intertoto cup we played two very tight matches against aab and they went on to win the title in denmark
3696547 viking have good players and it will be a tough challenge but we are certainly not without our chances
3696548 viking play very tight in midfield where they have their most important players they have suffered a little with injuries though so we will see what their lineup will be

3696556 the pattern of attacks three in a row during the games with security forces on high alert is an act of defiance that is unparalleled in recent xinjiang history
3696557 the global focus on china is an opportunity for people who believe their plight is ignored and invisible to take action
3696558 the concern here is that at a minimum this is going to add volatility to the region and polarize the uighur and chinese communities
3696559 there is also a fear the government will launch a widespread indiscriminate repressive campaign targeted far beyond the groups advocating use of violence
3696560 we can see that the attackers are merciless fugitives so the government should be on high alert
3696561 because they cannot carry out such attacks in their most desirable cities like beijing they have to turn to local locations
3696562 their methods are quite similar to some other international terrorist attacks
3696563 inspired by the principles of malcolm x malik el hajj shabazz
3696564 there are so many they attack celebrities on blogs and teenagers are attacking each other on myspace there is so much negativity around especially for young women
3696565 theyre so competitive you just hope theyll learn to love themselves for what they are embrace yourself id like to see press outlets doing stories on women of all types we all have different goals passions and dreams and you need examples
3696566 so im very upset and im saying theyre taking so much blood that im worried its going to make me weak for the finals of the 100 metres
3696567 and i think theyre going to test me im almost sure tomorrow
3696568 i dont know why they theyre after me i guess they have to catch a lot of athletes hopefully they can catch a lot this will make this olympic games very clean
3696569 im clean ive always been clean i wouldnt even know where to get that stuff
3696570 following a course that is horrifyingly similar to that taken by stalin and hitler in the 1930s
3696571 the undermining of the sovereignty of a small democratic neighbouring state through the use of violence
3696572 georgia is to an extent the finland of today both morally and strategically
3696573 if georgia no longer has its sovereignty it means not only that the west is cut off from the caspian sea and central asia but we can also assume that putin will exercise a similar strategy against ukraine if he faces resistance hes already publicly voiced threats against ukraine
3696574 if russia continues on this path it has to be isolated by the international community

3696584 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3696585 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3696586 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3696587 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3696588 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3696589 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3696590 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3696591 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3696592 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3696593 we believe romantic love is a developed form of one of three primary brain networks that evolved to direct mammalian reproduction
3696594 the sex drive evolved to motivate individuals to seek sex with any appropriate partner
3696595 attraction the mammalian precursor of romantic love evolved to enable individuals to pursue preferred mating partners thereby conserving courtship time and energy
3696596 the brain circuitry for male female attachment evolved to enable individuals to remain with a mate long enough to complete species specific parenting duties
3696597 women are effectively advertising their general fertility with their faces
3696598 make up can improve appearance across the board but it will obviously help people who are less attractive more
3696599 our findings could explain why men universally seem to prefer feminine womens faces
3696600 in evolutionary terms it makes sense for men to favour feminine fertile women those that did would have had more babies
3696601 the findings make sense there are clear benefits to choosing particular types of female faces oestrogen is related to fertility
3696602 the findings about make up are also interesting the implication is that women are employing a deceptive strategy they can fool the male visual system with make up

3696751 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3696752 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3696753 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3696754 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3696755 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3696756 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3696757 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states

3696766 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato

3696828 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3696829 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3696830 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3696831 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3696832 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3696833 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3696834 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3696835 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3696836 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3696837 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3696838 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3696839 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3696840 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3696841 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3696842 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3696843 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3696844 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3696845 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3696846 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3696847 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3696848 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3696849 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3696850 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3696851 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3696852 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3696853 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3696854 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3696855 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3696856 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3696857 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3696858 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3696859 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
3696860 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
3696861 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3696862 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3696863 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3696864 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3696865 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3696866 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3696867 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3696868 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3696869 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3696870 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3696871 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3696872 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3696873 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3696874 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3696875 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3696876 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
3696877 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
3696878 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3696879 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3696880 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3696881 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3696882 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3696883 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3696884 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3696885 i am not opposed to the national reconciliation and no one in my government is opposed to it because i have been part of 12 out of the 14 peace talks held for somalia
3696886 we are really concern about by the accusing of somali media and journalists said daud abdi daud sojras secretary general accusing and arresting the journalists in the coarse of their duties and detaining them unduly are endurable acts of aggression and we demand to the transitional federal government and al shabab islamic movement authorities to immediately instruct their armed forces to respect all journalists and to get rid of and end the harassments and violations against the rights of somali journalists
3696887 fruit is generally expensive in japan and people often buy grapes peaches and melons as luxury gifts japanese are often willing to pay top prices for high end fruits especially for the prestige of owning the very first ones of the year
3696888 that gos version stood out for its minimalistic approach high production quality and unlikely leading male character a biggest video in the blog world
3696889 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir
3696890 drivers will slow down to look at anything something as simple as a couch dumped in a roadside ditch can send minor shudders of curiosity through the traffic flow traffic is jammed with these
3696891 if the challenge is to be graded on objectivity thoroughness discipline and sincerity it passes with flying colors
3696892 what carr excels at where his gifts as a journalist shine is explaining how an addicts life works the economics of it the ad hoc social web the quotidian feel of the thing its an essay in urban typology worthy of balzac at his keenest and least windy
3696893 ehrenreich is at her best and shes very very good when chronicling the outrageous human downside of our economy the costs it imposes on people who cant afford a bacon infused old fashioned
3696894 the voices ebershoff has brought to life here dramatize one of the most remarkable periods of americas religious history and hes just as discerning about the bizarre descendants that can sprout like toxic weeds from a founders revelation
3696895 traffic gets about as close to the heart of modern existence as any book could get yet habits of empire by walter nugent
3696896 although pelecanos pays homage to his crime writing roots uncoiling a lethal subplot involving no good charles baker that spurs a fitting if bloody resolution it is the central questions of how men can have purpose and atone for their sins that makes the turnaround an indelible read
3696897 fuller never met him bryant but re creating him has dragged her into a world of greed and power and destruction and beauty more instructive on the unsettled state of the democratic party and its current leftward drift we are witnessing a tectonic shift from the centrism that president clinton embraced and imposed on his restive followers to a more open throated liberalism now referred to as progressivism that is angry and spoiling for a fight
3696898 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3696899 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3696900 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3696901 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3696902 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3696903 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3696904 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3696905 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3696906 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3696907 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3696908 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3696909 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3696910 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3696911 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3696912 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3696913 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3696914 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3696915 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3696916 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3696917 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3696918 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3696919 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3696920 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3696921 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3696922 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3696923 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3696924 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3696925 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3696926 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3696927 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3696928 the border has been along this river for 1 000 years
3696929 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3696930 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3696931 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3696932 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3696933 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3696934 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3696935 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3696936 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3696937 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3696938 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3696939 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3696940 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3696941 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3696942 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3696943 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3696944 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3696945 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3696946 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3696947 the new 14 492 square meter facility will be gms first diesel engine plant in southeast asia
3696948 it is true we got questions from the sponsors that they would like to see more people
3696949 we never had so many companies doing showcases in the past
3696950 we are of course not immune to the challenging environment around us and the sustained weakness across financial markets put pressure on earnings
3696951 combined with lower real estate and private equity valuations lower investment results accounted for the vast majority of the profit decline
3696952 the good news was that the company reduced its equity exposure again proved resilient in the credit crisis and the balance sheet remained strong
3696953 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3696954 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3696955 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3696956 die vorw rfe sind unbegr ndet und wir werden uns dagegen verteidigen
3696957 china is very very keen to join the world community the world community has more responsibility to bring china into the mainstream of world democracy
3696958 must bring it into the mainstream of society and create genuine friendship it is very essential
3696959 meantime on certain principles democracy human rights press freedom rule of law we must be firm
3696960 one big problem is fear it is a sign of weakness
3696961 but you cannot hide from the rest of the world a closed society has no future it is in chinas own interest
3696962 chinas position on tibet related issues is clear and persistent there is no change in that france can work together with china to rule out disruptions to enhance our mutual trust and to maintain the sound momentum of development of bilateral relations
3696963 if he want i am happy he dont want thats ok
3696964 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3696965 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3696966 could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain who has experience and has been tested in war and tried in peace and another candidate that has not between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not between one candidate thats a talker and one candidate whos the leader america needs as our next president
3696967 clever negative advertising works that is reality the tactic meets with media and pundit disapproval and spawns accusations of negativity but the reality is that a clever negative ad can be devastatingly effective
3696968 the populations seem to be gradually going downhill and its not clear if or when thats going to stop
3696969 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
3696970 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
3696971 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
3696972 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
3696973 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
3696974 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
3696975 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
3696976 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
3696977 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
3696978 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
3696979 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
3696980 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
3696981 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
3696982 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
3696983 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
3696984 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
3696985 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
3696986 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
3696987 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
3696988 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
3696989 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
3696990 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
3696991 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
3696992 who will be the next president of the united states
3696993 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
3696994 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
3696995 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
3696996 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
3696997 its important we keep progressing its important we bring young players through
3696998 weve brought in young darren barr christophe berra two young centre halves for the future
3696999 but stephen mcmanus and gary caldwell have i feel established themselves as the centre half pairing
3697000 i saw them on sunday and they are playing regularly hopefully theyll be the sort of partnership mcleish and miller were in the 80s
3697001 they do it for their club and hopefully they can do it for their country
3697002 weve got other people like david weir who certainly hasnt come out of the equation
3697003 for the world cup i may add that bit of experience but for a friendly game at hampden its nice to bring in one or two younger players
3697004 gary and stephen have played in the two games ive had so far and they deservedly keep their place
3697005 ill keep the young ones in the squad or bring someone like david in if one of the two of them get injured
3697006 davids 38 now hes been a credit its unbelievable what hes done hes still going to play a lot of games for rangers
3697007 im very happy with my pairing but we need back up and cover
3697008 as a player he has ability as far as discipline is concerned sometimes he can be a bit rash with his tackles
3697009 i watched him on sunday and i dont think he committed a foul he was absolutely outstanding hes a tremendous player
3697010 he does get too many bookings and he goes to ground at times too easily but hes learning i think hes a true international player and hes going to be in my squad
3697011 these days in football you need to stay on your feet referees get their yellow cards out even when you win the ball
3697012 players in general have got to get used to that twenty years ago you could do that you could do the sliding tackles scotts capable of staying on his feet
3697013 he needs his enthusiasm and his quality hes excellent hes international class
3697014 thats always been my opinion when i watched him with hibs and with celtic scotts got so much energy and quality he can play anywhere
3697015 for en bra samling folk n r ellers ville du funnet denne gjengen i ett og samme rom
3697016 unbedingt ich bin brigens auch f r ein lachverbot denn passiv lachen ist f r depressive unglaublich gesundheitsgef hrdend also brauchen wir selbstverst ndlich auch ein h ndesch ttelverbot in einbahnstra en warum ist auch sofort klar was wir dort immer wieder sehen m ssen ist dass leute pl tzlich anhalten aussteigen und erregt anfangen mit einem bekannten h nde zu sch tteln man kann nicht berholen weil die stra en in der regel zu eng sind das spitzt die situation im ohnehin schon berlasteten stra enverkehr dramatisch zu her also mit dem h ndesch ttelverbot
3697017 i think a drop of 20 per cent is a bit over done
3697018 weve fallen too far too fast i expect the market to sit between 110 and 120 in the short term
3697019 have taken profits as theyve seen demand destruction in the u s and theyre seeing it spread a little into europe
3697020 u s gasoline demand last week was almost 4 per cent lower compared to the same week in 2007 despite a considerable decline in retail prices

3697033 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3697034 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

3697036 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3697037 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3697038 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3697039 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3697040 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3697041 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3697042 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3697043 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3697044 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3697045 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3697046 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3697047 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3697048 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3697049 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3697050 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3697051 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3697052 tickets for the reception where clooney will speak are going for 1 000 followed by a dinner at the home of nfc member charles adams for 10 000 a plate space for the dinner is limited to 75 guests
3697053 maybe during the convention the republicans can dedicate a large screen monitor at the xcel center to keep track of obamas second european jaunt of the campaign they could call it where in the world is barack obama the show could track him through the summer houses of the rich and famous americans who can afford to own villas overseas and put dollar signs up on a map wherever he stops off for some foie gras
3697054 i have a record of reaching across the aisle and working with my friends whether it be joe lieberman or ted kennedy
3697055 americans are tired of partisanship they want us to work together for america in a bipartisan fashion
3697056 who have a clear record of strict adherence to the constitution of the united states and who do not believe in legislating from the bench
3697057 we will fix social security and we will do it in a bipartisan fashion
3697058 he needs social conservatives to rally to his cause they are the bulwark of the party but he has to attract the middle
3697059 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
3697060 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3697061 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3697062 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3697063 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3697064 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3697065 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3697066 i cant tell someone that just registering and voting is going to change their life
3697067 the system itself is broken due to the creation of safe districts for incumbent legislators we have the least competitive legislative races in the nation with most seats being uncontested and the sad reality is that 98 percent of the candidates who spend the most money are the ones who win
3697068 we need to build a base of support a movement for social justice that politicians will have to respect
3697069 we are registering people to vote not to support a particular candidate but to become part of the movement that will have the power to actualize our values
3697070 what always horrifies me is that no matter what side of the political spectrum youre on there is a relatively small number of people who actually elect our public servants
3697071 in a seven hour span friday detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick endured a surreal journey that found him pleading to get out of jail in the morning facing a pair of new felony charges shortly afterward standing glumly for an eerie video arraignment in the afternoon and finally arriving back at city hall wearing jeans a dress shirt and electronic tether
3697072 the mayor is simply less intimidating today with a tether around his ankle than he was in 2002 or 2003 when he was firing cops who disagreed with him
3697073 others were more explicit about how they thought the distraction should be brought to an end several area leaders made or renewed calls for kilpatrick to either resign or be removed from office some did so quietly while others made public statements
3697074 its going to be broadcast all around the world and its one more blow that the city of detroit should not have to take and for that matter it involves in a negative way the image of the entire region
3697075 if youre doing business in the city of detroit if you own assets in the city of detroit if your corporate headquarters or other buildings that you own and operate out of are operating in the city of detroit you have a voice you have a stake in what happens in this city and you ought to be using that voice to express your concerns about your stake in this city
3697076 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3697077 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3697078 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3697079 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3697080 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3697081 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3697082 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3697083 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3697084 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing

3697098 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3697099 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3697100 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3697101 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3697102 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3697103 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3697104 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3697105 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3697106 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3697107 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3697108 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3697109 who loves flying everywhere it eats mushrooms potatoes and other things it swims in duck ponds and plays with ducks
3697110 she likes to dance she likes to boogie she wears this outfit all the time she dances for the king of twinkleland tutu dazzles with her dancing tricks
3697111 he throws the parties at home in his castle and everyone is invited he likes cotton candy and he enjoys both giving and getting presents
3697112 who has been known to snack on trolls and stray vagabonds every now and then nowadays she lives a solitary life in high mountains collecting four leaf clovers maple keys and things alike
3697113 hes a semi aquatic dragon with a fondness for terrapin soup and mint tea he loves poetry but unfortunately prefers to have it read to him as the pages get soggy underwater
3697114 he loves watching movies and playing basketball he is a pacifist he hates environment pollution especially automobiles polluting the air over the street so he likes to wear a mask when he riding a bike on the street
3697115 this is my dragon furwyrm in this picture you can find him on his usual early evening activity hunting glowdoves a tasty morsel indeed providing not only nurishment but the special life essence called esporia the furwyrms huge eyes allow them to spot these mystic creatures from miles away usually keeping to the misty rocky cliffs near the outer lakes furwyrms have been also known to have an affection for waterfalls they will use it as a giant shower and an easy way to keep their long bodies clean
3697116 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3697117 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3697118 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3697119 i ever only had one car because the other was a government jag
3697120 kinnock said you cant be transport minister and drive a jag
3697121 when you get on an aeroplane do you go and see if the pilots smiling
3697122 hello this is john prescott please go out and vote
3697123 i said gordon brown is the right man for the job at the end of the day they believed in those times that that ship could never sink the captain still had a responsibility but the thing that actually sank it was the iceberg the challenge is how do you navigate around it
3697124 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3697125 this is an enormous waste of law enforcement resources that should be focused on violent and serious crime
3697126 an addictive drug which induces in its users insanity criminality and death
3697127 the perception that marijuana is about fun and freedom it isnt its about dependency disease and dysfunction
3697128 not soon but eventually youll see the development of a marijuana futures market
3697129 hey thanks for the lileks com link where i just spent over an hour scrolling through
3697130 everyone i such an ass i totally forgot that i agreed to let my
3697131 deb amp kelley thank you both im not sure what happened but im not getting
3697132 no issues here either i have windows xp home with ie 7 0 love your site
3697133 i consider fear and loathing in las vegas to be comfort reading i like the al pastor tacos at tacos mexico and i count among my literary influences the chainsaw from doom
3697134 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3697135 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3697136 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3697137 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3697138 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3697139 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3697140 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3697141 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3697142 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3697143 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3697144 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3697145 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3697146 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3697147 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3697148 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
3697149 lo siento por la gente de espa a y de pinto que sent a c mo me empujaban

3697161 the panel came up for auction in sothebys and the story the collector gave to us is that he used to put ads in the local newspapers asking for wood and sometime in the 50s he had a response from a farm in monmouthshire
3697162 he remembered taking the ferry across the river severn because this was of course before the severn bridge was built and driving to meet this farmer
3697163 the farmer wanted to show him a bed but just as he was leaving he said i have something in the cow shed that might interest you it was apparently one of the pieces of wood dividing the cow sheds
3697164 the collector gave him a fiver put it in the car and took it home
3697165 extremely good condition for its age and given its unusual history
3697166 the panel shows us that he must have quite radically brought the castle up to date i think its a celebration of him becoming an earl
3697167 it is at the very height of court style for the late 1510s early 1520s it opens our eyes to a phase of history at the castle we were unaware of

3697174 the first half of the regatta is about trying to minimize mistakes if you can get through that without a bad discard then you can go ahead and sail harder in the second half
3697175 as i speak the russian tanks are attacking the town of gori and are rampaging through the town
3697176 i dont have any secrets and i dont know how to work miracles
3697177 so the only thing i know to do is to keep trying
3697178 to do something i thought we would never have to do which is to reduce services to the people we want to represent

3697189 there has been a squeeze on multiples major markets and small markets have squeezed the gap
3697190 this is a good time for buying and it could be a good time to sell depending on what you are selling
3697191 whole markets with cash flow and arbitron and there is more of a chance that the buyer will pay 10 times cash flow for the properties
3697192 there are no russian peacekeeping units or forces supporting them in gori

3697222 but for that to be possible we first need to understand the principles of how the tumours develop if we know how a tumour arises at the molecular level we can also develop specific therapies that actually treat the cause of that particular condition
3697223 that will require further research however which we already have in the planning

3697278 what people say about the world in groups and how they come to agree and how they find out how things are has the quality of an institution and it should be analyzed the way other institutions are analyzed that meant for example that it was extremely unpromising to put it mildly to suppose that social principles are only acting when folk get things wrong so for example it didnt look remotely plausible to say that isaac newton thought that there was an inverse square law of gravity acting instantly at a distance through empty space between the centers of distant bodies because there is an inverse square law acting instantly from the center of one body to another through empty space and that leibniz disagreed because he was german

3697393 oggi stata la giornata dellemozione prima una grande manifestazione nel centro di tbilisi e gente che piangeva durante il discorso di saakashvili poi una giornata di attesa mentre i politici discutevano ed esprimevano le loro idee sulla georgia e i suoi rapporti con la russia e infine luscita della georgia dalla comunit degli stati indipendenti per ora sotto forma di dichiarazione politica ma tra qualche giorno la russia si trasformer automaticamente in una forza doccupazione non solo formalmente ma anche dal punto di vista legale perch perder lo status di peacekeeper per conto della csi e poi conformemente a tutte le leggi internazionali la presenza di truppe russe sul territorio dellossezia del sud e dellabchazia potr essere riconosciuta come illegale in altre parole unaltra avventura militare finita in nulla non so quali pensieri possano essere passati per la testa dei capi militari russi sempre che di pensieri si possa parlare ma la georgia riuscita a resistere e ha evitato di tornare a essere lo stato che era ai tempi sovietici e cio una grande kebabberia per la nomenclatura russa se analizziamo quello che successo troveremo molti argomenti a favore sia della georgia sia dei metodi imperiali del cremlino una cosa chiara per la georgia non cambier negli ultimi cinque anni ha assaggiato la libert e la democrazia anche se questo a molti non piaciuto adesso spetta agli altri resti dellimpero sovietico decidere se continuare a vivere come prima o imparare dalla georgia domani sar unaltra giornata di attesa

3697515 hqs sales rebounded in the second quarter of 2008 from our traditionally slow first quarter but while we did not directly suffer from the severe winter storms that hit mainland china beginning of 2008 we were subsequently impacted by dramatic cost increases due to decreased tilapia supplies and increased cost of feed fuel and labor although through the avoidance of long term fixed price contracts we are usually able to pass along price increases to our customers the rapid rate and scope of cost increases outpaced our price increases the situation has since stabilized and current prices reflect expected profitability
3697516 hqs sales were below our expectations as many buyers delayed or reduced purchases due to expected substantial price corrections at the end of the summer
3697517 however our direct sales increased markedly during the quarter the benefits of these sales is being felt now as costs stabilize and new higher margin products are introduced to more buyers directly in touch with new consumer preferences this relationship led to the declaration of our tilapia bill of rights which allowed our more direct buyers to address consumers food safety environmental and health concerns building further the relationship and the reliance on hqs quality health product sales were also affected by increased costs as some raw material costs experienced substantial increases a new price structure reflecting these increases and continuing historic profitability has been announced for september 1 of this year

3697529 sudah dekat saatnya orang yang hidup di antara kamu akan bertemu dengan isa ibnu maryam yang menjadi imam mahdi dan hakim adil
3697530 apakah kamu melihatnya mahdi maka ambil baiatnya walaupun di antara kamu dan mahdi terdapat dirintangi salju maka berjalanlah diatas salju dengan lutut lututmu merangkak karena beliau itu khalifah dan mahdi dari pada allah swt
3697531 maka malaikat yang tugasnya menjaga dan mencatat amalan manusia naik ke langit dengan membawa catatan amalan manusia yang telah dicatat yang telah mereka kerjakan mulai sejak pagi sampai sore hari dan malaikatpun menjaga amalan itu sungguh sungguh dan menjunjung tinggi amalan itu
3697532 tunggulah sebentar engkau tidak diizinkan masuk tetapi segeralah kembali dan pukulkanlah amalan orang itu pada pelakunya
3697533 seorang malaikat lain naik ke langit dengan membawa amalan seorang manusia mereka mulai berbicara satu dengan yang lainnya di antara malaikat malaikat itu memuliakan amalan itu dan hamba tuhan itu banyak beramal soleh karena di dalam amalannya itu tidak terdapat amalan berghibat maka malaikat pertama mengizinkan malaikat pembawa amalan itu berlalu tetapi tatkala dia sampai di langit yang kedua maka malaikat penjaga pintu gerbang langit yang kedua itupun berseru kepadanya tunggulah dulu kembalilah kamu dan amalan yang sedang kau bawa itu pukulkanlah kepada pelakunya aku adalah malaikat penjaga amalan berisi kebanggaan dan allah s w t sengaja menetapkan aku berdiri di sini dengan maksud tiada lain ialah supaya aku tidak membiarkan amalan hamba hamba tuhan yang selalu duduk dalam majlis pertemuan kemudian selalu mengemukakan kebanggaan kebanggaannya dengan amalan amalan baiknya adapun orang yang amalannya itu sedang kau bawa dia selalu duduk dalam majlis dan dia selalu membanggakan amalan amalan baiknya
3697534 amalan yang tengah kau bawa menghadap tuhan itu bawalah kembali dan pukulkanlah itu pada si pelakunya aku adalah pemeriksa amalan takabbur dan tuhan telah menetapkan aku di sini supaya aku tidak mengizinkan masuk amalan amalan yang bercampur dengan kesombongan dan takabbur adapun amalan yang tengah kau bawa itu pelakunya sangatlah sombong dan sangat congkak sekali dia menganggap dirinya itu sangat luar biasa dan sering menganggap remeh pada orang lain dan dia selalu duduk dalam majlis dan pertemuan dan mengangkat leher tinggi tinggi amalan yang tengah kalian bawa itu menurut kalian sangatlah baik tapi sesungguhnya di sisi tuhan dia tidak mengabulkannya
3697535 ada serombongan malaikat yang keempat mereka membawa amalan hamba tuhan ke langit
3697536 tunggu dulu dan bawalah kembali amalan amalan itu dan pukulkanlah semua amalan itu pada pelakunya aku adalah malaikat pemeriksa rasa egois dan yang mementingkan diri sendiri saja tuhan memerintahkan padaku untuk berdiri di tempat ini untuk menahan segala amalan yang di dalamnya terdapat rasa egois dan mementingkan diri sendiri saja dan menganggap dirinya dan jiwanya itu sebagai syirik sekutu terhadap tuhan sedangkan di dalam dirinya itu penuh diliputi dengan sifat egois dan mementingkan diri sendiri saja sedangkan pada dirinya tidak ada kesadaran sedikitpun sebagai hamba tuhan yang sejati maka tidaklah diizinkan bagi amalannya itu untuk dapat melewati pintu gerbang langit yang keempat tuhanku berfirman kepadaku orang ini apabila mengerjakan suatu pekerjaan maka dia mencampurkan amalan amalannya itu dengan sifat keakuannya dan hal itu di sisi allah bukanlah pekerjaan yang dapat diterima tuhan
3697537 tunggu dulu kembalilah serta pukulkanlah amalan itu pada pelakunya tuhan tidak bersedia menerima amalan itu kami adalah malaikat hasad malaikat kebencian tuhan telah menetapkan aku bahwa orang yang dalam amalannya itu suka bersifat dendam dan benci terhadap orang lain maka amalannya itu tidak diterima tidak diizinkan memasuki pintu gerbang yang kelima orang ini menaruh benci dan dendam terhadap orang orang yang menuntut ilmu dan kepada orang yang beramal saleh dan berlaku baik
3697538 tunggu dulu orang ini sebagai hamba tuhan tetapi dia tidak pernah berlaku kasih sayang terhadap hamba tuhan lainnya sama sekali dan allah s w t menetapkan aku di sini supaya setiap amalan yang ada rasa kasih sayang terhadap makhluk tuhan lainnya diizinkan masuk dari sini maka kembalilah sekarang juga dan pukulkanlah amalan itu pada pelakunya sambil katakan kepadanya kamu dalam hidupmu ini bukan berlaku kasih sayang terhadap hamba hamba tuhan melainkan selalu berlaku keji dan kejam terhadap mereka allah s w t selalu berlaku kasih sayang padamu maka bagaimana mungkin dia akan mengabulkan amalanmu itu
3697539 ya tuhan kami hamba engkau ini setiap waktu selalu sibuk beribadah kepada mu dan banyak amal amal soleh yang dilakukannya dan waktunya yang berharga itu diisinya untuk selalu taat kepada engkau
3697540 ya rasulullah kalau demikian keadaan amalan amalan kami bagaimana mungkin bagi kami untuk selamat dan bagaimana mungkin dapat kami selamatkan diri kami dari kemurkaan tuhan
3697541 apakah keselamatan diri tuan bukan karena amalan tuan akan tetapi semata mata taufiq dan karunia tuhan
3697542 benar keselamatanku pun semata mata karena fadhal dan karunia tuhan dan bukan hanya karena amalanku
3697543 ya allah kami sesungguhnya mengerjakan amalan amalan atau meninggalkan perintah perintah dan kewajiban kewajiban seandainya kami melakukan semua kewajiban kami kalau toh masih terdapat kelemahan kelemahan di dalamnya yang bila itu ada mungkin bagi engkau untuk mengabulkannya

3697550 bukti dari penipuannya hz mirza ghulam ahmad peny adalah bahwa di hati kecilnya ia mempercayai bahwa pemerintah inggris peny yang tak beragama ini harus dihapuskan dan harta kekayaannya halal untuk dirampas maka oleh karena itu tidak pantas kerajaan pemerintah mempercayainya atau membiarkannya berleluasa bebas tanpa ditahan kalau tidak nanti mahdi qadiani ini akan menimpakan kerusakan yang sangat besar kepada pemerintah inggris melebihi dari kerusakan yang dibuat oleh mahdi sudani

3697590 in this industry you have to have reliable up to date daily news and information gamesindustry biz is by far the best source for the games industry its grown in stature over the years and really is the pre eminent site its a highly effective way to market to the trade i recommend it highly
3697591 a source who has seen rielle hunters baby says she looks like
3697592 der markt k hlt sich deutlich st rker ab als erwartet
3697593 its very difficult to tell apart an asian baby from a downs baby
3697594 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3697595 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3697596 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3697597 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3697598 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3697599 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3697600 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3697601 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3697602 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3697603 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3697604 the university of california did not violate students freedom of expression and religion when it rejected some classes at a riverside area christian school from counting toward uc admission a los angeles federal judge has ruled
3697605 rational concern about the academic merit of those religious viewpoints
3697606 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3697607 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3697608 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3697609 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3697610 this is the fact that will convince people to have more kids
3697611 adam is in outstanding shape he works out an hour a day and walks with his big dog on his farm in sun valley idaho
3697612 he is not definite yet but is one of the people they are seriously looking at they will decide on everyone on aug 25
3697613 contrary to rumours circulating nick mccabe cut his finger on piece of glass in the dressing room after the gig in japan
3697614 he was treated by medics at the scene and then flew home hes fine except for his sore finger and that wont effect their appearance at v at the weekend
3697615 i was having breakfast at the peninsula hotel in chicago and we had gotten a text message and of course we just we had written it off as the rumour the same rumour that had happened the week before so we didnt think anything of it
3697616 and then reverend al sharpton walked into the restaurant and came up to me and said im so sorry about your boy
3697617 and i was looking at him my boy and then he said its true man bernie mac passed
3697618 i came across the rumble strips through their cover of back to black and amy and i agreed it was kind of better than our own
3697619 i picked up their album and fell in love with it then i decided i wanted to sign them to my label and work on their next album it was really as straightforward as that were all very excited about this
3697620 i have never texted or emailed senator obama and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise
3697621 in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone
3697622 i would hope that my friend obamas republican rival john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics
3697623 although i support senator obama i would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate they seem to be doing fine without me
3697624 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby
3697625 and now the baby was having a baby i was shocked a little bit it was mind boggling
3697626 im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3697627 i get asked about beyonc all the time but i try and make fun of it
3697628 sometimes i say shes not my sister other times i say ive stuffed her in my suitcase and sent it to dubai
3697629 i have to have fun with it or ill turn into britney shave my head and go totally crazy
3697630 i get a lot of wrinkled noses because of how outspoken i am
3697631 probably not in the uk because women here tend to be pretty frank and have a dry sense of humor but back home for some reason theyre scared of me and think im a little nutty
3697632 i had spoken with him probably in the last you know maybe about the last three weeks and he was definitely talking about producing some more movies and he planned on producing some other movies he had even looked at doing television again
3697633 bernie was too big out there he was too big on stage for bernie mac not to tell jokes again not to stand on the stage with a microphone a bar stool a spotlight and a bottle of water i cant even see that you know
3697634 i blame our parents they have been married forever and have the best relationship and we have too much to live up to
3697635 its too easy to say that successful independent women are single because they focus too much on their work if the right guy came along i would be happy but im picky and not everyone has to get married and have children
3697636 bernies not the guy thats going to take the day off because hes sick
3697637 i went to see him in the hospital and even when he was in the hospital he was still bernie and he came back to work and he was on oxygen and actually came to work and between takes was on oxygen and he would take the oxygen mask off and do a take and then put the oxygen back on because he couldnt get enough oxygen into his lungs
3697638 i think bernie was too busy living to worry about not living i dont know if he was worried about his health but i know he was a hard enough working man that he came to work with an oxygen tank on that he would take off between takes because he wanted to be there to support everybody
3697639 we had no idea for the longest time and even then he showed up at work like trying to pass it off it was no big deal
3697640 there are thousands of models like all the other thousands of models naomi campbell is the same way for me models are just pieces of wood that i carve to make clothes look beautiful
3697641 women kind of wilt as men achieve as they get older like wine its like oh shes past her prime and cant play a sex symbol
3697642 its just a preconceived notion about women in general and particularly in this industry its a very very vain industry
3697643 my hair and make up artists spend hours upon hours plastering things on me to make me look sexier i think its rare that you feel beautiful
3697644 no one else made mistakes so its kind of my fault i think everybody knows you always have good days and bad days i just wish today was a good day
3697645 were just as good as china we made mistakes they did not
3697646 its basic stuff that frankly they should be getting right
3697647 they make up a substantial portion of our force and we couldnt function in afghanistan without them
3697648 individuals not only served in theatre but paid an extra price
3697649 it is the committees belief that canadian military personnel wounded in the service of their country should receive one standard of rehabilitative treatment when they return home first class
3697650 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3697651 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3697652 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3697653 how is it you were totally incapacitated for those five days
3697654 can you explain how passengers or the captain were not aware of that
3697655 my parents were both writers and my grandfathers were both writers of a kind both newspaper men my father wrote for television and films and my mother who is still alive is still producing lots of books it meant that we would all watch things on tv and analyze them and tear them apart which is good schooling it was also good to see that it was possible to get away with writing and make a living from it
3697656 i have always performed in big sports events i dont know why this is maybe it is to do with the type of music i sing what it represents as it is very theatrical but yet it also has a very popular feel
3697657 ive had a very long career as my career from my first recording stands about 30 years i think committees organizing these things want someone with a lot of experience as there is a lot you have to go through and you have to deliver at the end of the day
3697658 dunner made it clear to some of us in the clubhouse that his asking price is 120 million to 125 million
3697659 thats it theyre saying they are not going to build a strong team here
3697660 if they keep the pitchers they have now well be all right i think theyll go out and sign some hitters if we didnt have a veteran manager like dusty baker i might be concerned but im not
3697661 felt like a whirlwind for the first couple of innings
3697662 i was almost relieved with the five pitch walk to start the game then i stole a base and that relieved the pressure
3697663 and it was like a thousand pounds came off my chest
3697664 it was an exciting first couple of innings especially with those balls in left field
3697665 best play i ever made in the big leagues yes
3697666 the way weve been playing i was not going to let that ball get past me i was going to do everything possible to stop it
3697667 we played a good game tonight offensively and defensively edinson threw a great game and thats where it starts it got hairy in the seventh but javy made a great play down there
3697668 that one play won the game plus he hit a home run off me on a pitch i placed perfectly down where the catcher wanted it and he whacked it
3697669 he was throwing strikes but he was a little bit more wilder than he was the last two times when he didnt pitch as well
3697670 he threw a lot of strikes the last two performances so maybe he needs to be just a little wild
3697671 may be if i have a game like that ill be happy to be a little wild
3697672 the police project lead who works with me around drug intervention has done work with the hospital in terms of awareness of illegal drugs and it began receiving an increase in heroin overdoses which the routine treatment didnt seem to be working for
3697673 so the hospital contacted us and our intelligence officers asked their sources questions and the drug and alcohol action team daat and the drug service providers did the same
3697674 information came back and we have been able to identify what was mixed with the heroin and the hospital has been able to amend its treatment so it can save lives
3697675 thats about as good an example of joined up working as you are going to get
3697676 too many times we have arrested people for substantial series of house burglaries and they have been kids in their mid to late teens who have then gone into prison without any form of treatment come out and started again
3697677 but if they start a treatment programme and continue it in prison when they come out theres more of a chance of long term success
3697678 the two biggest reasons people re offend when they come out are lack of accommodation and lack of a job so if they also have the chance to get back into work and have suitable accommodation all the evidence suggests that will prevent re offending
3697679 if they dont more people will have their houses burgled and their cars stolen and tragically be seriously injured when they are robbed
3697680 the reds say they want to build a winner and are willing to put the money into the team then they trade away dunn for what a single a pitcher coming off tommy john surgery and two players to be named
3697681 they better take the money they would have had to pay dunn next season and get some established players from the coming free agent pool if they dont i can see a lot of people finding something else to do next summer instead of spending their hard earned money at great american ball park

3697711 masalahnya ada ketidakpedulian dari masyarakat maupun parpol sosialisasi harus lebih masif dengan format yang menarik perhatian dan membangkitkan kesadaran untuk memilih
3697712 pure coincidence but there was a stack of color action photos of dunn on bruces shelf and that was no coincidence
3697713 he gave em to me and i just decided to bring em
3697714 im absolutely going to miss dunn even more so than ken griffey we had a relationship before i got to the big leagues working out together in texas during the offseason and he worked his tail off
3697715 were still going to be friends but this place is a lot different now
3697716 were moving forward and we have to accept it for what it is and the way it is you cant give up just because people are gone you have to move forward nothing stops for anyone in this game the show must go on
3697717 what we have now are three center fielders jay bruce in right corey patterson in center and rookie call up chris dickerson in left

3697719 right into the fire tonight getting called up i expected it
3697720 i played center most of the time but the past couple of years they emphasized me moving around i played left a lot when jay bruce was at louisville and he played center we rotated and got our fair share of experience

3697749 everybody in the world is going to be watching this convention so why not show golden
3697750 very upbeat people who believe in golden the clientele at the buffalo rose gets a little different

3698083 how to learn the alexander technique a manual for students
3698084 in recent years some alexander technique students have expressed a longing to do flexibility work but have assumed they couldnt devote enough time to it
3698085 what was that i asked put my joints through their range of motion each day he showed me how much flexibility he had gained in a week doing that and we began to systematically play with the idea sure enough it works like magic and takes only about five minutes a day with no necessity that the five minutes be consecutive the student simply begins with the joint of the head and the spine rotating the head and tilting then moves on the the jaw then on to the ribs moving them at their joints with the vertebrae by taking a good breath then the student moves all four joints of the arm structure and the hand joints then the spine bending forward backward to each side spiraling and twisting then the hip joint knee and ankle and the foot joints thats it done correctly this routine increases flexibility faster than anything i know and i have wondered and wondered why i now think two factors contribute first the quality of attention brought to the movement which is the kind of attention that makes it possible for the body to learn from each movement second some of the movements are ones that many people rarely make like rotation at the upper arm joint with the shoulder blade and rotation at the hip joint the body seems to delight in these movements and the availability seems to free the joint

3698096 sa palagay ko naman ay di tatalikuran ni pangulong arroyo ang kanyang mga nasabi na sa ibang okasyon na bababa sya sa pwesto sa katapusan ng kanyang termino sa in my opinion president arroyo will not go back on what she said on other occasions that she will step down from her post at the end of her term in 2010

3698129 as one audience member put it in a question to university of chicago economist allen sanderson dont you agree that throwing a party can be an impetus to clean up the house
3698130 i dont think anyone ever had a party on a saturday night because they wanted to clean up the house replied sanderson who argued that while the olympics might leave behind a legacy of improvements it would be more prudent to simply spend the money on those projects now for example if chicagos bid is successful as all panelists seem to agree was highly likely an empty truck parking lot near mccormick place will become the olympic village and then after 2016 a new public housing complex but if we want the housing complex why not just build it now sanderson argued that the question we should be asking is we have a plan how do the olympics fit in rather than how can we benefit from hosting the olympics furthermore he rejected the pro olympic argument that much of the financial backing for the games would be provided by contributions from the private sector after all each philanthropist who donates money to make the olympics happen isnt donating that money to another worthy cause such as a charity

3698209 because of excessive revisions and inputs from a wide number of people the draft policy now sounds more like a law than a policy
3698210 and this was exactly the observation of the law ministry about the policy when the energy ministry sent the draft to the law ministry a few months back
3698211 that is why the law ministry observed that instead of such a policy the government should work on several laws instead of just one

3698247 more useful fun or interesting by adding the element of location
3698248 i think everyone was shocked to hear that the americans were holding this woman at bagram in afghanistan from the information coming through i am told she is being held in exactly the same conditions as the men and has absolutely no privacy when it comes to toilet and shower facilities
3698249 this would never happen to a western woman and it shows just how women are viewed by the us military there is even a suggestion she has been molested and sexually abused by her captors we need to demand the truth
3698250 i was released on humanitarian grounds mercifully my treatment was good respectful and decent although still terrifying
3698251 i remembered moazzam telling me about the womans screams and how he first imagined they could be from his wife in truth i thought maybe he had just been listening to a tape recorder as part of a form of mental torture
3698252 however we now know the screams came from a woman who has been held in bagram for some years and without compromising anyone we can also reveal from impeccable sources that her prison number is 650
3698253 this information has been enough to scramble the pakistan media into action by demanding the return of this woman to her homeland immediately
3698254 prisoner 650 is just the tip of a very nasty iceberg of human rights abuses illegal detentions and rendition flights it is a shameful episode in pakistans history which must be put right
3698255 i wonder how can we hand over our sister to the non muslims for their illegal trial by men whose history is full of rape and other abuses to prisoners
3698256 i began to hear the chilling screams of a woman next door why have you got a woman next door they told me there was no woman but i was unconvinced those screams echoed through my worst nightmares for a long time and i later learned in guantanamo from other prisoners that they had heard the screams too
3698257 while on the run one not only confirmed he had heard a womans screams but said he had seen her
3698258 my story made international headlines front page pictures and major stories on tv but there has not been one word not one paragraph about prisoner 650 the grey lady of bagram a murderous detention facility under control of the u s military and intelligence services
3698259 all like the grey lady of bagram have been illegally abducted by secretive intelligence agencies they began disappearing in 2001 during the so called war on terror

3698262 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3698263 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3698264 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3698265 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3698266 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3698267 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3698268 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3698269 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3698270 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3698271 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3698272 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3698273 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3698275 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3698276 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3698283 individual eating habits tend to change dramatically over the weekend
3698284 you tend to see people consuming more alcoholic beverages and more calorie dense foods its a real easy recipe to gain weight
3698285 eat a healthy breakfast on the weekend when you have more time
3698286 you usually eat less during the day if you start with a healthy breakfast and you get some good nutrition
3698287 saving yourself backfires you usually end up eating way more than you would have if you ate normally throughout the day
3698288 have a little bite to eat before you go out to take the edge off your hunger and then simply enjoy good food when you go out
3698289 allow yourself to enjoy good food and savor it rather than overindulge in it
3698290 people forget what the whole eating experience is about sitting with friends enjoying your time together and relaxing
3698291 it takes 15 20 minutes for your brain to signal your stomach that its full so take your time
3698292 whether youre at a party or eating out on the weekend remember to slow down when youre eating
3698293 take your time when you order at a restaurant and start with soup
3698294 then have the waiter come back so you can order an entr e youll order much less than if you ordered all at once
3698295 splitting an entree with a friend is a great way to make a significant cut in calories on the weekend
3698296 choose something that is really delightful to you and split it with a friend keep an eye out for portion sizes and if the dessert you want is huge ask the waiter to slice it thin or split it with the table but im all for dessert
3698297 if you can cut out one or two drinks per day on the weekend that will save you 100 to 150 plus calories
3698298 wear a tighter pair of pants when you go out on the weekend
3698299 wear something thats not uncomfortable but that reminds you there are limits to what you should eat
3698300 use water to satisfy thirst rather than soda which many people drink more of on the weekends
3698301 not only are they consuming a tremendous amount of calories but soda is high in fructose which stimulates the appetite

3698304 your friend is the man who knows all about you and still likes you

3698396 i think this the protest has taught us a lesson that some of our decisions have to be made well understood at the lower level of the party probably we didnt make it too clear
3698397 we have communicated to the bar council our views and pas had came out with a statement party leader abdul hadi awang had made it quite clear that we must allow the forum but it has to be close door
3698398 i have tried to get muslim leaders to appreciate the fact that we must allow a discussion on religious issues if youre not confident to discuss the matter then theres something wrong with our belief and faith you must be confident to express counter and argue

3698400 not only non muslims but muslims should have listened to her we have lost that chance

3698446 white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush tahir jalil habbush the director of the mukhabarat to saddam hussein backdated to july 1 2001
3698447 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq

3698453 they are likely to use any bomb they build both because of ideology and because of fear of israeli nuclear pre emption thus an israeli nuclear strike to prevent the iranians from taking the final steps toward getting the bomb is probable the alternative is letting tehran have its bomb in either case a middle eastern nuclear holocaust would be in the cards
3698454 the first thing is that the whole event is very undesirable in terms of both the domestic situation in jammu and kashmir and its linkage with the larger bilateral peace process between india and pakistan
3698455 i think this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive

3698492 my parents were both writers and my grandfathers were both writers of a kind both newspaper men my father wrote for television and films and my mother who is still alive is still producing lots of books it meant that we would all watch things on tv and analyse them and tear them apart which is good schooling it was also good to see that it was possible to get away with writing and make a living from it
3698493 i did nothing i would really say amounted to anything
3698494 i was worried i would end up trying to repeat it i tried doing something that went down a blind alley working on a novel for a while for which i did a lot of research but finding it was a bad idea then i started on the short stories which was about as opposite to a historical novel as you can get i was very keen on not writing historical fiction
3698495 for some insane reason my parents had hung onto my old school books from that time so i looked at those and the writing was helpful
3698496 that was one of the challenges to make it not too cute
3698497 i am very interested in going back to the historical but much further back than the victorians but still in rome i tend to do the research first and then see what seems interesting and where it might go
3698498 these days i tend to read non fiction that might throw up an idea i find i am getting more interested in things that are more diverse from science to history to geology i tend to get lead on by some idea that seems interesting something i have always wanted to know about and read a lot about it even so that if it does not go anywhere it feels satisfying

3698545 we dont want to promote fear but you have to be truthful a pandemic could be very devastating
3698546 when a pandemic does happen being informed and educated on the subject will make you much more prepared to deal with what might take place
3698547 our approach has been to pray for the best but plan for the worst
3698548 the severity of the pandemic will determine how much our daily lives and routines are affected
3698549 were planning for a pandemic that is more like 1918 when the schools and a number of businesses were closed and public gatherings were prohibited
3698550 if it turns out that what we end up with is more like 1957 or 1968 well be very happy to have over prepared
3698551 pandemics usually arise when a new strain of influenza emerges meaning people have no immunities to it
3698552 that means more people will get sick and chances are that more people will die
3698553 it could be the bird flu or perhaps another strain but that really doesnt matter what we want people to do is learn a little bit about pandemics and how one may affect their lives
3698554 we have to be careful that we dont scare people or that they dont grow tired of the message and tune out
3698555 in an event that has the potential to be so large being prepared really is our best defense
3698556 as a county as a city and as individual citizens we need to take responsibility for our own health and safety we need to make sure that were ready to respond and to care for our own

3698574 taking advantage of this lull we are reburying those killed in the georgian aggression

3698576 there is no way in good conscience that we could proceed with a joint naval exercise given the state of this crisis
3698577 the risk of such drills lies in the fact that they take place near the ceasefire line with syria and also because defense minister ehud barak and idf chief of staff gabi ashkenazi came to supervise them personally
3698578 im convinced the students can tell us what is really going on in education what is working for them

3698580 some of the highest career demands in the field today are jobs that simply did not exist 20 years ago a person who has been challenged to think independently can adapt to a new setting
3698581 im passionate about education and the fun went out when we got those tests
3698582 ill wake up at 2 in the morning and see a face in my mind and how ive got to get this person to pass the test
3698583 it keeps kids attention focused more on whats going on in class
3698584 we try so hard to cram so much in to get ready for the test and we dont have time to go over what we have trouble with
3698585 we are so focused on trying to meet those mandates that there is an emphasis on trying to make every child alike
3698586 im not suggesting we need sameness everywhere in ohio and that every district in ohio has to do what every other district in ohio every school has its own unique problems pluses and minuses
3698587 our teachers to defend them when they come out of school theyre not properly trained to do those hands on activities
3698588 i think this is a great idea to go and hear what the citizens think about education
3698589 im in support of year round school we need to concentrate on school buildings themselves all kids need to be in great learning environments
3698590 animal abusers are cowards they take their issues out on the most defenceless beings available to them

3698626 she told me you people at the wachusett chess club should have a tv program we talked about it but it was sally who spurred us on
3698627 are actual games that are played what we do is explain them we give analysis not complicated analysis we gear the program to someone who plays chess who would understand the game tactics

3698630 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3698631 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3698632 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3698633 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3698634 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3698635 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3698636 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3698637 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

3698641 the controversies surrounding the water produced by coal bed methane development in wyoming stimulated enough interest we were able to get funding to undertake this concerted effort
3698642 at this point going from 1 800 to 5 200 we just cant do it
3698643 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3698644 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3698645 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3698646 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3698647 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3698648 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3698649 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3698650 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3698651 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3698652 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3698653 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3698654 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3698655 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3698656 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3698657 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3698658 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3698659 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3698660 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3698661 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3698662 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3698663 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3698664 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3698665 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3698666 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3698667 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3698668 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3698669 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3698670 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3698671 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3698672 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3698673 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3698674 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3698675 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3698676 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3698677 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3698678 who are open to doing something on the production side
3698679 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3698680 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3698681 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3698682 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3698683 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3698684 prime looks terrible and were sorry we can say it eight times it looks terrible
3698685 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3698686 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3698687 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3698688 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3698689 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3698690 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3698691 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3698692 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3698693 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3698694 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3698695 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3698696 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3698697 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3698698 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3698699 the first funkyou site was a project started by okapi studio around 2004 and like many of those reading this right now we were watching and posting on that site everybody thought it was a cool project but then towards the end of 2005 it all stopped and sometime after that the domain registration for funkyou ro expired
3698700 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3698701 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3698702 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3698703 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3698704 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3698705 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3698706 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3698707 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3698708 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3698709 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3698710 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3698711 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3698712 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3698713 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3698714 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3698715 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3698716 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3698717 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3698718 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3698719 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3698720 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3698721 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

3698724 discarding fish not only means a massive waste of food and potential income it also leads to unrecorded catches resulting in a poorer scientific basis for our management decisions
3698725 i want a requirement that all fish caught in norwegian waters also by foreign vessels must be taken to port regardless of which final port is used we will introduce new requirements as a condition for obtaining licenses to fish that vessels cannot discard valuable fish caught here
3698726 this must stop now the eu community cannot be taken seriously if it allows this kind of behaviour this is certainly not how to manage the worlds resources
3698727 it is a disgrace this practice is depleting populations that are already overfished and it is happening everywhere
3698728 all of these fish are perfectly marketable and have been legally caught but if you are a fisherman it makes more economic sense to take boat to market with the most saleable fish so you discard the lowest value stuff
3698729 it is out of contact we very rarely fish in norwegian waters thats the first time in years
3698730 the reason there are discards is the ridiculously low quotas fishermen cannot make a living with them they are at a ridiculous level
3698731 throwing dead fish back into the sea is a waste that nobody wants to see but there is no easy answer the uk is keen to ensure more effective and sustainable fisheries by reducing by catch and discards and the government is working closely with fishermen to achieve that

3698737 since we have the bible why do we have the book of concord the lutheran confessions are a summary and explanation of the bible they are not placed over the bible they do not take the place of the bible the book of concord is how lutherans are able to say together as a church this is what we believe this is what we teach this is what we confess the reason we have the book of concord is because of how highly we value correct teaching and preaching of gods word

3698781 since the summer the turbulence of the financial markets has resulted in a significant increase in sales of ns amp i products
3698782 we did not actively seek to exploit the market at such a time indeed we stopped discretionary marketing in late summer and worked hard to provide consistent levels of customer service throughout this challenging period
3698783 the flight to safety that followed the events of the summer generated unexpectedly high levels of customer interest and investment in ns amp i products
3698784 it was our ability to handle the increased volumes this year without compromising the quality of our customer service that was for me the most pleasing aspect of our performance

3698792 he was the kind of young man that we want fighting for us because he felt it an honor to protect us
3698793 he had a real strong sense of what was right and just
3698794 he was very computer literate and knew way more than i did

3698808 we feel that the use of the word retard throughout the film 15 or more times is done without any regard for the dignity of people with intellectual disabilities the caricatures of people with intellectual disabilities are almost hateful we want this to be the end of hollywood treating this population as the butt of jokes
3698809 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities

3698851 she was a film maker who couldnt find funding he was an advertiser looking for new ways to sell his clients wares in a world of fragmenting media their affair was inevitable but would it last
3698852 i didnt want to get involved in some kind of corporate ego trip
3698853 when i read the script i forgot about it being for anyone and just got on with making it
3698854 the contract said that if shane was asked to put in a smiling train driver or had any other interference he would take his name off the project
3698855 advertising works by making people feel warm inside about the brand if eurostar comes out of the film with a vague glow it will have worked but thats impossible to measure
3698856 traditional tv and print advertising is not reaching audiences because theyre often somewhere else so you have to try new things
3698857 mother may not get a fee or a cut of the box office but they do get fame and keeping your image at the top matters a lot internally in the industry
3698858 if you were cynical you could say its playing to the money but i didnt see that on the screen at all
3698859 shane has one of those voices thats completely unique and in fact there is far more evidence of wrong notes in his big budget film once upon a time in the midlands
3698860 if you go with the knowledge of why it was made thats still better than going to see bean and finding its an advert for m amp ms with those sweets in every scene
3698861 nearly every major hollywood film has a product placement arrangement it was there at the roots of cinema and the beginning of mass popular fiction in the 1860s companies paid to have their products mentioned in serial fiction characters would be described buying them in shops or walking past billboards
3698862 soaps often forge relationships with campaigning groups and government departments when developing their storylines
3698863 previously you might give 50 000 to have your brand of cigarettes in a film the difference here is that eurostar paid for the film in its entirety

3698903 i am well aware that some people have called on me and on the department to take even more drastic steps
3698904 where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3698905 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3698906 in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3698907 i want to stress that last point because there is no denying it the system failed
3698908 the active wrongdoing detailed in the two joint reports was not systemic in that only a few people were directly implicated in it but the failure was systemic in that the system the institution failed to check the behavior of those who did wrong there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3698909 i have made repeatedly clear in both private meetings with department employees and in public appearances that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3698910 two wrongs do not make a right the people hired in an improper way did not themselves do anything wrong

3698913 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3698914 i believe that we need to create a special committee in the u s senate to exercise oversight over contracting abuses related to reconstruction and the wars in iraq and afghanistan
3698915 i still believe that we need to establish a bipartisan truman committee with subpoena power to exercise the oversight that these abuses demand
3698916 i dont think john mccain has really made his case to hunters and anglers
3698917 things were very different in 2004 everybody knew that george w bush was from texas he was a rancher and that he went hunting we havent seen that from mccain the unknown he really needs to come out as a sportsman neither candidate has talked a lot about the issues that are important to us
3698918 if senator obama is elected president the rights of law abiding gun owners will be at risk
3698919 sportsmen view john mccain as good company in the great outdoors
3698920 theyre just not sure how much fun barack obama would be in a duck blind
3698921 if senator obama is elected president the rights of law abiding gun owners will be at risk
3698922 if senator obama is elected president the rights of law abiding gun owners will be at risk
3698923 i think these poll numbers show something that should worry mcsame more than a few sportsmen if thats a headline story these poll numbers should be too comeon guys if the story has positive news for obama you ignore it
3698924 these five nuclear and missile entities have been used by iran to hide its illicit conduct and further its dangerous nuclear ambitions

3698926 to confront donors to conservative groups hoping to create a chilling effect that will dry up contributions the warning letter is intended as a first step alerting donors who might be considering giving to right wing groups to a variety of potential dangers including legal trouble public exposure and watchdog groups digging through their lives the group is also hoping to be able to respond if an outside conservative group broadcasts a television advertisement attacking senator barack obama or another democratic candidate by running commercials exposing the donors behind the advertisements

3698928 public financing until we can find another model to follow
3698929 it is not every day that 1 600 of your fellow compatriots are killed in cold blood
3698930 i think that its too early to make any final judgments because we are talking about a complicated situation
3698931 the aggressor has been punished and his military forces routed
3698932 i think russia is getting more nationalistic and i think its been strengthened in this reasserting of sovereignty
3698933 music videos and flowery speeches are one thing but the shelling of a city that you view as one of your heartland is not done lightly
3698934 clearly this is going to be a signal point in his legacy
3698935 the question is who is the client is the adviser loyal to income from a foreign client or is he loyal to the candidate he is working for now

3698938 the embassy of georgia requested the call because of georgian concerns over recent russian actions dealing with south ossetia and abkhazia
3698939 scheunemann and others on the foreign policy staff are involved in call requests and statements on foreign policy issues
3698940 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3698941 georgia has acted with restraint in its response and should continue to do so
3698942 are they really your own views or are they the views that are bought and paid for by the clients of your top aides mccain probably would be sympathetic to georgia regardless but having a guy like scheunemann as a top aide raises questions
3698943 its these sorts of appearances of a conflict of interest that are a natural consequence of having a campaign run by lobbyists staffed by lobbyists and being ensconced in a lobbyist culture for over a quarter of a century
3698944 is what is at stake when russia engages in behavior that looks like it came from another time
3698945 is as much interested in the relations with russia as russia is in the relations with the united states
3698946 when were trying to negotiate a resolution with the russians
3698947 russia wants membership of the wto but it needs to play by international rules
3698948 europe and russia want a wideranging partnership and co operation agreement
3698949 but this needs all sides to play by the rules business as usual is not compatible with russian aggression in georgia
3698950 a lot more to lose than the soviet union did in 68

3698954 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt and whose background you are beginning to wonder about she has brought real results and even his words today are in doubt invented for a campaign ultimately he cannot win against john mccain
3698955 must now in earnest show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3698956 does anyone believe it is possible to win the nomination without over these two months raising all these issues against him
3698957 a nice campaign that wins the states alone that can be won will that be enough or do serious issues have to raised about him
3698958 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3698959 we are never going to say anything about his background we have to show the value of ours when it comes to making decisions understanding the needs of most americans the invisible americans
3698960 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt
3698961 make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
3698962 credibility on capitol hill one member and staff at a time
3698963 the truth of the matter is this isnt exactly how we would have wished to come to this job
3698964 there have been a number of events that have occurred and collectively have made folks uneasy and understandably so our task in the near term and in the months ahead is to get after this stabilize our situation and recommit ourselves to those things that we know will produce the right outcomes
3698965 there is much less room for poor performance and certainly for misconduct
3698966 we will be active on this and be surgical if thats what is needed
3698967 i think it is safe to say that we see things perhaps a little bit differently
3698968 its all about what we do for the joint team
3698969 it doesnt mean were perfect and we certainly have work to do things to fix fences to mend those areas where others have found fault we are going to work with a vengeance and well tidy that up and the united states air force will remain the finest air force on the planet

3698978 my parents were both writers and my grandfathers were both writers of a kind both newspaper men my father wrote for television and films and my mother who is still alive is still producing lots of books it meant that we would all watch things on tv and analyse them and tear them apart which is good schooling it was also good to see that it was possible to get away with writing and make a living from it
3698979 i have always performed in big sports events i dont know why this is maybe it is to do with the type of music i sing what it represents as it is very theatrical but yet it also has a very popular feel
3698980 ive had a very long career as my career from my first recording stands about 30 years i think committees organising these things want someone with a lot of experience as there is a lot you have to go through and you have to deliver at the end of the day
3698981 better enforcement of the existing law will reduce the number of incidents
3698982 the law requires us to deliver to every single address but it doesnt protect our members from out of control dangerous and aggressive dogs
3698983 as a result of this consultation the governments view is that the legislation in place is both proportionate and robust enough to deal with dogs that are dangerous or pose a threat there are no plans to change the law

3699001 now things from china often connote poor quality but it was not too long ago that it was the west looking to the east
3699002 blanc de chine reminds us that things produced in china were looked upon by europeans for quality and tasteful design instead of the cheapness that chinese products nowadays are associated with i thought it would be a good aspiration to do something of quality
3699003 had been more craft than art in a certain sense repeating the things that have been handed down for hundreds of years
3699004 at the time when we started blanc de chine garment design had been predominantly visually driven
3699005 we decided to go beyond that and try to explore the other senses whenever applicable
3699006 we take something from the past and look to the future to come up with something for the present
3699007 by recognizing the senses we invoke multidimensional interactions between the body and clothes
3699008 in order to be socially relevant adaptation and modifications are necessary otherwise the clothes become mere costumes
3699009 i dont think i can be competitive coming from the cheap end
3699010 if i were to do that i may as well put my investment in real estate which is more rewarding and less demanding when i first started and was paying attention to the insides of garments as well as the outsides even my son would give me dirty looks and said obviously i was not in the industry i have no sense of cost but i always believed that people would pay for a well designed garment

3699025 since then weve brought her a bike for most birthdays and for every christmas
3699026 she had a passion for riding straight away and we all went on tandem bike ride holidays together
3699027 she was always competing at school and knew this is what she wanted to do as a career
3699028 i used to go out cycling with her but eventually she sacked me

3699033 i am not buying the lie that sacrificing the arctic national wildlife refuge and americas coastal waters to oil drilling would make a real difference in gas prices either today or twenty years from today
3699034 with just three percent of the worlds oil reserves our nation simply doesnt have enough oil to impact the global market or drill our way to lower prices at the pump

3699041 we cant be overcritical of american publishers for cowering under terrorist threats
3699042 after all the guardian like every other british newspaper lacked the gumption to publish the danish cartoons of mohammed but all who care about free speech have a duty to make this sort of censorship counterproductive random house should pay this author substantial compensation and the book should be placed on a website so everyone can read it
3699043 we stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some however a publisher must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house inc booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the book
3699044 frankly im more afraid of global warming than of terrorist attacks
3699045 i did expect my book would be controversial just because im a pink woman writing about a culture that was not my own and a religion that is not my own but my aim was not to provoke it was to portray the difficulty of being a woman in that era and to portray this wonderful heroine who overcame obstacles to become a prominent figure in islam

3699051 we can hardly agree to this as it implies that georgian so called peacekeepers should be in south ossetia georgian peacekeepers cannot be there they committed crimes shooting their own russian colleagues with whom they were serving
3699052 no plans to force anyone from power this is not in our political culture at all
3699053 for all the people who are suffering out there this is good news
3699054 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3699055 the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt

3699067 many modern real estate auctions are nothing more than a bait and switch scheme to lure hopeful buyers to submit offers that can later be accepted or rejected by the lenders sellers despite the general publics perception that once the auctioneer declares sold the property is in fact sold
3699068 but we took care of business so im happy about that

3699101 it may not taste good that doesnt mean its going to make you sick
3699102 theres a big difference between spoilage and whats going to make you sick
3699103 often spoilage bacteria will outgrow the harmful bacteria and protect the food
3699104 even if you put it under the microscope you couldnt tell its salmonella bacteria
3699105 do you know the temperature of your refrigerator most people dont
3699106 about 25 percent of the refrigerators in the country are operating at a temperature that can make food unsafe
3699107 here were using the refrigerator as a food safety device and most people have no clue no idea what temperature it should be
3699108 if its contaminated and then you further abuse it temperature wise then youre at risk
3699109 in heat low levels of contamination can just go really wild
3699110 if you go to a restaurant and then get a doggy bag and then go to a movie
3699111 because it can mean that something else has been growing there
3699112 but if somebody is allergic to mold and you would inhale those molds it may give them an adverse reaction
3699113 you have to realize that everyones perception of spoilage is not the same because all of us have different senses we dont have the same taste smell or even see it the same way
3699114 thats why two people dont always agree some people would eat it other people wont
3699115 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make the ceremonys musical designer

3699118 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go

3699150 there were a number of candidates to sing the song and the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer

3699180 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3699181 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3699182 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3699183 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3699190 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3699191 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3699192 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3699193 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3699194 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3699195 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3699196 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3699261 we certainly were disappointed we didnt make a regional because we thought we were going to get in
3699262 i will say that we made ourselves vulnerable of that decision with some bad mid week losses
3699263 the players understand and realize some of the pressure they put on themselves this past season
3699264 we handled a lot of situations very well but also didnt play well at times with a target on our backs
3699265 theres no question in my opinion that we get in if were in the sec acc or big 12
3699266 im not real sure what exactly kept us out i thought we had done enough things to get in the tournament
3699267 we didnt get in the tournament but in my eyes our 2008 campaign was not a disappointment
3699268 i look at things a little differently such as what our guys did well and how that will springboard them to more success in the future
3699269 i would hope that reyes and others have gotten over what happened last season as theyve had time to relax and work this summer
3699270 you would hope this past season would give our guys great motivation as most of us took exception to the fact we didnt make the postseason
3699271 i think it says what this program is about that we can have a less than stellar year but have such a positive outlook for the next season
3699272 we hold this program to high standards and take pride in having stability

3699279 all our thoughts are with his family at this time
3699280 i always enjoyed drama at school and set up a small theatre company when i was living in orkney
3699281 but apart from that i havent performed in 45 years when i was in three men in a boat
3699282 i found the language very interesting as it moves between medieval and 1930s english and i appreciate the irony of an snp councillor playing an english knight
3699283 weve had very good audiences so far there were more than 80 people there most nights my only concern is that im on the recruitment committee for the new head of planning on thursday and i may not get away in time for the performance
3699284 im not sure you can draw too many connections between us
3699285 we are ideally placed to challenge the world in the fringe
3699286 we have 21 wonderful people performing in murder in the cathedral and every one is essential to its success
3699287 with richard holloway being stabbed in the front rather than in the back as was his wont as becket were looking at a winning combination
3699288 we want to develop the facility into a top quality water sports hub for the city while reducing the carbon footprint of the building
3699289 swimming pools are big energy users so solar heating is definitely the way forward especially with rising fuel prices and the need to cut carbon emissions
3699290 this move is to be commended its exactly the type of green energy project we need to see more of in the city
3699291 all i need is some tasty waves a cool buzz and im fine
3699292 what has come to light is that junior doctors are putting on cremation certification c diff infection when this has not been the cause of death or has been sometime in the past this obviously gives false leading figures as to the prevalence of c diff and can be upsetting to relatives
3699293 obviously where c diff is the cause of death this needs to be recorded thus i would be grateful if consultants could discuss with their junior staff to improve the quality of death certification
3699294 while the paragraph was carefully worded the message was clear and has had the desired effect junior doctors are now afraid to note c diff on certificates for fear of the consequences to their careers
3699295 it is totally unacceptable for junior doctors to be given the impression that they may get into trouble with their employer if c difficile is the cause of death and that is what they put on the death certificate
3699296 its a nasty infection but its quite simple to identify so why there has to be such confusion around whether to list it or not i do not know
3699297 junior doctors are rotated on a regular basis as part of their training with the new intake reporting for duty with nhs lothian last week this note was a reminder for their supervisors
3699298 it is absolutely crucial for everyone patients and their families clinical staff that we get important things like filling out death certificates right
3699299 i think the council is very vulnerable these decisions cannot stand and this could be an incredible outcome as a point of law of this
3699300 the councils financial involvement relates to commercial agreements on property which have been reported openly to the council
3699301 it is routine for public and privately owned land to be taken together for the sake of developments that benefit the city
3699302 we are obliged to raise market value on property we sell and we are comfortable that we have done that
3699303 consider the complaint in the light of the applicable community law
3699304 this training provides police officers and partner agencies with a unique opportunity to learn about the issues surrounding internet and online safety and allows them to pass this knowledge on to schoolchildren and parents alike
3699305 it will allow us to educate young people of the risks associated with the internet
3699306 weve been going into schools for around two years now but we want to expand the number of people who can deliver this advice in schools we already educate youngsters about stranger danger in a public place and the internet is now a public place its part of everyday life this poses a huge problem
3699307 the internet is a very useful resource for our young people but unfortunately it has its dark side with unscrupulous and sometimes evil people trying to exploit youngsters
3699308 it is therefore extremely important that we highlight any risks that may be associated with it to try to protect young people
3699309 i am very thankful that the police have opened out this training course for the councils children and families staff
3699310 lynne would be so proud to see this this would not be happening if it hadnt been for the work lynne put into it
3699311 this is a great success its only a pilot but everything has to start somewhere and im glad we are finally seeing some success after all the work lynne put in
3699312 we were always keen on walking as a family but when we did lynne would be sitting on the pavement crying because she was exhausted and in so much pain
3699313 it has helped of course but none of this would be happening without lynne
3699314 further outbreaks of heavy rain will affect the area giving another 15 mm in three hours in places the public are advised to take extra care and refer to the latest scottish environment protection agency live flood warning information and also to traffic scotland for further advice on road conditions
3699315 the road down there is really bad for accidents there have been motorcyclists knocked off and even killed before
3699316 i was thrilled to bits i watched the television all day yesterday and all day today he had two runs today in the first run he had a two second penalty and he had a brilliant second run which is why he did so well
3699317 she was absolutely thrilled and delighted for david hes been receiving his medal and has been talking to gaby roslin and hes been talking to his family
3699318 davids really far too sensible to hope for anything because he knew better than anybody that anything can happen he was focussed and he was thinking positively and he was well prepared hes spent the last four years working towards it i think hell carry on for 2012 but i dont know
3699319 i put in a good final run there and in the pressure of a big final it is the most exciting time to do it
3699320 it was a bit nerve wracking watching the guys follow i was happy i had done a good run and that was all that i could do a medal is what i have been after for the last four years
3699321 this is by far the biggest competition he has ever won he is capable of holding it together under these big conditions
3699322 i had a party at the golf club today we had several bottles of bubbly and it was very nice
3699323 i knew they were going to come back they always do
3699324 they always have players sneaking their way through in the last minute so i saw it coming but our girls pulled through
3699325 we wanted to beat them really bad especially after the beat us 1 0 in the round robin
3699326 we have a lot of friends on that team so it wasnt too rough or anything it was just a great game
3699327 labrador is a great team and their goals were really nice top shelf goals we have a pretty good team here though we have a lot of strong players from all over the west coast
3699328 we struggled a bit at the end but we didnt fall apart
3699329 we were getting a little worried when it was close to the end of the game and we started to rush a bit
3699330 once we scored the first one we calmed down and managed to get the second one
3699331 overtime can go either way and it was a tough break for us
3699332 it was a great tournament though the game we played them before was so even one goal was just a matter of a lucky break so we knew it would be close again this time
3699333 we were quite happy to come out with third place considering the way it all went down
3699334 we know we only lost out of being in the gold medal game by one goal just a game where we didnt really play bad but just didnt play as well as we could have and were pretty sure we had the best team in the tournament
3699335 i know third place doesnt really say that but we know our boys are top contenders and were happy they came out on top here in the last game
3699336 these guys played fantastic all week and theyre a really easy bunch to coach theyre a tight group
3699337 we played terrible in the first half but we picked it up a lot in the second half
3699338 it was a little hard to get up for the bronze medal game we thought we had a really good chance to win gold so maybe thats why we had a slow start
3699339 we only missed out on the gold medal game by one goal so we came close
3699340 we really believe we were the best team in the tournament
3699341 i wouldnt call them negotiations i would say we are working cooperatively with senator clinton and her staff
3699342 things are going remarkably well and were looking forward to the convention and looking ahead
3699343 well we are hitting them at 65 miles an hour
3699344 theyd say hi this is mitchell im at the cemetery
3699345 if you dont fall for the joke you get to be in on it
3699346 lulz is watching someone lose their mind at their computer 2 000 miles away while you chat with friends and laugh
3699347 you look for someone who is full of it a real blowhard then you exploit their insecurities to get an insane amount of drama laughs and lulz rules would be simple 1 do whatever it takes to get lulz 2 make sure the lulz is widely distributed this will allow for more lulz to be made 3 the game is never over until all the lulz have been had
3699348 i want everyone off the internet bloggers are filth they need to be destroyed blogging gives the illusion of participation to a bunch of retards we need to put these people in the oven
3699349 plankton levels are dropping bees are dying there are tortilla riots in mexico the highest wheat prices in 30 odd years
3699350 the question we have to answer is how do we kill four of the worlds six billion people in the most just way possible
3699351 but i can look at you while youre burning in the fire and not be required to help
3699352 allows me to find people who do stupid things and turn them around zach asked if i thought i could turn my parents around i almost broke down the idea of them learning from their mistakes and becoming people that i could actually be proud of it was overwhelming
3699353 its not that i do this because i hate them i do this because im trying to save them
3699354 they take in so much money but they dont even build something nice for their followers to look at
3699355 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
3699356 monday night we saw many many tired people coming into the cafeteria some with not even enough energy to eat
3699357 when the kids get off the plane and start getting here i think we will see the same big smiles we saw last saturday
3699358 based on the reaction we have been getting from the athletes coaches managers everything so far has been very positive
3699359 talking to one coach last night he said it has been amazing the hospitality the service theyve gotten how friendly everybody are and they say the food has been just beyond reproach
3699360 i think the competition was good from talking to some of the athletes and coaches they have all had a good time and enjoyed it there has been some good laughs and some real good competition in all the sports everything we have heard so far has been positive
3699361 ive been speaking to some of the chairs and they have been telling me everything went so well that they dont think there are many things we will have to change
3699362 with respect to venues there is not a lot to do
3699363 it is just a real tribute to what the city has done we have to do almost nothing
3699364 theyve brought some fantastic facilities with them and the expertise when it comes to athletics
3699365 i am sure they will put off an excellent competition out there
3699366 the volunteers have been absolutely fantastic they have been so pleasant and friendly as they greet the athletes with smiles it is being recognized by the coaches too

3699372 to win it in the bottom of the seventh like that we did a similar thing in grand falls windsor at the provincials
3699373 we started with the tavenor then the provincials and now this one to top it off we dont expect to win the nationals but that will be quite a challenge for the guys at that level theyll see some pitching they havent seen before
3699374 weve been rivals ever since we all started playing baseball so it was great to get the win against them
3699375 they are a good team and gave us a good run for our money but we took it in the end
3699376 it was a really close game and maybe we werent playing our best at the beginning but we got our bats going and started playing as a team
3699377 we played pretty good we had some good hits good fielding and nice defence and i thought we played just as good as corner brook but they managed to pull it out
3699378 at the end of the game we got a few bad calls against us

3699403 the nrp regards the elections as in accordance with the democratic process of cambodia
3699404 in order to keep its sovereignty the nrp would like to declare that it will not make an alliance with the sam rainsy party under any circumstances
3699405 the nrp changed its stance from rejecting to supporting the election results with the aim of helping ranariddh come back to cambodia
3699406 we knew that norodom ranariddh was still the same his stance has never been firm

3699441 dont you think its rather presumptuous of this particular foreign company to question the right of a countrys choice in a certain product maybe its because all these foreign companies just think that its not about choosing but about having a choice and we poor third rate countries havent the brains to think for ourselves

3699576 bound to be the case that theres a quarter or two of negative growth
3699577 the adjustment of the uk economy to higher commodity prices and a more realistic pricing of credit will be painful
3699578 the next year will be a difficult one with inflation high and output broadly flat but with monetary policy focused on its task of bringing inflation back to the target we will come through the adjustment
3699579 and we will return if not to the nice decade then at least one that as central bankers say is not so bad

3699591 the results of this study are very encouraging and could change the way breast cancer patients are treated the good news is the two treatments used in this study are relatively inexpensive and already used in the clinic therefore we should quickly see the benefits of giving women the best possible chance of beating breast cancer

3699664 that any tactical or technical analysis of this match is useless
3699665 we have learnt a lot from our first match actually we will be competing with very strong opponents we are pleased of our first victory we based our game on teamwork and the players should play always as a team in the first set we didnt in future matches we should play as in the last sets
3699666 the hardest thing is to play a game when you are the clear favourite this is our first game playing against algeria they know how to play volleyball because most of the players are playing in france so we knew we had to concentrate especially when we are playing at such as early hour
3699667 we have continued to play good volleyball and have won again like our match with russia we played with attention good defence and few mistakes and we did so for nearly the entire match
3699668 aguero came back and she has participated in training sessions of course she is facing difficulties psychological and physical because she has spent so much time on planes and is very tired but she is recovering her rhythm and balance quickly
3699669 of course i am happy to win we did very well we played with concentration and consistency but its just the second round of play we have to keep working and do it step by step its very important
3699670 we played well from the beginning till the end we concentrated very well throughout the match

3699703 instead of two to three days of hospitalization and two months of recuperation typical with open prostate surgery robotic surgery patients often go home the next day and resume normal activities within two weeks
3699704 i have seen the number of robotic prostatectomies increase among our patient population over the past couple of years and the benefits are quite clear
3699705 these surgeries result in fewer immediate complications and quicker recovery than in an open procedure especially in the hands of a skilled surgeon who performs a high volume of cases routinely
3699706 the clubs have both reached an agreement but there are also other teams interested apart from roma fenerbahce are one of those sides
3699707 well see what happens we will try and meet with the club in the next few days

3699710 there is speculation around the club and that has been prevalent since i joined the club
3699711 from my own point of view i am very focused on what i am about and what i aim to achieve here and that means success on the pitch
3699712 nothing whatsoever has changed in that respect and the football operation hasnt changed since i signed for the club
3699713 nor has my relationship with garry cook the clubs executive chairman and his team we get on really well and continue to speak on a daily basis
3699714 i am the guy that makes the decisions in relation to the football and they make the decisions in relation to the running of the club

3699717 in a year when the playing field is stacked enormously in favor of the democrats and obama this is an issue that seems to help republicans and theyre trying to make the most of it
3699718 republicans are trying to keep the issue alive because it works for them and the data suggests that the issue is working
3699719 have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas we can do that we can have a vote on that
3699720 theres clearly a lot at play right now and its hard to predict what votes we actually may see in the fall but what were focused on in august is having our folks in districts talking to their about why drilling is not a useful enterprise
3699721 people are so scared right now that theyre not really seeing a choice they want to do anything that might have an impact on gas prices

3699727 mediasentry s actions are analogous to a private citizen going to a public library and reading materials in the librarys collection
3699728 the army and security forces will not be terrorised by attacks and crimes that target it and civil society and the history of the army attests to that
3699729 staunchly denounced the criminal attack that killed many innocent civilians
3699730 the hands of the criminals have hit in tripoli against innocent soldiers and civilians

3699742 we had come out firing in the first match and we gained a lot of confidence today it is tough to beat a team that plays so confidently
3699743 see both of are professionals and we know what to do
3699744 not very big but there is going to be a lot of smoke damage

3699748 how sick is nigerian president umaru yaradua in may he admitted during a live television broadcast that he suffers from a kidney ailment but sought to quell rumors that he was terminally ill by insisting that fears for his health are greatly exaggerated and politically motivated
3699749 with the fall of nigerias dictatorship and the introduction of democracy in 1999 governors in the mainly muslim northern provinces believed they had struck a deal with their southern counterparts on a regional rotation of the countrys presidency
3699750 obasanjo found a compromise he named a man he trusted yaradua a little known northern governor and devout muslim as his preferred successor
3699751 with so many challenges ahead nigeria can ill afford an ailing president
3699752 yaraduas health worries are creating risks to nigerias stability that run far beyond questions about the niger delta or any single political issue
3699753 only umaru yaraduas doctors know for sure how sick he is but as answers begin to emerge we will learn much more about the health of nigerias fragile democracy

3699758 all display some sense of impending pandemonium either real or imagined all the artists or songs here reveal some level of inner tension that manifests itself in the form of all sorts of batty symptoms from low level teeth grinding to full on howling at the moon midnight dancing songs on the edge of a nervous breakdown basically
3699759 after the game our teams went to have their punch and cookies and kay and i stayed in the hallway and talked basketball we were both coaching a couple of teams in addition to teaching classes at our schools i said you know i really liked your inbounds play we started talking a little bit and we realized quickly that we kind of saw this coaching thing a little differently than the people who were coaching and teaching and doing the other stuff
3699760 i remember one year because there were so few teams to play that we kept getting invited to the same places to play volleyball
3699761 he didnt think she would be able to control me
3699762 just a few months after i was hired willis called the two of us into his office and said i have two titles head womens basketball coach and coordinator of womens athletics
3699763 kay said ill be the womens basketball coach he said ok nora lynn you will be the coordinator of athletics do you have any questions
3699764 i had some but i knew better than to ask them
3699765 its been an emotional thing to even think about leaving after 31 years at nc state
3699766 since this was announced i have spent a lot of time with the people i have gotten to know here and answering the phone calls and e mails i received
3699767 but i had to wait until the evenings to pack my things it was just too hard to carry things out of my office and bump into people in the hallways i have known and worked with for so long
3699768 the list of reasons nora lynn is the right fit for the conference office is extensive and certainly includes her history and national involvement with womens basketball
3699769 i cant say enough about her passion and drive when it comes to athletics and specifically womens athletics
3699770 she understands the landscape of athletics and has strong relationships within the league and across the country
3699771 in addition to her contributions to nc state nora lynn has been a great steward for the acc and the ncaa throughout her career
3699772 when you work with someone for 31 years you kind of expect them to always be there i am of course saddened by it but we are all happy for her and her new opportunity
3699773 things are better at nc state than they ever have been in the 31 years i have been here things are set and in good order
3699774 the golf course is about to open both our golf teams are benefitting from the short game practice facility we built three years ago
3699775 mens soccer is playing on a new field and i am excited about the possibilities for that program playing at a stadium in the center of the campus reynolds coliseum just received a wonderful facelift and kay is energized and ready for next year i just believe things are good here
3699776 up until that period of time when she became the administrator for golf i never felt unfairly treated but the answer to most questions was more often than not was no
3699777 her answer after that was lets see if we cant figure out a way to get that done
3699778 i remember our golf team had never flown anywhere that was a big deal for us when forest and duke were flying right over the top of us while we were riding in that van all night long the first week nora lynn was there we got permission to fly somewhere it was a like a light bulb came on somewhere ever since that time she has done everything possible to try to elevate our golf program if we havent reached the heights we should have reached its certainly not her fault
3699779 when i first heard that nora lynn was leaving i was at the beach at an annual family outing
3699780 my brother in law jeff elliott the acc associate commissioner and director of finance and administration was there and i told him i didnt know if i should congratulate him or kick him
3699781 nora lynn has been a great mentor to me because she is so good at what she does she is leaving a great body of work and a great legacy for the university
3699782 the main reason she made a difference here was that she always had time for the players
3699783 they could always stop by her office and she would always stop what she was doing and take the time to talk and listen to them the personal touch that she put into the job is something all of our former players appreciated because she always put the needs of the student athlete first
3699784 nora lynn has devoted much of her career to championing the student athletes coaches and programs not only at nc state but in the acc and the ncaa
3699785 he has certainly done a great job of during her tenure with nc state but her reach has always been larger than just one team or one program

3699806 its not money that they would be making working as a waiter they get well compensated its better than beer money im in my mid 40s and my generation has a stigma about porn the kids the generation of the student athletes dont have that stigma they really dont care theyve come from a paris hilton tommy lee pamela anderson sex tape generation myspace pages the shame and stigma arent there for them theyre mostly worried about what their parents are going to think because their parents think its horrifying
3699807 strike fear in his heart for himself his family property and livelihood
3699808 assure councilman perkins and the unfortunate people who are related to him that i represent no threat to their personal safety
3699809 im just going to make fun of him until he cannot take it anymore

3699814 to store and manage information about their location and offers developers clear protocols for updating or accessing that information because its open any networked service can use fire eagle to respond to a users location to help them find their friends annotate the world or find nearby services or local information
3699815 the reason for this is that we must put our countrys interest first
3699816 but the fact is that seriously no one cares about the quality of their code they do for some american company which they dont know much about
3699817 some support work or very monotonous and boring development work that looks like it will take ages to get completed
3699818 hated the score the animation the shots the characters and most of all the retarded idiot story
3699819 our experience from over 10 years of gm cultivation shows that gm technology has been found to deliver real environmental and economic benefits
3699820 at a time when demand for food and fuel is rising and in the face of growing environmental challenges we need to find ways to feed an ever increasing global population
3699821 the application of advanced science in breeding new crop varieties including genetic modification methods cannot alone address these massive challenges but they can be a major part of the solution
3699822 even for a prince whos a long established champion of organic farming and critic of gm crops these are comments which verge on the extreme
3699823 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3699824 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3699825 that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3699826 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3699827 as we have said many times there is an important debate to be had on the potential role of gm crops in the future and we welcome all voices in that debate
3699828 safety will always be our top priority on this issue
3699829 prince charles is quickly making his position as heir to the throne untenable with his meddling in politics
3699830 it appears the uc is attempting to secularize private religious schools
3699831 confirms that uc may apply the same admissions standards to all students and to all high schools without regard to their religious affiliations
3699832 any instance of gods guidance of history or any alternative to evolution
3699833 instructs that the bible is the unerring source for analysis of historical events
3699834 if scientific conclusions contradict the word of god the conclusions are wrong
3699835 we evaluate the courses to see whether they prepare these kids to come to college at uc
3699836 there was no evidence that these students were in fact denied the ability to come to the university
3699837 if it comes from certain publishers or from a religious perspective uc simply denies them
3699838 its a beautiful day all the kids are here everybodys excited
3699839 we all thought that this would be up and running by now but it looks like the state budget mess has put this off for another year
3699840 i think a lot of physicians in the medical care community are waiting to see what the rates will be
3699841 the package is designed to keep people from going to the emergency room
3699842 people are no longer going on vacation you have teachers back in school there is a lot more that rolls into that percentage than students
3699843 dragging two people in one car as opposed to 20 people on a bus yeah definitely
3699844 and having to depend on somebody else to get you places its not as freeing
3699845 anything but the one parent and one child in one car going one block
3699846 we anticipate full buses by the third or fourth day of school
3699847 my angst is that we are going to see more kids riding buses than we expected
3699848 the fact is these fees dont come anywhere near what it costs the district to run the system
3699849 it creates this constant conflict of using school funds for buses or books and buses will always lose
3699850 our worst fear is that this transition will take peoples focus off the momentum that is occurring at the hospital
3699851 being a hospital ceo is challenging the healthcare environment in sonoma county and everywhere is rugged
3699852 sooner is always better because then your team is complete
3699853 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been scattered
3699854 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them

3699864 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3699865 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual

3699867 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3699868 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3699869 the magnitude of the dollars moves and the breaking of key technical levels suggest that a major shift in the outlook towards the dollar is occurring as massive positions are adjusted
3699870 if you take out the canadian teams which have done so well since the lockout largely because of the canadian dollar the leagues revenues are actually only growing at a 2 per cent clip per year

3699875 if you can get your neighborhood groups to band together and share a common goal and look out for one another in a cooperative fashion its more effective than the fire department knocking on the door
3699876 one of our greatest concerns here at the fire department is if theres a fire up there it would have the potential to do more damage to the city than any type of fire scenario i could imagine
3699877 ive seen a lot of activity around these parts since she started
3699878 to make it work it has to be a community effort we need it for everybody to get involved

3699881 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent
3699882 i have at all times tried to fair and honest with the students the faculty the staff and the community
3699883 at all times i have done what i have felt was in the best interests of the high school
3699884 dr sullivan will long be remembered in gloucester for the many individual families he helped over the past 10 years i wish him all the best in his retirement
3699885 the main news is that after a protracted period of discussion weve come to an agreement on a slightly different approach
3699886 if you dont have everybody on board and theres controversy you could do more harm than good
