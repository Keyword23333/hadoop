310000 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
310001 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
310002 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
310003 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
310004 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
310005 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
310006 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
310007 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
310008 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
310009 i hope chinese media enhance the report of chinese traditional culture
310010 they can only make a small difference at the margins
310011 it was as though he was running for an ohio senate seat
310012 we cant find any evidence in our recent polling that the vice president made a significant difference
310013 people ultimately see the promises and the voice coming from one person
310014 the choice can shape how a presidential nominee is perceived
310015 signaled what kind of a chief executive officer he was going to be
310016 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
310017 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
310018 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
310019 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
310020 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
310021 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
310022 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
310023 war is the supreme test of man in which he rises to heights never approached in any other activity
310024 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
310025 you know gas prices are high when texans start driving golf carts
310026 part of a growing internet subculture with a fluid morality and a disdain for pretty much everyone else online
310027 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
310028 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
310029 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
310030 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
310031 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
310032 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
310033 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
310034 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
310035 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
310036 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
310037 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
310038 its t boone pickens different political party different persuasion than al saying weve got to move to renewables
310039 the democrats want to just do the renewable energy without additional production additional supply and chalk it up as a victory
310040 distorted t boone pickens words when he said we cant drill ourselves out of this problem
310041 he didnt mean we shouldnt be drilling and finding what we can
310042 he just said we need to do all these things
310043 it helps underscore why we believe gaining grass roots support for the pickens plan has been so successful and is such an integral part going forward
310044 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
310045 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
310046 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
310047 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
310048 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
310049 the main we reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
310050 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
310051 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
310052 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
310053 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
310054 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
310055 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
310056 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
310057 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
310058 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
310059 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
310060 integrated into a mainstream investment process in a way that enhances profitability
310061 an inconvenient truth the planetary emergency of global warming and what we can do about it
310062 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
310063 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
310064 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
310065 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
310066 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
310067 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
310068 sounds like a gimmick to take advantage of this phony baloney scheme that al gore hatched to fill his own pockets with
310069 stick it on the tailpipe of every car out there
310070 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
310071 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
310072 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
310073 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
310074 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
310075 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
310076 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
310077 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
310078 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
310079 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
310080 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
310081 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
310082 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
310083 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
310084 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
310085 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
310086 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
310087 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
310088 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
310089 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
310090 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
310091 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
310092 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
310093 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
310094 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
310095 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
310096 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
310097 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
310098 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
310099 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
310100 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
310101 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
310102 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
310103 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
310104 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
310105 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
310106 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
310107 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
310108 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
310109 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
310110 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
310111 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
310112 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
310113 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
310114 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
310115 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
310116 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
310117 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
310118 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
310119 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
310120 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
310121 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
310122 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
310123 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
310124 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
310125 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
310126 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
310127 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
310128 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
310129 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
310130 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
310131 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
310132 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
310133 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
310134 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
310135 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
310136 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
310137 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
310138 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
310139 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
310140 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
310141 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
310142 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
310143 there is not much that evangelicals have in common with the policies promoted by barack obama
310144 despite his best efforts to court people of faith voters understand the difference between lip service and public service and john mccains record is much more in line with the values of the evangelical community
310145 one thing that it clearly is indicative of this poll is that this nation cares about the christian values and ethics of a candidate for national office and it makes enough difference that the news media reports on it
310146 people of faith have always been involved in the political process they have a patriotic and scriptural obligation to do so it is to be ignored at the candidates peril
310147 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
310148 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
310149 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
310150 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
310151 the arctic ocean is warming up icebergs are growing scarcer in some places and the seals are finding the water too hot
310152 today i challenge our nation to commit itself to becoming 100 apple users within the next ten years
310153 ask not what ford can do for you ask what gm product you can buy
310154 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
310155 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
310156 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
310157 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
310158 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
310159 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
310160 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
310161 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
310162 hes got the emmy the oscar hes a nobel laureate why would he want to go back to that
310163 her favorite scene is me running naked covered in blood down a corridor with a chain saw in my hand she doesnt really understand why everyone found it so controversial
310164 i dont know an actor just tries to figure out a role
310165 i think too much is put into saving celebrities and we need do more about saving animals we need rehab for animals
310166 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
310167 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
310168 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
310169 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
310170 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
310171 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
310172 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
310173 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
310174 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
310175 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
310176 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
310177 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
310178 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life
310179 the survival of the united states of america as we know it
310180 the tendency to offer old solutions to each crisis separately without taking the others into account
310181 when we look at all three of these seemingly intractable challenges at the same time we can see the common thread running through them our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three
310182 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures that are needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
310183 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year
310184 and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
310185 the quickest cheapest most efficient and best way to start using all of this renewable energy is in the production of electricity
310186 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
310187 it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
310188 get us off oil make us energy independent invest in clean energy and create a new generation of high quality green collar jobs
310189 one more rustbowl outpost that crawled out of the wrong side of the 1980s
310190 our families cant stand 10 more years of gasoline price increases
310191 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
310192 the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
310193 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
310194 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
310195 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
310196 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
310197 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
310198 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
310199 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
310200 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
310201 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
310202 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
310203 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
310204 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
310205 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
310206 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
310207 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
310208 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
310209 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
310210 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
310211 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
310212 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
310213 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
310214 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
310215 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
310216 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
310217 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
310218 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
310219 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
310220 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
310221 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
310222 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
310223 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
310224 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
310225 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
310226 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
310227 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
310228 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
310229 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
310230 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
310231 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
310232 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
310233 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
310234 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
310235 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
310236 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
310237 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
310238 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
310239 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
310240 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
310241 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
310242 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
310243 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
310244 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
310245 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
310246 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
310247 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
310248 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
310249 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
310250 even coal has a role to play if the carbon dioxide is captured and safely buried but clean coal does not exist right now
310251 but we cannot do the job with renewable and efficiency alone
310252 an expanded role for nuclear energy as well as natural gas and clean coal with carbon capture and storage
310253 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
310254 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
310255 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
310256 climate change and energy security are not just threats they are opportunities
310257 we need to change the debate in this country from what we cant do to what we can do
310258 a new political environment in this country that will allow the next president to do what i think the next president is going to think is the right thing to do
310259 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on
310260 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
310261 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
310262 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
310263 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
310264 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
310265 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
310266 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
310267 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
310268 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
310269 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
310270 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
310271 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
310272 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
310273 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
310274 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
310275 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
310276 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
310277 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
310278 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
310279 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
310280 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
310281 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
310282 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
310283 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
310284 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
310285 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
310286 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
310287 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
310288 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
310289 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
310290 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
310291 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
310292 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
310293 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
310294 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
310295 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
310296 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
310297 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
310298 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
310299 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
310300 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
310301 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
310302 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
310303 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
310304 i like jerry but i think a new ceo is needed
310305 i fear giving it to my children directly unless i boil it
310306 iraq is on the cusp of a serious water crisis that requires immediate attention and resources
310307 up to now we have seen nothing from the government
310308 i had fever headaches and was throwing up all the time
310309 when i was a kid it was blue and clean
310310 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
310311 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
310312 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
310313 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
310314 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
310315 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
310316 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
310317 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
310318 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
310319 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
310320 a source close to amazon with direct knowledge of the numbers
310321 it is not crazy to suggest that life actually started on mars and found its way to earth
310322 the new york times give you the lowdown on ten things that you shouldnt bother worrying about on your vacation
310323 no matter how guilty you feel about your carbon footprint you dont have to swelter on the highway to the beach after doing tests at 65 miles per hour the mileage experts at edmunds com report that the aerodynamic drag from opening the windows cancels out any fuel savings from turning off the air conditioner
310324 john mccain doesnt tell us what we hope to hear beautiful words cannot make our lives better
310325 who can you thank for rising prices at the pump
310326 do you feel that thrill running up your leg yet
310327 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
310328 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
310329 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
310330 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
310331 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
310332 a city really none of us were comfortable walking in the streets to one that was basically safe
310333 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military
310334 oh well i didnt see it i think its kinda stupid
310335 im just too old hat for it in fact the other two i didnt even know who they were i knew who paris hilton was but then there were other two young girls
310336 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
310337 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
310338 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
310339 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
310340 how can this possibly be how can josephs brothers have acted freely and responsibly if what they did was what god had previously ordained how can pilate and herod and judas and the jewish people be properly blamed fror what god had predestined to take place how can god govern the choices of human beings without that entailing that those choices are no longer free how can the same event have two complete explanations
310341 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
310342 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
310343 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
310344 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
310345 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
310346 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
310347 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
310348 we cannot do the job with renewables and energy efficiency alone
310349 we have to have a balanced energy portfolio that includes all those things in even higher percentages but also has to include nuclear and we frankly think that nuclear should be increased
310350 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
310351 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
310352 its a very aggressive bold comprehensive proposal and its great to challenge the politicians to go where they need to go
310353 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
310354 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
310355 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on
310356 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
310357 former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
310358 we cannot do the job with renewables and energy efficiency alone we have to have a balanced energy portfolio that includes all those things in even higher percentages but also has to include nuclear and we frankly think that nuclear should be increased
310359 the vice presidents main effort is to mobilize the american people behind meaningful action and less talk about global warming
310360 its a very aggressive bold comprehensive proposal and its great to challenge the politicians to go where they need to go
310361 none of us can walk away from this issue without agreeing with him that we do have a very serious problem and its only going to get worse unless we do something about it i hope to be a part of that and i would like to see the free market take the lead not the government
310362 it pointed out that the only way we have a chance to drive down oil prices is if we become free of the slavery of oil if we can give americans choices of electrical cars or biodiesel cars then and only then do we have a chance of dealing with this cost issue that is why 4 a gallon gas is not an enemy of action its an ally of action
310363 babae babae now i see it well dont you see god himself is doing this
310364 people people dont you see god loving star hes taking her to live with him
310365 look at me im an old man pretty soon im going to die too and im going there
310366 please please wont you follow gods trail too coming to gods place star and i will be waiting there to welcome you
310367 you know its not about you its about your country
310368 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
310369 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
310370 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
310371 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
310372 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
310373 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
310374 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
310375 you are all seriously the best support team of all time i love you all so much
310376 but i do not encourage any of you to send in photos of yourselves in support of me it will prompt people to write even more articles implying that i have encouraged or inspired young girls to expose themselves in support of me
310377 that is the last thing i want your intention behind it is so sweet but im urging you not to go ahead with the project
310378 unless these sailors stay in the ship you cannot be saved
310379 we are honored to be involved with aafes in bringing our digital technology installed in many of the movie theaters in their hometown
310380 together with aafes and sony pictures these well deserving troops in kuwait will see hancock days before the movie receives its first showing to the hollywood community thousands of miles away los angeles
310381 i think were all political in a way what has happened recently in my case is that fortunately ive been able to get more in touch with the things i can change and do
310382 some movies you fall a step behind and some you stay in the same place make the same choices
310383 i like you for what you are and i want you to be in my picture
310384 the only child of a stylist father and a runway show producer mother the french born ulliel grew up around the parisian fashion world but did not give much thought to his own creative pursuits until age 11 when a family friend provided his entree into film
310385 she was opening an agency for young actors and asked me to join
310386 im 5 foot 7 and ive got pasty white skin i dont think im ugly dont get me wrong but im not your classic lead man brad pitt guy
310387 i hear about actors who become the role and i think i wonder what that feels like because for me theyre all me i relate to these characters because aspects of their personality are like me and i just turn up the parts of myself that are them and turn down the parts that arent
310388 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
310389 im doing women now which i never thought i would be saying
310390 i imagine it will soon be adopted from everyone from barack obama to barbara bush
310391 i dont want to go to a club and not wear panties
310392 then when i cut my hair short my career tanked for about four years
310393 i wake up in the middle of the night and i think im being filmed
310394 we are looking for people above the age of 16 who have naturally coloured hair
310395 we would prefer girls with long hair and men with natural styles extras will get to dress up in victorian period costume corsets and wigs and will have their make up done
310396 we would also like people whose work allows the flexibility of two weeks worth of filming
310397 being an extra is not just about being a blur in the background it can lead to fantastic opportunities one of my extras has now gone on to produce his own film and another went on to star in hollyoaks for three years
310398 there will be at least 100 crew on set and itll be a wonderful experience to be a part of a big movie itll be well paid and hopefully a hugely enjoyable experience
310399 the locations chosen in plymouth had just the right feel for the needs of the film
310400 our primary role is to attract productions to come to film in this region and were absolutely delighted to attract such a big production to the south west
310401 the barbican has the highest concentration of cobbled streets in the country and mount edgcumbe has one of the finest landscaped gardens in the country so these are possibilities
310402 in fact the italian garden there would be perfect for a mad hatters tea party and there is also a fine orangery
310403 funnily enough i was at the royal william last night thinking what a fantastic location it would make for filming too as it is so untouched and secluded
310404 any filming in a town brings three levels of benefits
310405 i want to live fast love hard die young and leave a beautiful memory

310429 you know if this guy was out of baseball thats a bit different he was in the outfield for a long time hes obviously not going to be the same junior he was in the 90s but i dont think he should have any problems
310430 these guys have done a great job and i just want to help them get to a common goal and thats winning a title
310431 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around

310435 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
310436 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder

310450 what we decided to do is find the top three international celebrities in the world and i would say from our indications britney and paris came in second and third
310451 will people think of this as negative advertising look it is the most entertaining thing i have seen on tv in a while
310452 it is not our campaign that is trying to make him into an international celebrity its his campaign i dont know paris hilton and britney spears but they are international celebrities so you know apples to apples
310453 a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men
310454 how to stop high speed police chases suicidal bridge jumpers and save money too
310455 its a continuation of the trend weve been seeing moderate job declines overall and increases in total unemployment

310458 the fcc has inexplicably elevated the interests of a few bandwidth hogs over everyone else
310459 we have the authority to protect consumers access to the internet
310460 it will send a public signal that phone and cable companies cant interfere in internet traffic
310461 the fcc is poised for massive unprecedented regulation of the internet
310462 this dangerous path would limit freedom stifle innovation and entrepreneurship and kill american jobs
310463 secretly degrading innovative protocols used for transporting and sharing large files like high quality television programming and movies
310464 ha ha ha barack obama this is not good folks
310465 people who want a lease will have to pay much more attention
310466 theyll need to crunch numbers harder and make sure it still makes sense
310467 youre going to see a pretty significant shift of people who used to lease purchasing those vehicles and holding on to them for a long time

310475 to me it actually makes more sense than using second life as a hiring tool if the point is to find an avatar based environment for interviews something simple and web based seems well simpler than a richer environment that requires a download the lack of integrated voice in lively though could present problems

310491 but the driving engine of our economy is energy and they have not acted on that
310492 but as they come back after their recess and realize that this is something that they really ought to do that could go a long way to try to help improve our economic outlook

310494 if it is part of an overarching package then i am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem

310527 someone may say that misdemeanor violations should not be a priority but there is a very real possibility they could go out and commit a more serious offense that has heartbreaking consequences for the community
310528 what if a person who has a dui conviction gets behind the wheel several months from now and has an accident that claims the life of several innocent victims why would we allow that to happen

310548 our hope is that people will build friendships through this and we already have begun to see that
310549 we have a list of literally hundreds of issues facing people when this happens
310550 there are all sorts of medical and financial issues to deal with we offer help for the caregiver and help for the family it also gives people the chance to come in and see what assisted living centers are like and know that if they do have family members there they are in good hands
310551 almost everyone in our company has gone through an issue like this where weve had to deal with a parent who was aging

310553 the more it sells the more awareness on drug and alcohol addiction and the more money it will raise for

310555 there is an albums worth of songs already written for a soundtrack to the book ready to record id say its very 70s glam sounding bits remind me of bowie and t rex with a darker edge to the melodies and lyrics
310556 things like software that prevent kids from going to specific sites are great theres also software to limit kids in terms of how much internet they use thats great but i think the more important thing is the parents really need to get involved in their childrens lives

310558 he had some soreness so we went and got some more mris theyve come up fine so we thought we might even put a needle in and have a look at it to see if we were missing anything and we werent
310559 because he hasnt been active hes got some built up scar tissue there and soreness around it
310560 he was pretty taken back on monday with the pain but i think hes in much better spirits now and hes accepting what it is and trying to push through it
310561 the novel captures the plight of millions of americans whose lives had been crushed by the dust bowl and the great depression and its topics are as relevant in todays global culture and economy as they were then
310562 we havent rejected it we have replied and asked for a clarification about how that proposal was reached and where it goes
310563 todds manager david riolo has sent through a response in regards to the clubs proposal and out of good faith the board has agreed to look at this response before a final decision is made on todds future
310564 after the match against the broncos the board will discuss the response and will aim to make a decision on monday

310575 if youre going to make out with someone on stage i better be the one you make out with
310576 yes lets top that off with a drunken brawl at the governors ball and make everyones fantasies come true
310577 marcias going to make out with felicity if she wins the emmy
310578 because everyone loves lipstick lesbos in hollywood and we just arent notorious enough
310579 im totally jazzed to be part of the marcia cross carnival of confused sexuality at long last
310580 speaking of lesbians is that the girl from buffy singing fame
310581 what does buffy and thats the girl from veronica mars eva have to do with lesbians
310582 isnt that kind of a lesbian show like you know xena or battlestar galactica you know the shows real geeks watch
310583 oh yay queer america has a new and staunch defender
310584 be nice about battlestar galactica its the critical darling of the week and plus i bet they nominate mary mcdonnell next year just so they can talk about how fiftysomethings like her and new housewife and former costar alfre woodard are the new trend and make us fortysomething housewives look passe
310585 and glenn is nominated for the cop show because she was good in it
310586 come on this town loves name recognition or did we miss the part where blythe danner won for a show nobody on earth watches
310587 its very underrated hank is great in it blythe too
310588 also nobody answered my question about the girl from buffy
310589 her name is kristen bell and shes not from buffy
310590 and she will win an emmy before you do eva
310591 there should be lots of booze at awards shows so you dont think fuck it im going to announce i am queen gay and i plan to convert all the good christian women of middle america starting with eva
310592 save it for the globes itll be much more fun there you can claim you did too many tequila shots before your acceptance speech
310593 and then marc can have another heart attack while the publicists and lawyers cover our collective ass
310594 nobody cares about anything except what were wearing who wins the major categories and if the five of us will have a fight because i hear we dont really get along
310595 well no they want to see you and marcia fight
310596 the rest of us are just set dressing for your titanic war of good versus evil like how everyone only watches real world to see whos going to have a threesome and whos going to get kicked out
310597 i dont understand why nobody worries if felicity and marcia will have a fight if felicity wins and marcia loses
310598 thats just how it is youre the dumb sexpot teri is the superstar im the washed up bimbo with a second chance marcias the gay bitch and felicity is the one with class whos slumming
310599 good luck girls and just remember next year that thing is mine
310600 and remember if you win you have to kiss me first
310601 five shows you always wanted to do a guest spot on
310602 you were on x files back when you banged duchovny for two weeks so you dont need the cult street cred
310603 okay um the simpsons of course though really i would have liked to do futurama and be space cadet felicity
310604 maybe we should send a pa to get you coffee before you start bitchslapping people
310605 so we have melrose whatever the simpsons or is that replaced by futurama
310606 but only if we could go on it together as a couple
310607 why not weeds would that sully our images as americas favorite housewives
310608 i dont buy for a second you watch that much tv
310609 really i wouldnt mind doing any pay cable show or cartoons id like to do cartoons so that the girls will have shows they can watch me on occasionally
310610 you know eva originally asked me this question because eva would love to be on the amazing race
310611 i knew you never came up with a question like that yourself you are not that fond of television
310612 i make tv so i dont have to watch it
310613 but voyeurism does have a rather pervy element doesnt it
310614 but youre not going to let me give you any are you
310615 dont take more than two of em at a time
310616 and if you do take five of em at bedtime with water on a full stomach itll take longer but you wont feel it look like your heart stopped
310617 im sorry that danna used her access to videotape the pilots lounge
310618 when do we get the hard hitting documentary about colonial one
310619 i knew biers would end up supporting the military anyone who knows the men and women of galactica knows the job youre doing
310620 what does god want me to do what shall i do madam president shall i kiss you and wait for you to rise from the tomb
310621 really i can see how you would have been a great beauty a decade ago but beauty fades my dear madam president may i call you laura now after all you died in my arms so we are close enough to drop the pretense
310622 five years ago even you would have been irresistible there would have been no command you could have made that i wouldnt have obeyed as you know i tend to be rather woman crazy women are so much more beautiful than men and i suspect rather the wiser at that
310623 honestly laura you cant keep lying there and not expect me to think of it
310624 you are still practically viable and i have been madly copulating with air that speaks like a beautiful blonde drag queen with her arse in the air
310625 after all i am the only one who can keep your secret
310626 and none of my inner voices are saying this isnt what gods will is really i might have to take your silence as assent
310627 once upon a time when i lived in caprica city when i was prettier
310628 oh gods its been years since ive well done much of anything i suppose anything except work long grey days of work after my mother died
310629 captain apollo are you trying to tell me what i want to hear
310630 i dont need someone to soothe my regrets and most certainly im not asking you to do that
310631 back when i still had lovers and still danced would do my dancing before social events in corridors in back rooms and often in the kitchen while the cooks were setting up because it would be the only area where there was a wireless he would never dance with me where people could see and now i do regret that because it wouldnt have mattered in the end
310632 my father had to ask you to dance on colonial day
310633 and i am out of practice your father knows all the correct responses hed never let a lady sit alone especially not an ally he respected
310634 is there a reason were talking to each other in riddles
310635 metaphors about dancing a loaded conversation about your relationship with my father and the unanswered question of why at this moment we are discussing dance as though it was a serious thing
310636 for the sake of my sanity and limited dancing abilities can you tell me what the enigma is
310637 our relationship we are talking about our relationship captain adama
310638 i forget sometimes how very young you can be and that you have inherited your fathers remarkable ability to be blind to the obvious in cases of impropriety
310639 perhaps you have nothing to say or nothing honest that you could say to me under the circumstances
310640 you told me not to tell you what you wanted to hear
310641 you dont have the slightest clue about yourself do you lee
310642 you are young and idealistic and honest but its all a front you dont know what you really want besides to be loved and approved of and youll chase any path to fill that hole inside of you
310643 when it comes right down to it laura roslin every time i have made a sacrifice followed a path done the hard thing it has been for you and speaking of dangerous what about you why have i abandoned my duty broken the law and betrayed my fathers trust for you why do i follow you
310644 of all the men in the fleet why is the one i trust most implicitly the dashing young hero commander adamas son
310645 i do believe in you whether or not i believe in the arrow of apollo i believe in you
310646 you realize that right im not going to make you a man or stop you from being the dutiful son or save your soul i am dying and i am terrified and i have the future of the entire human race resting on my shoulders dont make me responsible for your salvation too
310647 do you think that you can handle it in the end you cant save me i cant save you and theres no future this is not what you want
310648 so what does your god need a blonde bimbo sexbot model for anyway
310649 do you really think god pays so much attention to physical beauty
310650 perhaps im here to get the fickle and shallow to pay attention
310651 i mean cant he just show up and command people why would he need a pretty girl
310652 would you be quite so brazen if that wasnt the expectation starbuck the bold one the big mouth playboy the kind of girl who would frak a toaster just for the thrill before popping it in the mouth and taking it home to daddy
310653 i suppose for all the praying horny people do oh frak do that again
310654 know that youre all turned on by my squishy human body and my squishy human breasts
310655 bet you can feel it right in your clit cant you increased pulse rise in temperature and youre gods servant right
310656 if you really wanted to frak me i wouldnt have said no
310657 do you really have any idea who i am or how easy it was to kill you
310658 reaching beyond your blog using social networking sites and twitter
310659 and i rather like the notion of being made love to by a god
310660 and here i thought all little girls dreamed of princes
310661 but im not a little girl so i can dream larger than that
310662 you look flushed again i think you need to talk to the doc about this
310663 it seems my preferred way to handle stress with good old fashioned dissociation
310664 i know the feeling ive been having very intense dreams lately
310665 its been a long week what about you i imagine cottles got you on a few medicines and rest schedule too should you be up this late
310666 i really should have woken you but you sleep hard
310667 well if youre ready i maybe could go for a little breakfast
310668 well have it delivered and we can discuss this situation with the hybridizing plants that can produce o2 and foodstuffs
310669 theres no real trouble with us walking to the galleys i promise im not that ill
310670 but its no trouble to go to the mess hall like everyone else it shows some unity wouldnt you say
310671 anyway i will see you soon thank you for breakfast
310672 you have a little squeak to your voice when you get tired
310673 said he was on his way back to his quarters
310674 and tigh didnt know i was aboard bill im enjoying our lengthy visits but you locked me in your room
310675 must have been an unconscious gesture i tend to keep the door locked i didnt think youd be awake yet
310676 you locked me in your room because you thought i wouldnt wake up
310677 i was here for a consultation with cottle that was all i have work to do
310678 madam president do you think id forgotten who you are or what you do for the fleet
310679 its not that at all but you locked me in your quarters understand that is very inappropriate
310680 work is getting done and it makes the people feel more comfortable to know that youre healing the breach between yourself and commander adama
310681 i think that youre spending more time than you used to there
310682 and i think youre enjoying yourself i hear youre sleeping
310683 no dont tell me i dont want to know how people know im sleeping on galactica
310684 im your fathers persistent houseguest he cant seem to get rid of me
310685 yeah i noticed youre spending a lot of time with him
310686 tigh told me that youd gotten locked in his quarters the other day even
310687 its hard to find you these days youre never on colonial one anymore and no one ever really sees you on galactica either is it the cancer
310688 ive missed you come back to colonial one with me

310694 and their lives will improve by discovering their mother kills people for a living certainly andrew would be impressed but do you really think that danielle would even believe me
310695 i was already a crack shot i know how to do things right the first time my bosses call me coup de grace i take head shots
310696 and that was a little more graphic than i wanted to get
310697 im telling you things i could die for its impolite not to return the favor

310714 wisteria lane is a great place to live dont get me wrong

310721 aware and pretty sure the wraith would run from my boys
310722 all ive thought about for the last week is what i was going to do to you when they left
310723 and you are bent over the sofa chief tyrol created especially for you and my father for the wedding with your smalls around your ankle
310724 yes i am but that doesnt mean i want it more than you
310725 weve known for a month they were going away i know you youve been thinking about how many ways i can make you scream youve been planning
310726 but youre the one with all the youth and impetuousness you did greet me with your tongue down my throat and your cock hard and ready or did you forget captain apollo
310727 id been thinking about what im going to do to you on the way up the walk
310728 i want to strip you naked and taste every inch of your body
310729 is that all an idle sexual fantasy while walking to the house had you that hard
310730 ive spent every morning in the shower with my eyes closed imagining that my fingers were yours and frakking myself cross eyed youre going to lose this bet captain and spend the rest of the time making it up to me
310731 you need me so badly that you have to give yourself a little relief every morning
310732 i am a genius when it comes to people remember
310733 even if im having an affair with my married stepson who i was too dumb to realize i was in love with until i married his father
310734 lets not leave me out of the blame and the guilt
310735 it would have been better that way not so much hiding
310736 i think i loved you even back then but with everything the way it was
310737 back then i was going to die and we didnt know up from down we had responsibilities to consider
310738 but then you see me and things are convenient and its like the gods want this to happen
310739 but if you dont make love to me right now ill be sad
310740 i think we should consider turning the barn into a small press now that weve sold the cattle to quintus
310741 it would give us both something to occupy ourselves with
310742 we can play doting grandparents and help lee and kara out that is what retirement means bill not working all the time
310743 its got some of our best ceramics in it we could lease it as lab or learning space after lee and i mucked it out
310744 weve been discussing the barn for forty five minutes bill
310745 we just sold the cattle two hours ago the barn can sit idle for a whole twenty four hours before we are officially wasting precious resources
310746 i never want to see a wadded up paper with writing on it in landing
310747 if we forget history weve lost it forever and that is a hurt worse than any we can imagine for our grandchildren
310748 would you ever have thought you would have an argument over the disposal of a spare barn
310749 i dont know why but i never thought i could do everything i wanted in life with a family to take care of and now here we are domestic felicity
310750 you should have had daughters little girls with your smile
310751 i have kara and lara for daughters im content to have our family as it is bill
310752 if i have a fight with kara it doesnt mean its not a good idea
310753 it seems that you have this realization regularly but only when youve fought with your wife
310754 my gods are we really going to do this again you are the center of my life
310755 theres a difference and i am nearly seventy lee running away from your problems to take care of my arthritis is gross stupidity at best
310756 i wish they had been your children i wish you could have been the mother of my children
310757 i dont care what you fought about but dont do that to me to get back at her
310758 we have each other its no use discussing what never could have happened
310759 i think i would like to be alone now lee
310760 either that or lee is feeding him growth hormone when ive got my back turned hell i wouldnt put it past your husband to try to bulk him up at that
310761 im saying hello to your brother right now young lady
310762 nobody is going to listen to you when you talk like that
310763 theyre not are they oh no grandma is not going to listen
310764 someone is always less of a brat when youre around
310765 i swear you should have had a batch of your own mine all like you better than me its probably because im a pilot not a child wrangler
310766 thats the prerogative of grandparents and crazy aunties i think you do just fine as a mother kara
310767 they go further and further every day and if you try to follow them they get craftier
310768 thats not nice im sorry she probably needs a nap
310769 honestly its okay that shes a little girl ill tell you when shes being an unbearable monster
310770 i can watch the brood or make dinner if youd like tonight your choice
310771 and they say mother in laws are supposed to suck
310772 thank you so much for helping out lees been so busy helping president billy with the irrigation crisis in the outlands that hes been useless in the house when hes even home
310773 lara always remember boys cheat when it comes to real work okay
310774 oh so that wasnt you who didnt do the breakfast dishes
310775 do you know how hard it is to unstick oatmeal
310776 im not joking about the oatmeal though it would have been easier to scrub if youd just glued the bowls together
310777 your grandmother is a stern taskmaster she doesnt let you forget anything shell keep you honest
310778 or shell teach you how to look honest while telling tales
310779 theyre making us dinner and watching our pack of wild animals
310780 come prove to your parents that youre capable of being an adult
310781 i love you i love you a thousand times i love you didnt i tell you enough last week i love you i feel a little guilty but you are my captain apollo and i love being loved by you i love that we say it i love you if you were unsure lover to each other i love the way you look at me when were making love i love that i can use the word love and love using it four and five times a sentence and yes i do think you should burn this letter my best loved captain apollo no matter what declaration i made about preserving papers of the settlement i love you but i do not love what it would mean if we were discovered
310782 eighty years old and confessing to lusting in my heart see what you do to me clearly i remain as in love with you as i ever was captain clearly always have always will always did love you so lets not have that argument again married adulterers dont get to have the luxury of jealousy dont tell me how much you dont love your wife and i wont bore you by telling you how much ive come to love my husband because lies do not become liars oh gods that sounded better in my head anyhow your father wants to see you come visit if i cant make love to you old age being what it is i can at least make you those oatmeal cookies you love all right dont be stubborn your laura
310783 why do you always ask me if im happy if i were unhappy do you think that watching you abandoning kara and the children would make me any happier captain do you think that running away our own cabin away from everyone was my favorite fantasy for a decade ill thank you not to remind me would solve any problems we are not good people lee and i love you anyway i love you and i want you terribly your fathers going fishing with tigh on saturday we can be unhappy together
310784 i think its inappropriate its a clever way to play on both of our names but its cruel lee im glad that you have a daughter i think lara is a beautiful baby and i love her and i love kara but its so cruel to all three of us dont you think i wanted to have your children dont you think i wish she was ours what were you thinking
310785 there is no question this was a warrantless entry but thats not the end of the story
310786 how far does the law go to allow re entry
310787 this situation obviously has an emotional ring to it and people think thats cruel but were working with statutory regulations
310788 there is a distinction between negligent conduct and intentional conduct
310789 some peoples idea that you provide every vaccine that comes out
310790 the overwhelming evidence was that most of the horses were in good condition
310791 there is no basis for any claim of lack of nutrition lack of weight or lack of veterinarian care
310792 he does not intend to get out of the horse business
310793 part of our agenda is to get the horses back
310794 letting a young immature woman get into a car by herself with 13 000 to go off and meet two convicted felons that they knew were bringing at least one firearm with them
310795 some significant gaps that cannot be filled in except by speculation
310796 there doesnt seem to be a lot of corroborating information about ms moolics information
310797 she pointed to a puppy mill in somerville she doesnt specifically identify ms clark
310798 that leaves open the question if they were in filthy condition as stated in the affidavit we dont know how long ms moolic had them
310799 they went in my house and they stole my personal phone book and my town license
310800 i havent had a chance to speak for myself they all lied
310801 nothing alleged presents a lack of subsistence or medical care
310802 i did not receive the warrant in my hands when they come to take my dogs
310803 i was not at home i had cleaned all the dogs gave them food and water
310804 they went into my room stole my digital camera took all the phone books and weekly planners and left it a mess
310805 i got dogs i love very much and i hope they dont hurt any one of them
310806 the judge is going to be asked whether there was legal basis to take the animals into custody
310807 im going to fight them every step of the way even if i have to take it to federal court and the supreme court in washington d c
310808 this is a felony case and that is one of the reason we didnt want to rush judgment on the situation
310809 made several attempts to place herself in the way of the humane agents
310810 suddenly jumped from her chair with a cordless phone in her hand and struck agent lorraine nickerson several times in the head and shoulder area
310811 i know we were criticized and unfairly i feel for moving too slowly but by taking our time we did it right
310812 we now have five felony charges and 16 criminal charges
310813 i am not questioning what they wrote in fact we sent a humane agent to investigate
310814 but the problem is the agent found the house was clean and the dogs specifically complained about were under the care of a vet and we have those records
310815 no district attorneys office in this state would ever touch it at that point
310816 i asked if the town clerk just issued the kennel licenses then without a municipal inspection and jesse turner said that was right
310817 fern clark told me the animals were her pets only
310818 the state is fast to charge a lot of people these days and you just wonder what good this does anybody
310819 because of the emotions that people all of us have about animals
310820 many of these animals were older and they probably wouldve died soon anyway
310821 within the best of her means my client was taking care of them
310822 every dog and cat seized had major medical issues that could be traced to failure to provide necessary treatment
310823 the state stepped in to protect the animals following investigations of complaints of a breeding operation in somerville maine and evidence procured during the arrest of a woman in massachusetts
310824 sufficient articulate suspicion to request a search warrant because there was no basis from any source that the animals were in need of necessary medical care
310825 thats what it takes not to be cruel to animals
310826 do we do that well to our people in maine care
310827 if it cost the state 55 000 how do they expect clark to do it
310828 our view is just because youve got cancer would you want to be put out of your misery
310829 take all the animals before a finding of guilt is troubling
310830 as far as i know communism isnt in the country
310831 when animal welfare was up there searching they actually found some photos they suspected was child pornboigraphy so they stopped their search they called me i went up viewed the photographs i did a second search warrant and seized the photographs and some other materials some computers
310832 sunday service is reclaiming that space to put our stamp back on it and say were not gonna be scared here
310833 its ours were gonna have our services as usual and youre not gonna stop us
310834 youre in a worship service youre watching children youre opening yourself up saying this is the most beautiful thing ive ever seen this is most horrible thing ive ever seen and that quick transition is a very powerful and difficult thing to overcome
310835 were doing everything we can because thats one of the issues is to decrease the anxiety enough to have a service without looking over your shoulder
310836 theres so many things on so many levels i think his opening words are about having the gift to not try to say anything at least right now
310837 the power of voice managerial affective states and future firm performance
310838 consider a manager who believes she is competent and in control of the firm information about firm performance would reflect her actions taken while running the firm if the manager has private information that is inconsistent with her beliefs regarding her competence an uncomfortable emotional state will arise
310839 everyday you see these horses theyre almost starving to death you see their rib bones their back bones their tale bones they walk around they look pitiful
310840 the horses are ultimately suffering for it theyre literally dying over there
310841 they dont feed the horses theyve gone all winter long without being fed maybe a couple of bails of hay here and there just neglect real bad neglect
310842 ive seen the sheriff over there two or three times telling them to feed the horses theyll feed them for about a week then thats it its back to the same situation
310843 im not sure if its truly mistreatment or they dont have the means to take care of the animals and if thats the case they at to at least give them to somebody

310847 was there nothing else to be done but suppose that i had put by some money so i could have saved his teachers their trouble and employed my day in myself opening out lands for that little traveller whom i myself have brought into the land suppose that i had looked round the world for people with small boys who think as i do and that we had taken upon us to bring up these young animals so that they kept right of horns and tails and fairy tales
310848 small boys have a bad time of it you know
310849 they had a worse time of it in the old days
310850 being a mother has taught me more about the grace of god and my own shortcomings than any other experience in my life i see gods grace every morning as they wake up healthy and strong as they laugh and giggle as they run and play as their minds develop right before my eyes my biggest lesson learned is to cherish every moment with your children they grow too fast god never gives you more than you can handle and i am going to do all that i can for my little ones especially when they face challenges
310851 true some of the lessons theyve taught me were not very fun as they were happening but the good moments mix up with the not so good moments in a wonderful curriculum ordained for me by god himself
310852 i honestly can say that being a mother is the most powerful and important feeling in the world
310853 god gave me strength when i couldnt go on life when my body was trying to shut down encouragement to my broken heart meals when the refrigerator was empty a place to live when ends did not meet peace in the midst of turmoil and a contentment that went beyond my circumstances sure life gets hard now and then my heart may still become anxious and my mind may begin to assume the worse but today i know that contentment comes from within i have learned to be content regardless of my circumstances because god is faithful to me i am so very blessed
310854 this is the place i come to share my stories thoughts prayers battles struggles and victories as a christian mom
310855 thanks to the help and prayers of everyone inside and outside the hospital and all over the world we once again have triumphed over this trial

310857 i will testify with other details fbi involved currently under investigation and he will be charged with five capital murders
310858 i have been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury in washington d c on august 1 2008
310859 you may know somebody who perhaps was involved with this anthrax investigation were asking you

310861 listen this is my argument against john mccain im not going to
310862 if obama is president will we still call it the white house
310863 well its race people just dont want a black president

310866 i go with the girl who brought me theres money in washington im sending it home
310867 each overnight community designates a severe weather shelter type of place like a school or building and thats all designated ahead of time so they know where that will be and be we know where that will be and it says 24 hour access and if it gets bad enough normally law enforcement is in those communities and does come through and help us with notification and stuff
310868 today were at the scandinavian heritage park in minot one of the most beautiful parks in minot but how do you think they get it to look so nice
310869 let it get down to the bottom then i go like this then i pull back i dont pull i use my body thats the best thing when you get here then youve got to pull but after 100 times it gets tiresome
310870 so thats how you cut the grass on this hill so far so good
310871 yep now you have to pull straight back now youll have to use your arms
310872 its work isnt it thats why i wanted you to do it ok clayton the next thing were going to do is clean the pond the water is 14 inches so were going to give you waiters and if you dont fall youll stay dry the crutch helps
310873 i know it did i think it would have been better if you fell but you might have gotten hurt ok clayton the next job we got for you is to do some weeding in the flower bed here is some knee pads for you to keep your knees from getting sore and wet
310874 theres a lot of equipment that goes with this job

310876 we have gotten more and more participation with 28 sales in town which is over a quarter of the homes in town people need to make a little extra money right now and there will be all kinds of stuff from clothing to antiques to kids stuff all kinds of variety
310877 its a pretty big endeavor when you think about coordinating everything and taking 500 people for seven days across the state and providing every need that they have
310878 its people from out of state that would never have come here otherwise but love to ride bike and they come and they fall in love with the state because of the scenery and also because of the great people theyre just blown away by how friendly theyre treated most of them say we come in these little communities and were treated just like celebrities they just cant believe it
310879 the most important thing is caring for the riders so i think that has gone a long way toward word of mouth you know that we do try our very best to accommodate them in every way that we can and make sure their needs are met make sure theyre safe and taken care of
310880 its hard its mentally hard because a lot of things that you buy you really dont need but you think you need it
310881 it took a long time for me to look at the house and think this is my house
310882 when families have savings and assets it not only prevents them from falling into financial ruin when you own things you are invested in your community in a way you normally would not be
310883 people save given the right incentives and right structure but that they will save even at very low incomes which was stunning
310884 that is certainly not true today if it ever was
310885 you think im working im making good money you never think this might not last you have to have something put away
310886 anyone who goes through an ida program is not going to be pushed into a subprime loan they would be put into a mortgage that is suitable for them and their financial situation
310887 start with a down payment theyve had financial education about homeownership and they have all been guided to high quality mortgage products that they can afford
310888 in order for our city to be able to rebuild our families would need a place to stay they would need somewhere for their children to go when they went to work
310889 right before katrina i was working for a collection agency of course they didnt come back after katrina my husband didnt have a job i didnt have a job and for the longest we were just living off of insurance money
310890 when families invest in a productive asset their children tend to do the same thing
310891 matched savings plans are a great way to think of how to make savings easy and how to encourage it
310892 idas have served an important role in demonstrating that low income households can save
310893 now we need to develop a national inclusive savings policy that can efficiently bring all households into the savings system

310900 jena six i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong that an injustice what had been done when sean bell got shot i put out a statement saying immediately this is a problem

310907 is it valid to go after barack obama on inexperience being a bit glib perhaps even a bit arrogant for doing the european tour absolutely but you just sound dopey when you put paris hilton in an ad
310908 to come up with a more affirmative narrative for his candidacy why is he running what does he stand for before going after barack obama
310909 mccain has lost the free media contest over the past couple of weeks hes desperate to make the news
310910 most voters wont see the parallels between a presidential candidate and two party girls so a legitimate point about inexperience gets lost in the appearance of name calling
310911 t here is nothing i would take off the table
310912 the impact of his love for raymond is not often seen but i believe felt by most residents of raymond even when he knew the end was close he maintained an optimism that i have never seen before or since
310913 he was a man of more vision and progressive thought about community than most of us have in a lifetime
310914 he was a strong supporter of education kids recreation and community
310915 he had a weekend sock drawer with all of his mismatched socks that he used when he wasnt working so he often had on a blue and brown sock
310916 when laying out the location of the middle school soccer field and track which is now named in his memory
310917 he boosted me up a tree and i nailed a board onto where he thought the centerline of the field would be going through the radius of the track
310918 this was hard to imagine at the time as the site was all overgrown and like a jungle when you were at ground level
310919 years later after the field was actually constructed i noticed that the stake we had nailed on the tree and long forgotten during construction ended up being within a foot or two of where the field actually got built

310936 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same us government that you aspire to lead

310991 i think its every girls dream to see how they compare to other women
310992 its great we get a stylist who chooses our dresses a professional hairdresser and a photographer then we get photographed in beautiful locations i really wanted to take part in this
310993 our country is recognized for the beauty of its women
310994 i consider ours one of a very few countries perhaps even the only country where female beauty is in the blood where it is a national resource because of this i feel that beauty contests here are very significant they glorify these national resources
310995 its not that russian women are more beautiful than other women
310996 its just that slavic beauty is a universal kind of beauty

311002 the daily yoga will not only help the girls deal with the stress of the contest
311003 it will also help give the girls the confidence theyll need to talk to the media often a girl can do well in the beauty part of the competition but when it comes to talking to the press or on stage she has trouble expressing her thoughts the yoga helps with that a lot
311004 because of the small number of men in our country there arent a lot of women who have kids and a full family
311005 we feel that a woman who has a child but not a husband is no worse than any other woman
311006 developing family priorities the maternal spirit and female beauty as a national resource
311007 the contest was important not only for providing people with information about hiv but also for helping the women work through some of their own issues

311041 im not sure i understand something there is no paper involved no ink no binding no shipping in addition marketing will be less about store displays and more about internet ads and pop ups that piggyback on similar audiences so this should lower the cost of moving books but theyre paying less money if authors are squeezed by lower margins wont that descrease the number of writers what do you predict will happen higher prices fewer authors greater sales

311045 we make clear that network operators can block any illegal content or applications that are intended to harm the network
311046 the ruling makes clear for instance that providers can block child pornography or pirated video and music indeed blocking illegal content could go a long way to reducing bandwidth congestion
311047 there is no longer any doubt that isps have the right to use network management tools to address unlawful activity including the theft of copyrighted music
311048 the fcc proceeding concluding today has generated a healthy and appropriate debate about how isps should manage their networks we applaud chairman martins clear affirmation that isps may use technology to prevent the theft of copyrighted works
311049 allowing isps to address capacity and piracy abuses is the best way of providing consumers with a dynamic content rich broadband experience
311050 reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services

311075 the tv show was being targeted to kids who werent already going to broadway there was very little overlap in demographics
311076 if you come from a reality setting theres a certain stigma there
311077 but now im looking at the future and broadway was a great move because its so credible

311087 he was trying to apologize so i was walking with him just to be there
311088 i dont anticipate this having any lingering effect on this team
311089 we were talked to and things were squashed thats it thats the way it is it happened there will be no retaliation by anybody on anything when you look at the schedule we dont play the panthers this year so we need to be smart when were out there
311090 when i was 22 i was a different guy so im not trying to spin anything
311091 you spend two hours with somebody and now you know them thats not the case
311092 obviously everybody is going to be waiting to see what the repercussions are from this event
311093 im just praying that we rally together as a team because obviously theres going to be some adversity here the focus is not where it needs to be right now
311094 im hoping we can all come together as a team as a family and are able to put this behind us

311112 the team gave me some runs early and that made things easier
311113 he battled through it hes not going to have every game where hes really dominant as long as he gives us a chance to win in the end thats all that matters
311114 its all speculation until they call you into the office
311115 when you face a pitcher like cook you cant afford to give up many runs and unfortunately we gave up too many
311116 we just let too many guys cross the plate against us
311117 i got into a situation where i needed to execute some big pitches with two outs and two guys on and i just didnt execute
311118 i fell behind atkins and left the ball up and i fell behind iannetta and left the ball up to him thats the difference in the game right there

311136 shes got a constant pa personal assistant by her side a minder plus theres a security guard watching her
311137 ive had soreness back there but this is the first time ive actually had any arm problems
311138 its a good thing that its nothing serious a couple days off and it will be fine
311139 i try to do everything i can to keep my arm in shape and i think ive done a good job
311140 im 27 years old and this is the first time anythings ever crept up and its nothing serious
311141 i just want to help them get to a common goal and thats winning a title the last 35 hours have been a whirlwind for me
311142 just go out there and read the ball off the bat i understand what im supposed to do in center
311143 you think about it but its not like its going to define who i am you think about it every day and now i have the opportunity to achieve that goal
311144 it cant be that much different two guys that care about baseball two guys that care about how people play
311145 obviously hes not going to be the same junior he was in the 90s
311146 but i dont think hes going to have any problems playing out there in center field
311147 hes a different guy but hes definitely not a bad guy i think there was definitely a different sense that was going on in the clubhouse over the last week i think it was kind of uncomfortable not so much for the players because were kind of used to things going on i think the relationship with maybe upper management and what direction things were going he can be a huge part of your offense and all that and when things dont seem like theyre going all in the same direction it was just different it was kind of a weird feeling in here
311148 i think that its good for this team this organization right now that we can go on with direction with this team right now i think things escalated to degrees to where something had to be done either way we lose a hall of famer we lose the best right handed hitter ive ever played with we gain a very good outfielder and a very good hitter its time that this team starts playing better
311149 i think we should celebrate the fact that he was such a great player for us
311150 but i think people tend to blame or might want to blame him for everything thats gone wrong on this team so far this year i dont think thats right either we still have a lot of games left we have a very good player in jason bay
311151 aint no cleanup hitter like that you know what im saying good player did what he was supposed to do while he was here thats about it
311152 to me hes the greatest hitter ive ever seen being able to play with him
311153 i know theres other great hitters in the league i just havent been able to be their teammates his swing is unbelievable he really worked hard at trying to perfect it which seems almost ridiculous when you have such a perfect swing and youre trying to make it better but i think thats why his numbers are what they are for me a sure fire first ballot hall of famer and when he gives his speech hell probably give it via satellite because hes in brazil that will be perfect hell be wearing a brazilian national team hat when he does it and watching a soccer game
311154 i think we needed to do something to make our ballclub better
311155 if this was the general managers way of doing it and our front office guys way of doing it and making our ballclub better than so be it well find out if it makes our ballclub better in the next two months
311156 i really didnt think anything was going to happen so i took a nap
311157 and at 5 oclock i wake up and my phone has 87 000 messages that manny got traded so i had to get online and check
311158 its just one of those things where now you know what the future is
311159 before you didnt know what it was going to hold now we know what our team looks like from this day forward were happy that jason bay is here because hes a great guy ive talked to a couple of teammates in pittsburgh and they say hes a really good teammate and a really good guy if youre going to replace manny ramirez youre not going to replace his stats if youre going to replace him youre hoping to get a good teammate and thats what we got
311160 his whole career has been remarkable hes one of the best right handed hitters in history and his numbers speak for themselves he was a key part of two world series teams no one can ever take that away from him were not going to we dont want to we wish him well going forward and realize as we sit here today on aug 1 thats now in our past and were moving forward as a team
311161 i think that now its a new era with griff gone he was the franchise since 2000 now hes gone it kind of starts a new time with the reds im ready for that we have a great nucleus here no matter what the record says we have a good team im just excited to be a piece of it
311162 i talked to him about what i require a third hitter to do
311163 without taking away his aggressiveness hell need to be a little more selective at the plate take your pitch he batted third most of his life in the minor leagues well see
311164 i think ive hit third in two games in the big leagues
311165 no matter what its where im used to hitting obviously with ken being here there was no question over who was batting third
311166 this is the biggest trade ive ever been a part of in the middle of the season and probably the last major major trade like this was hank aaron from the braves to the brewers
311167 it was the best thing he was the best player on this team and was here for so long were going to miss his face were going to miss his name
311168 its not about what i want its about what the reds want
311169 plus it starts with you guys in the media people read what you say if you say bruce almighty theyll say we want to see bruce its the truth when people see griffey its the kid and its catchy griffey is the man he still is the man
311170 i talked to him and he told me to be myself and people will like me for who i am i took that to heart i want to be like barry larkin thats my idol itd be nice to have a c on my chest like larkin but i dont think theyre doing cs anymore itd be nice to be a captain a guy like griffey his shoes are hard to fill ill make sure to step my game up even higher than what im doing right now i think its about that time
311171 whenever something like that happens everything including baseball just pales in comparison your immediate thoughts go to the families the mothers the fathers and the children
311172 it was definitely an eerie feeling knowing that it just happened
311173 im sure it was much tougher for the guys here thinking about their families that could have been traveling that road or they live off that road
311174 because its so close if we had been in practice at the time we probably would have heard the noise
311175 it was bad thing we were following everything on tv in the clubhouse we were very sad about what happened it wasnt easy to concentrate on baseball
311176 we knew there were more important things going on but we were honored to play in that game i know there was a lot of fundraising going on
311177 i wanted to be here quickly but i didnt know when they were going to call me up
311178 im going to be ready im going to try to help the team play hard
311179 whenever they make a move there is so much that goes into it as a player i try to keep away from all that stuff
311180 a basket dinner was served under a tent on the lawn
311181 dinner was served on tables under the trees near the river
311182 its nice to have him back in the lineup hes excited and were happy to have him
311183 hes not 100 percent his legs going to take a long time to heal but he feels its close enough to 100 percent to play
311184 its been a long time coming into a season you never expect injuries but they do happen ive been around a long time and sometimes you just got to understand its not meant to be but ive worked hard to get back
311185 weve been struggling offensively since the all star break its a perfect time to get a guy back like that hell probably get some other guys some better pitches
311186 just to have his presence in the lineup just to have a home run threat in the middle of our lineup is huge
311187 hell be a huge impact hes going to make everybody around him better the guys in the top of the order theyll get on base and hopefully hell drive them in and if they pitch around him the guys behind him will be able to drive them in hes a big threat in the lineup obviously he has a hall of fame career and its huge to have him back in our lineup we missed him big time
311188 its going to be tough the first few games but ill be fine ive always adjusted
311189 in a world with ever increasing demands on resources and with new and ongoing humanitarian crises and development needs it is vital that usaid reach out to and work with the nongovernmental sector in order to advance change
311190 we need to take calcium and vitamin d in childrens diets very seriously otherwise were looking at a weak generation of kids and this shouldnt be happening in america

311198 in search of winning a world series title that was important my kids are getting older and it wasnt the situation in seattle where i wanted to get closer to home it was a chance for me winning a title i think that was the biggest draw
311199 theres things that i can do to help this ballclub
311200 having a manager ozzie guillen who didnt very many home runs hes very keen on making sure you get the runner over and knock him in and thats the key to winning ball games ive been around for a little while so i understand the game
311201 i dont worry about him playing center field thats like riding a bike
311202 you know if this guy was out of baseball thats a bit different he was in the outfield for a long time hes obviously not going to be the same junior he was in the 90s but i dont think he should have any problems
311203 these guys have done a great job and i just want to help them get to a common goal and thats winning a title
311204 it doesnt really weigh on me you think about it but it doesnt really define who i am
311205 i respect the game of baseball i enjoyed my time as a player and i will continue to enjoy it the only i really know how to do is play baseball i dont have fortune 500 businesses and stuff like that you think about it every day and now i have an opportunity to reach that goal
311206 i didnt really agree with it i feel like hes given a lot i feel like hes one of the greatest hitters in the mlb
311207 to give him up in a pennant race is tough i dont know what happened behind the scenes but its tough i thought he brought a lot to red sox nation
311208 its a shame that you always give someone up in the year of free agency they should have held onto him until the end of the year wow eight years
311209 we miss manny we liked manny best pure hitter in the major leagues
311210 i dont think they should have traded him but it happens

311240 in one aspect this the coaches hall of fame is the same as the other two its a great honor and another accolade you receive i guess its kind of different in the fact that kutztown was my college and exeter was my high school and thats voted on by the different school authorities
311241 however the coaches hall of fame is every player or coach thats walked on a field in berks county its a great honor and im really not that good with awards because to me im still involved in a game that ive been playing since i was a kid in my backyard
311242 for someone to hand me an award for it is very gratifying and im very thankful for it
311243 i used to take my younger sister and stand her out in the yard with a football in her hands
311244 and just tackle her until she or both of us got tired
311245 in high school the sports transitioned right into one another and it was pretty easy for me to do
311246 i certainly enjoyed basketball and there were things about being on the track team that i liked i loved the competition of both those sports but my heart has always been with football
311247 the day of the draft i was at the pennsylvania state track meet
311248 and i actually had a scout from the dallas cowboys drive me home to see what the results of the draft was going to be
311249 we were able to work out a deal and go to seattle
311250 i was from a small school and nobody gave me much of a chance i think but it didnt take me long to show i could play ultimately with both of the teams i had tryouts with it was exciting especially to come out of a tunnel and having 70 000 fans screaming for you
311251 at kutztown we were lucky if we had 5 000 people at a game so i was certainly proud of it and i would not trade it in for anything else that ive done
311252 i saw an article in the reading paper that there was going to be an arena football team coming to reading in the upcoming year and i wrote an email to their web site
311253 we shook hands and i was asked to come and meet him i came in to meet him later on that week and at the end of the day i was the first employee of the reading express
311254 i know the highs and lows that they go through on a weekly and even daily basis i think coming to this team for me was a perfect fit
311255 there is a lot to think of and a lot to keep track of but im absolutely doing what i love
311256 im involved with football every day and i get to have my kids and family involved to me its like being tiger woods every day and being able to golf except i do something with football every day

311277 many of you will be first time parent participants in this areas various summer youth league competitions your appearance here demonstrates how as concerned parents you have realized the importance of displaying appropriate conduct while your child is participating as an athlete
311278 to start todays session well have an overview of the entire training program our first block of instruction will involve the basics of yelling at the umpire next will come a quick look at the principle tactics involved in baiting managers the final segment is devoted to disorderly conduct with both other parents and officials during games
311279 i know thats a lot to cover but this is a very important subject and if you pay attention we just might have a surprise lecturer come by before the evening is over
311280 now when first beginning to yell at umpires its best to limit your attacks we prefer to call them interactions to total strangers however as your expertise grows youll discover being rude and abusive becoming easier and easier even when the ump happens to be some life long acquaintances
311281 remember its your duty as parents to serve as role models for your children you must show them the importance of authority and how to give it proper respect if you must question a friends honesty or intelligence to accomplish this goal well thats just the breaks
311282 lets move on to the subject of manager harassment of course anyone can verbally degrade and vilify the opposing teams manager what takes special talent is intimidating your childs manager
311283 if this were a perfect world perhaps there would be no need to straighten out managers but sad to say we do not live in a perfect world almost inevitably your childs manager will either fail to give your young star enough playing time or else play him in the wrong position
311284 now i know what youre thinking what if my childs the teams pitcher
311285 it is not impossible for a manager to recognize your childs greatness and play him in the proper position and for an appropriate amount of time like every minute of the game however even these managers are prone to call for the wrong pitch or signal some totally inane play in that case it becomes your job as responsible parents to loudly remind the manager of his shortcomings as with the abuse of umpires this public humiliation of managers will demonstrate to your child the importance of authority and the proper respect it should be shown
311286 this object is one of the primary working tools of the disorderly parent and as we all know being an effective disorderly parent is often an essential element in your young players chances for victory
311287 it will be up to you to see that your childs team and its followers presents a truly hostile and aggressive demeanor if the other team ever seems to be gaining the upper hand it will become your duty to negate if not terminate the effectiveness of their parents several tactics can be used to accomplish this objective one is physical threats and intimidation by the way this is most effective at your home field
311288 ladies and gentleman this is the special surprise i mentioned earlier the right rev doctor dorite from mighty big church has stopped by to make a few choice remarks
311289 and youre a fine group i just know youll make excellent parent participants
311290 id like to say a few words to those of you with children playing in church leagues dont think for a second that eddies advice doesnt apply to church league play like many other churches we at mighty big church see it as part of our mission to field winning teams
311291 to accomplish this goal we can always use the help of you parents that doesnt mean were not doing everything possible to win for instance like other churches we occasionally recruit ringers who have seldom if ever attended worship services in our tabernacle
311292 weve even formed our own league the behemoth churches alliance designed to exclude those little churches which might happen to have winning teams
311293 all this is dedicated to one objective beating the stuffing out of those lost souls at all the lesser houses of worship thereby demonstrating our physical and spiritual superiority

311372 we need to protect consumers access said fcc chairman kevin martin a republican
311373 while comcast has said it would stop the arbitrary blocking consumers deserve to know that the commitment is backed up by legal enforcement
311374 congress has intentionally refrained from imposing the heavy hand of government which is precisely why we have seen such rapid growth in the internet
311375 the fccs bipartisan decision to punish comcast is a major victory defying every ounce of conventional wisdom in washington everyday people have taken on a major corporation and won an historic precedent for an open internet
311376 comcasts history of deception and continued blocking show contempt for the online consumer protections established by the fcc
311377 todays order makes it clear that there is nothing reasonable about restricting access to online content or technologies moving forward this bellwether case will send a strong signal to cable and phone companies that such violations will not be tolerated
311378 but the fight is far from over a duopoly market where phone and cable companies control nearly 99 percent of high speed connections will not discipline itself we look forward to working with the fcc and congress to ensure proactive measures keep the internet open and free of discrimination and accessible to all americans

311391 for me to be able to handle my 50 year old wife sleeping in a bed with a 19 year old boyfriend and using my gym and driving my cars and living in my house i guess weve got a pretty good act going on cause thats a lot to take on
311392 it wasnt an argument it was hey i dont love you i dont want to be with you i dont want to see you anymore it was the real deal
311393 yeah well you know wed had problems over the last 10 years but you know i thought that when you put your hand on the bible you know until death do us part and for better or worse i thought people really meant that when they said it
311394 this is a simple divorce theres no custody theres just a big pile of junk that weve accumulated we should split it however the judge wants it and walk away but you know my wifes lawyer has told different magazines theres gonna be a war
311395 this is the money that i saved for my family and money that linda could walk away with money that i saved for my children that theyre just theyre just wasting it and burning it up
311396 i am pleased to have this impressive group of campaign professionals as part of my run for lieutenant governor of virginia
311397 with their help i look forward to a rewarding and successful campaign

311403 w ith iran the u s government will again need to keep an eye on the long term communicating with the current government but also encouraging more discussion among iranians and more contacts and interactions between iranians and americans
311404 societies and governments change the u s government has some ability to foster favourable trends in iran but these policies will take time to come to fruition
311405 appears to be on its way to becoming a nuclear power
311406 a large majority of iranians strongly believe that iran has the same right as other nations to develop nuclear energy including the construction and operation of nuclear enrichment facilities
311407 if irans facilities were to be bombed public support for any retaliation its government took would likely be widespread
311408 strong push to retaliate as c ritics of such a policy would likely choose to keep silent
311409 to finance the reconstruction of the facility and continue the current programme without major budgetary consequences
311410 probably do more to solidify public support for the regime than weaken it
311411 iranian security forces have convincingly shown that they can handle restive ethnic groups and violent opposition to iranian rule is more likely to entrench the current security and political forces than to elicit a positive change in regime policies

311420 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
311421 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
311422 is a violation of u k law as well as of the bilateral agreement governing the island
311423 our intelligence and counterterrorism relationship with the u s is vital to the national security of the united kingdom we accept u s assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the u k or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the u s authorities
311424 neither of those individuals was ever part of cias high value terrorist interrogation program
311425 i think its important the british government makes plain its deep concern that its not being told the truth and that our territories are being used for these purposes

311435 i ran some of the biggest nightclubs in boston for five years until the industry changed
311436 then i fell into dancing just to try it and fell in love with it that is where i gained my confidence in my sexuality and my body i was really quite shy about it before then my mother always taught me brains before beauty
311437 part of my fascination was due to the fact that i had relatively zero knowledge about the adult film industry
311438 prior to watching the movie and like many other mainstream people i had preconceived notions about the industry and the people in it
311439 according to our research and the people weve spoken with john holmes was a chameleon he had the ability to be whatever people wanted him to be at any given time
311440 he could be very crafty and he was street smart but he was also bright funny and as most people know he had the ability to fabricate and tell entertaining stories that would go beyond the realm of believability
311441 he enjoyed seeing how far he could push the boundaries which is probably one of the reasons he told outlandish tales
311442 more importantly he was smart in the sense that he knew how to sell his product and the lies he told were actually a great marketing tool as they served to perpetuate his legend

311448 i know there are many in our community so desperate for peace that they want us to sweep under the rug the pro terrorism positions of some groups there are groups in the islamic world truly dedicated to peace but we should not blind ourselves to the fact that some are not

311468 were gearing up for the biggest struggle our party has faced
311469 im talking about the battle of kyoto our campaign to stop the job killing economy destroying kyoto accord
311470 h ere are a few facts about this so called accord
311471 its based on tentative and contradictory scientific evidence about climate trends
311472 it focuses on carbon dioxide which is essential to life rather than upon pollutants
311473 canada is the only country in the world required to make significant cuts in emissions third world countries are exempt the europeans get credit for shutting down inefficient soviet era industries
311474 implementing kyoto will cripple the oil and gas industry which is essential to the economies of newfoundland nova scotia saskatchewan alberta and british columbia
311475 as the effects trickle through other industries workers and consumers everywhere in canada will lose there are no canadian winners under the kyoto accord
311476 the only winners will be countries such as russia india and china from which canadians will have to buy emission credits kyoto is essentially a socialist scheme to suck money out of wealth producing nations
311477 kyoto will not even reduce greenhouse gases by encouraging transfer of industrial production to third world countries where emission standards are more relaxed it will almost certainly increase emissions on a global scale

311498 there is no doubt that false and damaging rumours were circulating about hbos on 19 march 2008 and these would have had some impact on hboss share price it is difficult however to say how much impact

311500 we have once again delivered a robust performance across our operations
311501 prioritising the provision of equipment and capability to their armed forces engaged in overseas operations
311502 to benefit further from the current high demand for armoured wheeled vehicles to meet operational requirements
311503 credit is an important part of everyday life so it is vitally important that consumers are safeguarded from irresponsible lending and that businesses have clarity about what this constitutes
311504 debt management schemes do not effectively deal with personal insolvency problems and the process can prolong the issue with individuals still forced into bankruptcy at a later date
311505 we expect to see fewer individuals volunteering for insolvency and more being forced into it as the soaring energy prices increased food bills and higher mortgage costs impact
311506 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
311507 this is the toughest trading we have ever seen worse than 9 11
311508 that was a severe hit but the recovery was relatively quick this time it is different
311509 we are likely to begin to see the full effect of the situation after the summer when airlines can see the shortfall in bookings many will find that they are in a very hard position

311511 orange was the attraction where most companies wouldnt have been because it is such an iconic brand
311512 if it was just about running the business i wouldnt have been interested but france telecom which owns orange were looking for a major transformation and to take on a brand with so much potential and re energise it is fantastic
311513 i have a pack of stuff from my pa for the train
311514 on the train first thing in the morning still waking up is a great time for reading and catching up on whats happening
311515 my days are very varied from one hour to the next
311516 one minute i am working on the new brand and tv campaign the next minute i am sitting down with the chief technology officer looking at major plans for the roll out of a high speed data network
311517 we want a whole new style of orange and we want to stand out from the crowd
311518 people want something different from orange and we have to keep it fresh and make people think
311519 i walk into our shops and buy a phone in order to get the whole customer experience
311520 my wife thinks im crazy because i quite often do it at the weekend but it is the only way you can really see what the customer goes through
311521 im on the phone texting and using email all the time
311522 i couldnt live without texting not just because im the chief executive of orange but because it is so embedded in my life
311523 without the coffee im terrible but so long as i have it im fine
311524 i have lots of contact with our head of networks and it around both the new investment and how we can build on our existing network to differentiate us from the competition
311525 orange is a complex and sophisticated business which produces a huge amount of management information so we do a lot of analysis of data from across the company in order to optimise performance
311526 we have got to be mindful that the credit crunch is going on but it is a fantastic time for us to expand
311527 we are going out and opening new stores when everyone else is looking at closing them which is great
311528 weve been making major changes and i want to get everyone across the business working behind it so i am talking to as many people as possible as informally as possible
311529 the most important people in the business are the ones talking to our customers and i can learn so much from talking to them
311530 im getting a bit long in the tooth for it now but its good fun and i have a little bit of a thirst for speed
311531 i am disappointed that talks between british energy and edf have not yet been successful
311532 but our commitment to nuclear power is clear and nuclear new build does not depend on one single deal
311533 edf was the governments get out of jail free card which hasnt materialised there are tough decisions to be made as the reality is britain will run short of power
311534 conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date
311535 uk manufacturers faced a dangerous combination of deteriorating market conditions and record cost inflation in july the latest data point to a further marked reduction in uk manufacturing output
311536 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
311537 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight i think it would have been a good fit
311538 edf are as people know the worlds largest nuclear operator i think it would have been a very sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk
311539 but the future of new nuclear in the uk doesnt depend on this particular deal
311540 its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged but i think we are absolutely committed to new nuclear power and if this deal is not able to go through for whatever reason we will be looking at plans to make sure we can continue with our foot on the floor because britain needs these new nuclear power stations
311541 it is time to bring this farcical british energy sales process to an end
311542 the employees at british energy are the best in the world and are more than capable of running the next generation of nuclear energy supply if given the opportunity
311543 the government must act in the interests of the employees and the entire nation it is vital we get the new nuclear power station build programme under way in order to reduce our dependency on expensive gas and oil
311544 if we do not act now this dependency will cripple the economy
311545 the government must force british energy to make available their sites in order that international consortiums can build the next generation of power stations
311546 uk manufacturing can develop and become a global supply chain player for nuclear and clean coal power station new build
311547 that wasnt the view of all of the shareholders and of course the government is only a minority shareholder in this publicly listed company so the board has quite rightly overall responsibility to all of the shareholders to try to find the right way forward
311548 i hope that they can i do remain convinced this is the right deal but its got to be acceptable to the shareholders and those are the discussions that are going on today

311556 i dont worry about him playing center field thats like riding a bike
311557 you know if this guy was out of baseball thats a bit different he was in the outfield for a long time hes obviously not going to be the same junior he was in the 90s but i dont think he should have any problems

311651 the statement they made before i got onstage at glastonbury was come out and if youre brilliant youre brilliant and if youre crap youre crap and i came up and i delivered on it and as far as the rest of europe im being very honest i really had the best run i ever had in my life
311652 i categorically and vehemently deny the allegations of justice jose sabio mind you i do not have the habit of waiting in the car for anybody except my wife the allegations are malicious and pure fabrication i am a resident of rockwell
311653 i know francis but i have not authorized him or anybody to make representations for me on any matter that involves cases of meralco and the lopez family we have retainers and lawyers to handle legal matters
311654 i expect matters to get worse because i am up against the billions of the lopezes
311655 at the onset i must state that i cannot even begin to express my anger outrage disgust that a person whom i treated with civil respect and kindness and whom i thought i respected would impute such filthy lies on me but that mr de borja would have the nerve to make these lies under oath is utterly disgusting when it was he who came to me with the offer of the bribe
311656 it was he de borja who would call either me or our mutual friend mrs evelyn clavano to meet up
311657 francis de borja requested me if i have the cell phone number of justice jose sabio jr he de borja related that because he is very close to the lopezes of meralco he wanted to call him sabio regarding his possible inhibition in a certain meralco case wherein he was designated as a substitute member of the division vice a justice who was temporarily on leave by reason of sickness he de borja further said that the lopezes desire that the same justice with whom the lopezes are more comfortable sit in the division
311658 mr de borja called me so suddenly and after having had no contact with him for almost a year
311659 at that point he de borja mentioned the impasse between justice bienvenido reyes and myself
311660 then he de borja explained that he was there to offer me a win win situation
311661 at that point i was shocked that he had a very low regard for me he was treating me like there was a price on my person i could not describe my feelings i was stunned
311662 i cannot in conscience agree to that offer to bribe me
311663 sayang kung hindi ito tatanggapin sayang ang p10 million what a waste if you will not accept the p10 million
311664 i could not believe he would repeat an offer i repeated my no he could not understand
311665 if i accept that offer my conscience will bother me forever
311666 the lopezes will do everything possible using their money and power to discredit me this is just the beginning i know that they will not stop at doing everything to discredit my integrity
311667 i hope jamby was not shooting her mouth off just to get public attention
311668 she has no talent im sure paris would tell you that herself shes got a look that a lot of younger girls liked and copied
311669 the timing was right for her a lot of younger women looked up to her shes very sweet nice girl but thats it then you put a full stop its over so id say paris is infamous

311696 we are continuing our double approach of dialogue and pressure if dialogue does not work we could continue with additional pressure at the u n or eu level
311697 when something like that happens a tragedy you do take a closer look to see what else you can do even better

311703 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
311704 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
311705 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step

311714 i think you have overpaid in terms of executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome on the board
311715 its been about 26 hours in the course of a 24 hour day
311716 my support and my wifes support is with this board and this management team
311717 it seemed like they were more interested in going to lunch than hearing from shareholders
311718 at no point did this board or management in any way ever resist microsofts proposal
311719 we proactively engaged with them and tried to reach a positive conclusion for shareholders

311756 i remember you used to ask me if you got old and dementia if i would visit you in the hospital and i jokingly told you it wouldnt matter because you wouldnt know who i was or remember anyway well i want to tell you i would visit you every single day i would hold your hand and answer the same questions a million times just to be there with you i love you

311761 if the day does not require an ak it is a good day
311762 i feel my game is a lot better obviously the score doesnt show it but i know what i need to work on
311763 i gave it my best today and i felt like i did a lot of good things and hopefully that outshines the ones i made mistakes on
311764 i think if i played a couple pga events in a row it would be a different story its just hard to play one and then one maybe a year later
311765 i think if i played eight in a row and i missed all eight that would be a different story
311766 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
311767 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
311768 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
311769 weve seen these types of worms before typically around myspace
311770 people are more trusting of things they receive from a friend
311771 it never works in the present but it will work in some far off mythical moment that never comes
311772 if they dont patch this in a reasonable time theyre putting their customers at risk
311773 in the spring it was all about vendors who write dns code at its core it was about people who write name servers
311774 not that many people are running bind on os x server and those that do dont need apple to hold their hand about patching
311775 if there was a huge population of people behind dns servers running os x id be more worried thats not a dig against apple its just a statement
311776 it may be a low priority in the scheme of the dns vulnerability but if all my servers are os x it matters
311777 it is valid to say that the target market for the dns exploit doesnt really affect them if only because mac os x is primarily a client side operating system
311778 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does
311779 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day
311780 to me him not being here is the difference between 39th and 38th
311781 im not a great putter but im not a bad putter
311782 the british open was the turning point where i played really well and putted really badly and decided thats it im not a good putter with a short putter ive decided that im going to putt with the belly if you see me with a short one that means that something is wrong with me
311783 when i hit the ball it just didnt go straight today
311784 and i also had been hitting a lot of good putts and i made a bunch today i made some good ones to see balls rolling in now im starting to gain a little bit more confidence a little bit more momentum
311785 i remember when i won the masters in 06 i had a great week the week before
311786 pero si lo hago primero pensar a en mi equipo que es el atlas antes que en el rival
311787 mi idea es seguir apoyando a la selecci n al entrenador y hacer todo lo posible para que el equipo se una
311788 lo que s es que no tenemos tiempo para trabajar ser nuestro primer duelo con l y trataremos de asimilar lo m s r pido posible lo que l quiera
311789 apelamos a formar parte del fondo estrat gico que tiene la organizaci n panamericana de la salud ops para adquirir medicamentos m s baratos pero los laboratorios se negaron a venderlos al pa s bajo ese esquema
311790 as a professional athlete its all about balance and organizing to fit everything in eating right stretching gym time on the courts i am doing the same things as a mom constantly adjusting to the kids schedules meeting their needs day to day i adjust on the fly its about being disciplined but flexible
311791 based on the survey results i see little change going forward for the region with excessive inflationary pressures and slight job losses and an economy that continues to grow at an anemic pace
311792 without strong farm income and healthy exports the regional economy would already be dipping into recessionary territory
311793 even as the states economy expands it continues to lose jobs albeit at a slow pace as in other states minnesota firms are growing output with fewer workers
311794 rising commodity prices have negatively affected food processors in the state
311795 there was never a compelling offer put on the table
311796 la mejor opci n es el tratamiento definitivo operaci n para que pueda estar sin dolor y que pueda llegar a la liguilla y el mundial de clubes al cien por ciento

311798 fiquei muito feliz com a receptividade que tive aqui e espero retribuir a confian a que depositaram em mim jogar na europa o sonho de todo jogador e n o esperava ter essa oportunidade t o cedo mas ser uma experi ncia importante na carreira e uma chance de proporcionar uma vida mais confort vel minha fam lia vou torcer pelo vasco dist ncia e lembrarei eternamente dos bons momentos que passei no clube
311799 dif cil falar ele um bom atacante mas j n o aquele edmundo de antes da poca do palmeiras acho que j n o causa tanto medo para a gente
311800 ele um grande jogador e acho que faz falta para o vasco n o posso dizer que vai facilitar nosso trabalho porque vai ter um outro profissional l que pelo menos faz uma correria o edmundo um jogador experiente e vai fazer falta
311801 seria muito assustador se o urso entrasse em p nico e algum golfista ou torcedor chegasse muito perto

311803 n o tem nada n o tenho conhecimento sobre isso ent o n o tenho o que opinar meu nome est l mas outro f bio gomes da silva
311804 o morais um jogador que patrim nio do clube o que n s conversamos a melhor maneira de encarar uma atitude que n o foi acertada foi uma atitude muito emocional atingido pelas ofensas e pelas amea as ele tomou uma atitude que ao inv s de melhorar a situa o tenderia a pior la
311805 o clube se interessa pelo morais como sempre se interessou ele tem sua vida ligada ao vasco e o que fizemos foi conversarmos um pouco ele mesmo est convencido de que n o foi a atitude mais sensata s trouxe preju zos para ele e para o vasco estamos em um momento em que precisamos de uni o para fazer um vasco mais forte
311806 quanto seguran a o que aconteceu foi um fato isolado mas j tomamos medidas para evitar que a rea de circula o dos jogadores seja melhor cuidada pela seguran a o morais poder ficar totalmente tranquilo quanto a isso
311807 o morais valorizado por n s mas se tiver oferta vamos considerar em termos do que o vasco necessita para recompor financeiro e tamb m do jogador depender do tipo de proposta e da posi o de parte a parte
311808 fico feliz pelo gustavo quem ganha com a volta dele o palmeiras e quem for ajudar sempre bem vindo estou sempre preparado para entrar ou sair do time mas posso dizer que eu e o gladstone estamos em uma crescente muito boa
311809 n o sei se o muricy vai optar por mim se vai jogar com dois ou tr s zagueiros mas com tr s zagueiros d pra folgar na sobra e contar com o companheiro no combate
311810 me sinto muito bem n o tenho mais esse receio de dar trombada trombei com o andr lima hoje em treino e quem caiu foi ele
311811 n o consegui conquistar nenhum t tulo no s o paulo e volto com este objetivo
311812 n o me arrepende de ter sa do na poca foi bom pra mim e para o s o paulo n o tem motivo para lamentar lamento apenas porque se eu soubesse que ia ser campe o de tudo como o s o paulo foi n o teria sa do mas isso a n o d para prever
311813 estou no s o paulo tenho seis meses de contrato assinado com o objetivo de todo jogador que chega aqui que disputar t tulos o s o paulo pensa nisso em toda competi o que entra tem que pensar sempre assim sempre como time grande
311814 it makes them one of our top five sponsors for the week
311815 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
311816 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
311817 is responding well to treatment and will be released soon
311818 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
311819 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
311820 we are in a period that feels a lot like 1991 and 1992 and we had similar issues with a recession at that point in time high oil prices and fear of oil supply shortages
311821 for the next several months and i would say for the next year the credit situation that customers are facing in dealerships will take centre stage
311822 the marketplace is changing rapidly and automakers that are more flexible in their production will fare better
311823 i will work from the assumption that there might be a retrial and i will assume that it is likely to be in the new year
311824 sweetheart not long to go now and im going to really really miss you a lot

311828 i hate you dont leave me understanding the borderline personality
311829 im sorry you feel that way or im happy you feel this way etc
311830 yes i feel how embarrassing that would be for you
311831 yes i see how embarrassing that would be to you
311832 yes i hear you in regards to how embarrassing that you would be for you
311833 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
311834 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
311835 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
311836 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
311837 that was a 1 2 tandem that was one of the best in the game
311838 its a good deal for pittsburgh they got four good players
311839 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
311840 that is a factor and will always be a factor for me
311841 he said well ive got to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
311842 we let it be known with the dodgers that was the one ballclub he had interest in going to that any deal we were going to do was going to be the best baseball deal we could do and it wasnt going to be a financial deal to try to move dollars we just werent happy with the prospect we would be getting back and we chose to hold onto him
311843 it seemed like they were more interested in going to lunch than hearing from shareholders

311846 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
311847 a year from now we may all be saying how on earth could they have given up on manny and a good player like moss and a good young reliever like hansen for jason bay but that just goes to show you how dire the situation with ramirez had become before the sox shipped him to the dodgers at the trade deadline today
311848 as much as ramirez was a pain in the pillows as much as he caused angst and disgust you cant help but get the feeling that the red sox ultimately caved in here ramirez got what he wanted
311849 a guy who occasionally swings like babe ruth and is consistently as nutty as a baby ruth
311850 indeed other than the red soxs terry francona probably the only other current major league manager who can handle ramirez is torre who constantly dealt with wacky late season acquisitions with the new york yankees
311851 colletti pulled this off without giving up on any of the dodgers major prospects and did we mention the red sox are paying ramirez his remaining 7 million
311852 its like colletti announcing hes going to produce a movie and will smith calling to say he wants to be in it for free
311853 the way i see it losing a lot the rest of this season and all of next would be a blessing in the form of higher first round picks and if fewer people come to the ballpark how exactly would you be able to tell
311854 nothing is guaranteed of course huntington might prove every bit as unskilled as his predecessors owner bob nutting might never spend enough money to field a legitimate contender but im willing to give this thing a chance at least theres a plan
311855 pirates management in its various incarnations has been writing this script for 16 years an evident narrative arc to nowhere
311856 characters come and go none fully developed and they are replaced by others far less developed and if you were chilled by chapter 2008 wait until you see chapter 2009
311857 judge it by dollars or by sense this trade had no major obstacles except that the marlins werent committed to making it happen
311858 cant see why not especially with the marlins trying to crush a stadium stopping lawsuit with proof of south floridas need for them if the whole affair was a pr stunt meant to give the appearance of a franchise willing to do anything to reach the world series again it clearly backfired florida fans are tired of being teased
311859 i give the marlins credit for what apparently was a very serious effort to make a very significant deal aimed solely at this pennant race and the 2008 postseason
311860 this isnt your normal collection of ballplayers wearing the black and white
311861 they are not in other words going to win another world series this year
311862 the sox remain a big plodding muscular team that hits for power joe crede when he returns but has trouble manufacturing runs any other way theyd be great in home run derby a recipe for glory it is not
311863 ken griffey jr in center field at the cell a cause to rejoice set off the fireworks
311864 if you can get a guy who has more home runs than frank robinson mark mcgwire harmon killebrew reggie jackson mike schmidt mickey mantle ernie banks and lou gehrig hallelujah and amen
311865 in hindsight he never fit griffey never embraced cincinnati cincinnati didnt give him much of a chance
311866 this isnt a great town for superstars we dont cater well in that respect griffey was always too big a presence he wanted room service we pointed to the drive through
311867 it is a sad time in cincinnati but perhaps it is the dawn of the gm walt jocketty era he was brought in as general manager to turn around seven straight years of losing
311868 trading griffey to the chicago white sox is the beginning younger players are the future not a 38 year old outfielder whose skills are eroding fast due to age and enough injuries to use as a living model for a medical school
311869 he can retire with a great deal of pride because he had an immense career it has been a pleasure to play at his side
311870 on a human level he is also an extraordinary guy and on the pitch he was a warrior who never gave up
311871 i have a lot of memories of him but i think there comes a point when it is time to retire
311872 he extended his sell by date for as long as possible and he needed to retire what he has done has been exceptional
311873 lilian has had a great career i looked at the number of appearances he made and they just went on and on
311874 i spoke to him about two or three months ago and asked him what he had planned the career he had was always at the highest level and when there is a health risk it is better that he retires
311875 there are family reasons which have also been taken into account
311876 i wanted to be the paolo maldini of psg but that has not been possible its sad to end a career like this
311877 there was nothing detected before and i had a well muscled heart but i was pleased to find out i did not have this condition hypertrophy
311878 i am not here to play pretty but to win titles if we do both thats great
311879 there has never been a situation when roman said we have to play beautiful
311880 i met him twice and we talked like two ordinary people not as owner and coach he said do better for chelsea thats it nothing more
311881 the reasons for our abstention i made clear in our statement have to do with one paragraph that would send the wrong signal at a very important time when we are trying to eliminate the climate of impunity to deal with justice and to address crimes in darfur by suggesting that there might be a way out
311882 research has shown that a fifth of elite female athletes are suffering from an eating disorder but i believe the real figure could be double that so 40 per cent of the female athletes at the beijing olympics could be at risk of an eating disorder and could have gone beyond the normal control and dedication shown by sportswomen it is easy to slip over into that driven compulsion thats when it becomes a mental illness
311883 there is increasing pressure on female athletes to not only perform well but also to look good
311884 the pressure in some sports is particularly strong a good example of that has come in high board diving there has been a large increase in the number of divers with eating disorders since the sport has been televised suddenly instead of just having to look good for those around the pool the athletes now feel as though they have to look good for those watching on television around the world
311885 they are already extremely controlling about what they are eating and are constantly weighing and measuring themselves that is what it takes to win a gold medal but it is also what people do when they have an eating disorder it is all about the difference in purpose but it is difficult to tell in elite athletes does someone have a body like that because they want to win a gold medal or because they would feel useless and disgusting if they looked any different and want to have some emotional control
311886 you are fucking insane if you think you can do this
311887 you know youve only been a jogger to this point finish this race and you join the ranks of a runner

311892 like youre going to be ready to run a 5k in 3 weeks
311893 youre more an athlete now than you were just a few months ago
311894 you may not be able to tackle stupid hills now but 3 months ago you couldnt jog for 60 seconds either
311895 you were drawn to this conspiracy out of greed and a desire for street cred and glory you have not brought glory to your family which is well respected here and in pakistan you have brought shame and disgrace
311896 all that the lord hath spoken will we do and be obedient
311897 for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh
311898 there were such sweet promises brought to my mind they came suddenly as if they were spoken to me

311917 the things which are impossible with men are possible with god
311918 following jesus is simple but not easy love until it hurts and then love more
311919 to love at all is to be vulnerable love anything and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly broken if you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give your heart to no one not even to an animal wrap it careful round with hobbies and little luxuries avoid all entanglements lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness but in that casket safe dark motionless airless it will change it will not be broken it will become unbreakable impenetrable irredeemable the only place outside of heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers of love is hell
311920 you do not do evil to those who do evil to you but you deal with them with forgiveness and kindness

311968 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
311969 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
311970 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
311971 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
311972 would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels

311985 if there is any threat to the separation of powers here it is not from the execution of a search warrant by one co equal branch of government upon another after the independent approval of the third separate and co equal branch
311986 rather the principle of the separation of powers is threatened by the position that the legislative branch enjoys the unilateral and unreviewable power to invoke an absolute privilege thus making it immune from the ordinary criminal process of a validly issued search warrant

311991 we know virtually nothing about this art thats the exciting part of this discovery
311992 what we need to do now is to discover how this art relates to other prehistoric features in the landscape
311993 we are talking about very simple and abstract art using circles lines and triangles mostly the designs are pecked into stone in the shape of simple cups and rings
311994 we are sure there remains a lot that is still undiscovered in cumbria

311998 i think weve gone in the right direction im glad i did my job and hit my marks its a very technical track a lot like indy where its easy to miss one of the corners
311999 right now our first goal is that weve got to make the chase
312000 one thing im proud of this team for is we never want to be fat and happy with six races until the start of the chase theres a lot of time for other guys to figure things out we need to act like a top five team and run like a top five team well reflect on what we accomplished at the end of the year so lets just stay hungry
312001 you want to be smart and not lose him for an extended period
312002 hes relieved but feels that it never should have come to this that cuban had withheld this money really out of spite and it was just unnecessary
312003 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
312004 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him

312052 ive never been to the final of a masters but this looks like my best chance im playing well enough and can hopefully come through
312053 yesterday i drove the ball and couldnt miss a fairway and today i couldnt find one so that was a big difference
312054 i felt very comfortable on the tee i just dont know what happened it just didnt go straight today but my iron play was the same and i putted decent
312055 i feel much much better with the putter much better with the wedges
312056 i hit some great wedge shots today just the basic little chip shots that i expect to get close i havent been performing the way i expected and this week it feels much better i spent last week on short game exclusively and i feel like its starting to come around
312057 it was a big putt because i wanted to go into the weekend with a bit of momentum
312058 i didnt want to bogey the last two but that putt looked good and i felt i could make it
312059 im going to play my heart out and not really be concerned about how phil does hes going to be focused on his game i hope we both have a good day

312062 if you look at ism and the unemployment number together it suggests an economy that is at best stuck in neutral
312063 but we are forecasting continued growth in the economy for the back half of the year and it will be that growth that will determine a return to job creation
312064 with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system a growing credit crunch we need to do more
312065 we are clearly in a growth recession and my fear is that we are in a mild but longer recession than the one we experienced in 2001 2002
312066 overall the report looks to be broadly consistent with other data that show the economy quite soft basically stalled not growing very much but not contracting very much either

312072 if we have to compromise in terms of a drilling strategy that has be carefully written so as to allow for further indefinite obstructions to actually getting any drilling done etc etc
312073 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels

312078 they further affirm that with increased cooperation of iran with the agency to resolve all remaining issues about its past and present nuclear activities the issue of iranian nuclear program should be solely dealt with within the agency framework and there is no legal basis that the un security council proceeds in this regard
312079 the un security council has been clear on irans obligations the iaea has been clear that iran has not been transparent
312080 and now they cant even get their friends from the nam to come out in support of their interpretation of their program it actually reinforces just how isolated they are
312081 we need to stay nimble all the time until we get the gas turned on
312082 the market is going to move this line forward my concern is this license is going to tie the state of alaskas hands were going to be unable to respond

312086 the preview park and its opening proved to be both complicated and very successful
312087 we put mike to an extraordinary test and he passed it with flying colors
312088 the chairman made it very clear he didnt want to make this political in a political year
312089 ellzey seems like a nice guy but compared to the resumes ive seen id say there are a minimum of 10 candidates we should be interviewing before making a decision on a great park ceo
312090 they are just naysayers more interested in throwing sand in the gears than creating the great park
312091 were just doing exactly what has been going on for the last five years since larry agran has been chairman
312092 i want to make sure that the jews here feel comfortable being jewish because it seems that theyre not thats really one of my main goals this coming year is to let them know its ok to be jewish
312093 i have written letters and gone on marches but it isnt working
312094 the prospect of going to prison is very scary but the government is not listening to us and time is running out they are defending the corporations and profit rather than the needs of the citizens so i dont feel like i have a choice
312095 i have kids so of course this is not something that i take lightly at all but we are at a really crucial junction the threat from climate change is profoundly serious
312096 if that involves going to prison and i really really do not want to go then that is what i am prepared to do
312097 i think many more people will now follow in the footsteps of these five and be prepared to go prison to get the message about climate change across
312098 last year the focus was air travel this year it is coal so i think we can expect a lot of activities around the country drawing attention to the issues around energy
312099 it is my job as a parliamentarian to help make law but in this instance i welcome the fact that there are people prepared to break the law
312100 the security service did not look too hard at what was going on
312101 our intelligence and counter terrorism relationship with the us is vital to the national security of the united kingdom
312102 we accept us assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the uk or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the us authorities
312103 the reattachment appears up to now to have proceeded optimally
312104 we had one decapitation some time ago but nothing like this
312105 i dont even know how many times i stabbed her
312106 it was more than once i only stopped when she was dead
312107 i had to get rid of the body quickly the only way out was to cut her up wasnt it it was just like cutting a piece of meat
312108 we dont have any information yet about what exactly she was doing here in brazil
312109 but she knew lots of brazilians from london and she always said that she would like to live in brazil because of the weather london is much colder than it is here and she was curious
312110 he is a drug user and he was always under the effect of drugs and he became very aggressive
312111 my mum had paid for the ticket home and we were looking forward to having her back
312112 i dragged her body into the bathroom then i put the body to one side and i got into the shower and washed then i locked the apartment and went out to the party
312113 she doesnt seem like the kind of girl who would have died without a fight
312114 she was a cool girl with a good heart and like all adolescents she had her crazy side
312115 we have asked the police liaison officer to contact the brazilian embassy and get things speeded up

312120 groups of people are complex in ways that make those groups hard to form and hard to sustain much of the shape of traditional institutions is a response to those difficulties
312121 because the minimum costs of being an organization in the first place are relatively high certain activities may have some value but not enough to make them worth pursuing in any organized way
312122 youre a jew right where are the rest of you gather them all together so i wont have to go over this more than once itll be more efficient that way
312123 in some places the church is ridiculed as the gay church so membership is lost it is experienced as a new form of colonisation
312124 it is seen as leading to sexual license bishops cannot be a symbol for unity when their consecration divides the church in some regions the issue has become a basis for hostile actions
312125 had no idea their action had caused such a negative impact
312126 the revisionists push upon us the view that current secular culture and not the bible should shape our mission and morals
312127 everywhere we go we meet gay and lesbian activists receive their newsletters or read about their events they seem to be supported by north american churches they are determined that their way is the only right way
312128 i felt this year we were destabilised by some clubs who did not completely respect the fair play rules in tapping up players
312129 i feel we suffered from that at the end of the season there is a game going on in europe where the big clubs tap up our players they think they can just come in and take them they offer the players big wages and after they cannot come up with the transfer request they should do it the other way around
312130 when we started talking about my contract i never told wenger id be leaving this club and he knew my desire
312131 if we can do one more signing we will but it will need to be the requested quality
312132 its not just a question of whether to buy its getting the right person and that is at the moment very difficult its not a real problem because we have enough young players who can step in weve lost experience and if we can get a midfielder with experience who can play a tactical role we will do it if not we will give this position to somebody else
312133 when you have many young players you cant keep them all bentley wanted to play more central in the dennis bergkamp role but i felt he wasnt ready he would be ready today
312134 im very confident we have a squad to compete at the top level in the premier league the speculation before the season starts is always against us but we have enough strength to deal with that last year we lost the championship by four points and we feel we have been very very very unlucky this year we want to make another step forward and challenge even more and then win the championship
312135 moy was serving really well and i was making unforced errors the humidity gets to your breathing at the start but i managed to get it together
312136 he was playing too well for me and i was sluggish at the start
312137 but i managed to turn it around with some big serving halfway through the second set when you are playing someone like carlos who can make you do a lot of running you get out of breath quickly and you have to try to make the best of it try to get some cheap points on your serve and i managed to do that in the end
312138 el baile acrob tico parece m s un circo que no una expresi n viva

312142 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
312143 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
312144 i welcome todays bipartisan effort as an important step in the process of reducing our dangerous dependence on foreign oil
312145 any time there is any discharge or leakage of radioactivity or radioactive water no matter how small we report it to local authorities
312146 determined that the weepage may have been occurring as far back as march when the ship was in sasebo japan and late may to mid june when the ship was in guam
312147 the amount of radiation that was in the water that leaked during those three port visits is actually less than what you would find in a 50 pound bag of common lawn fertilizer
312148 if gender based violence is everywhere so is the church
312149 the church is the hope of the world and gods plan for dealing with the problems of the world whether dealing with violence poverty orphans or aids if we dont start with the church we are starting at the wrong end of the equation
312150 where i live in the u s we tend to be quiet about it it is not socially acceptable we dont talk about it but just because it is hidden or quiet doesnt make it right from cambodia to rwanda to women in my own church it is everywhere
312151 we have to ask ourselves what can the church do
312152 there is only so much governments ngos and relief organizations can do we have to speak up for those who have no voice

312155 as you know shia was involved in a traffic collision last sunday he and his passenger were struck by another vehicle as shia was completing a left turn the force of that impact immediately flipped shias vehicle over and as a result shias left hand was crushed we have continued to cooperate with the police and the sheriffs department has now released information that the other vehicle ran the red light while striking shias truck our independent investigation of the accident is ongoing but we have also received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 mph and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident shia and his family are very thankful for the efforts of medical personnel at the scene and for all the care and understanding that we have received at cedars sinai medical center shia underwent four hours of surgery on sunday and has been recovering since then his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications shias left arm remains fully immobilized from the elbow down and he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work we are hopeful that this return will be sooner rather than later and the transformers 2 production company has rearranged their shooting schedule to accommodate this injury we remain very grateful for their understanding we are very appreciative again of the patience that everyone has shown us and of the many concerned citizens who have stepped forward to provide information regarding this collision we would encourage anyone who has information to contact mr norris office at the telephone number listed below so that our investigators may follow up
312156 theyve increased credit loss expectations for the past three quarters and this next one is probably going to be the fourth
312157 turbulent market conditions lie ahead would probably be an understatement
312158 the revised cdc figure represents an unacceptable level of new hiv infections for a preventable disease the revised estimate underlines the need for a national aids strategy with measurable outcomes reliance on evidence based programs and sufficient funding
312159 stopping the spread of hiv and treating all people living with hiv must be a high priority for our leaders and the american public
312160 the higher estimate of annual new hiv infections does not mean that hiv prevention does not work what is failing is national leadership to fund and support sound scientifically effective hiv prevention programs
312161 this is not just another set of statistics there are people behind these numbers people are becoming infected with a disease that is preventable we know how to prevent hiv but we have been fighting this epidemic with one hand tied behind our back reflecting a disturbing dismissal of hiv prevention as a public health priority
312162 the new higher estimate is yet one more wake up call to our national leaders that they need to do more starting with developing and implementing a real national aids strategy

312172 with this resolution we take up an effort that began more than 150 years ago when visionary women came together to stand up for womens rights to better the status of women in our society in this tradition more than 11 years ago i first introduced the legislation that we consider this morning the paycheck fairness act and i cannot help but think of all the aprils we have commemorated equal pay day without legislative movement but today the legislative inertia we have experienced for years have come to an end the wage gap is real over the course of her lifetime a female high school graduate will make 700 000 less than the young man she graduates with compared to a man a female college graduate stands to lose up to 2 million in the course of her career this is true across the board
312173 these congressional approval ratings are worse than we had on the eve of losing the majority

312175 rohrabacher has voted to increase his own pay 10 times in 11 years while voting himself 90 000 in pay raises hes voted against equal pay for women against access to birth control against head start programs and against health care for children dana rohrabachers record on womens issues is clear he doesnt care at all about the health and well being of the women in his district
312176 this is the third time in just the last couple of weeks that congressman wolf has voted against hardworking americans and hardworking families in virginia and i have to say as a woman this particular vote is the most offensive to me
312177 not only is this an issue of basic fairness but as families try to deal with stressful economic times equal pay for women is also about helping millions of families meet their needs on a daily basis
312178 shadegg keeps showing us that he is one of the most conservative members of congress that votes with bush nearly 100 percent of the time and this clearly is one of the worst examples yet shadegg epitomizes what is wrong with congress and he made that loud and clear yesterday that and its time to elect new leadership
312179 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
312180 my opinion of pat has changed over the years i used to think he was truly a man of the people but the longer he has been mayor the less i think of him as with most cities charlotte has three political parties dem rep and chamber of commerce pat is definitely the puppet of the coc here what is good for business is good for charlotte and pat very personable guy he has gotten a bunch of dems in these parts to vote for him but i dont trust him
312181 in both cases a us plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the us facility in diego garcia
312182 the detainees did not leave the plane and the us government have assured us that no us detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
312183 us investigations show no record of any other rendition through diego garcia or any other overseas territory or through the uk itself since then
312184 the official a frequent participant in white house situation room meetings after september 11 who has since left government says a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being held and interrogated on the island
312185 according to this account the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
312186 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
312187 given everything we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the us did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
312188 our intelligence and counter terrorism relationship with the us is vital to the national security of the united kingdom
312189 we accept us assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the uk or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the us authorities
312190 todays time story further demonstrates that the british government has allowed itself to be duped by the us on a colossal scale
312191 while ministers have spent years looking the other way british territory has been used for kidnapping extraordinary rendition illegal imprisonment and possibly torture

312199 i think youve overpaid for executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome
312200 they can regain my confidence but theyre going to have to prove themselves first
312201 competition is good for the industry and for consumers so i am happy that microsoft did not succeed in acquiring yahoo
312202 yahoo has actively participated in these human rights abuses including the censorship of information and in one case turning over information to the chinese government
312203 i believe you are moral but the only morality you believe in is profit and self interest

312245 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
312246 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
312247 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
312248 you needed that job but they had to give it to a minority
312249 the hands that once picked cotton can now pick a president
312250 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed
312251 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
312252 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 dollars of immediate relief
312253 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
312254 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
312255 excuse me young man this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later
312256 why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community or black community in this country
312257 i think youre misinformed when you say not one time

312272 sen obama are there specific ways you will change the way things are done in washington or will you reinvent the wheel
312273 sen mccain why should we trust you to lead diplomatic efforts in the world when you seem so incapable of diplomacy
312274 either one of you how would the relationship between executive and legislative branches differ from the present one under your administration
312275 why no bump in the polls after obama spends time with tiger sharks

312477 his knee was a little inflamed today so we kept him off
312478 what i said is you have to be a little bit lucky fortunate and healthy like i said in the two super bowl years we lost 10 starters games one year and we lost 15 starters games the next year last year we lost 72 ive got some high expectations for this team and hopefully we will get there
312479 same thing a little tight his groin was a little sore we kept him off the last two periods he practiced everything except the last two
312480 its a great tribute to gary and this organization obviously the first super bowl we won he was a big part of that like i said hes a guy we never had to worry about making a play you dont say that very often in the national football league especially at that left tackle position i gave an illustration of this one where his shoulders popped and he refused to come out until john elway did that gives you an idea of how tough he was as well we will be down there in canton ohio with about nine or 10 coaches that were with gary we are looking forward to it
312481 i dont know tom is such a tough guy when hes feels like hes ready to go hell go when that will be i really dont know hes smart when you get older you understand what you can do and what you cant do there is a difference between being injured and being hurt tom knows the difference so when he can play hell be back in the lineup
312482 thats the reason we signed him not only was he a veteran player but we thought he was kind of the nuts and bolts of the offensive line at kansas city all these years i dont how many snaps he made in a row he was a guy that held that offensive line together a lot of years he did a very respectable job at kansas city having him on our football team and playing the way he has is a plus for us
312483 obviously we talk about a lot of things the main thing is we just want to get better every day there is not just one thing in training camp what we are trying to do is get better every day as a team and focus on the now dont worry about what happened in the past and just worry about whats happening in the future if guys go out there with that mindset then you have a chance to play a little football
312484 i dont know ill tell you when his weight is down his weight is not down right now when his weight does go down to the weight that we wanted then hell be out there practicing
312485 anytime you give guys an opportunity to get in front of you its never good ill answer that question when he comes back
312486 they are doing a good job not much experience there but playing very well im hoping we have one of the better offensive lines weve had in a long time
312487 everyone would leave with the memory that there was no place else in the world and this was where they always belonged wed do it all because we have to not because we know why beyond a gender race and class we could find what really holds us back lets make everybody sing that they are the beginning and ending of everything that we all are stronger than everything they taught us that we should fear

312495 at the end of the day the question is has the person received a fair trial if there are deficiencies in the summing up and the way it proceeds the defence is entitled to proceed and i am saying there are matters to be canvassed
312496 it was incredibly complex evidence and the most complex summing up i have ever heard a judge have to give to get through the other end of a second trial is a hell of a relief
312497 i dont sit before you today to ask that you ban the paparazzi
312498 im asking you to regulate it officialize it tax it legitimize it i dont want to beg the city of los angeles to give me 1987 back i love being a famous musician in 2008 this is about safety
312499 law governing an acceptable filming distance from an unwilling subject to keep everybody safe and misbehavior accountable
312500 the behavior of the paparazzi is out of control it needs to be reined in
312501 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
312502 when you pick up a 2 foot 8 inch human being and throw him to the floor it hurts
312503 id love to see a picture of williams and mikey m in the same place at the same time
312504 hey i own the freedom why dont you give me 1 000 and let me stay at your house and ill give you a 1 3 of the team
312505 you sit back in your recliner and wait for the phone to ring see who has what kind of news im not really worried about it at all whatever is going to happen is going to happen what i hope happens is they get the needed investors or find the correct owners to fund this thing long term
312506 its like relationships the city has been dating a football team now theyre on their third football team in three years theyre tired of dating let them get hungry for a relationship again let them yearn for something this community is just tired
312507 i was one of the people who had guessed that the team would fold before the first game but i was incorrect
312508 heres my couple of pennies it would speak volumes for this team to make a great showing in the playoffs and even bring home a championship which is a legitimate possibility
312509 fort wayne is a city that just wants to watch guys play football purely for the love of the game
312510 id rather be a great team in a bad league than no team at all
312511 its great to have land back fans are going to see some things that have yet to be experienced on the field this season
312512 i think that any attendance on the sixth home game not including the exhibition is positive
312513 because at least on paper it worked very well about three years ago with big crowds
312514 we just think with the proper management it should work well and the proper promotional effort
312515 offered to take the freedom over but were not going to pay their debt and their expenses
312516 we need help for what i call the emotional football fort wayne native people who have the wherewithal to support something that returns a value to them either personally or to their business or their family or the community
312517 theres many people like that any time you go the general public and say we need your support and thats all we need its somewhat unfounded support and its not long lasting what we need to say is we will do what we can to increase the value if we average 2 600 we think we should 4 200 to 4 800 next year and maybe more especially based on if the offseason is favorable and our product is good to begin the season itll snowball
312518 at the time we started it no one else was doing it
312519 there wasnt a lot of reliable information out there about the flu
312520 we thought the contributions ought to be put together by everyone because something as wide ranging as a pandemic involves more than just the health department
312521 if you have to close the schools down in a pandemic parents have to know where to pick up their kids they need to know where they can get food and electricity it goes well beyond the virus itself
312522 one of the things we have accomplished is pushing governmental entities to be more transparent
312523 im not sure there would have even been a pandemicflu gov if it hadnt been for our site
312524 this is the wisdom of crowds everyone gets a chance to look at it if theres false information it needs to be corrected
312525 it was started to share information between associates in cardiology
312526 i didnt intend it to be shared throughout the world but it took on a life of its own
312527 its something that has potential to provide up to date medical information
312528 i have a wall of textbooks but sometimes you need more current information a textbook costs us 300 and by the time it comes out its out of date
312529 medicine has lagged behind other professions in its use of technology
312530 whatever we can do to make things more efficient we should do
312531 i wanted to use the power of a wiki for surgical knowledge
312532 doctors need an online resource that they can access at any time in a hospital in the old days they would rely on books but these get out of date and pages go missing so a wiki provides a great opportunity to close that information gap
312533 they have to submit a cv curriculum vitae of their credentials be approved by the site editors and also confirm their e mail address when an article is posted it can be approved by an editor and this status is shown
312534 after 35 years i am going to be visiting korea this october i can only imagine all the changes that i will encounter my question is what sort of precautions should one take with the food these days i e only bottled water only hotel food yuck and etc another question i have is about msg my wife is very sensitive to it and i would like to know the various korean words for it so i can tell our server to leave it out i imagine it is as difficult to avoid today as it was long ago as kimchi and most everything else uses it feel free to use hangul to write the words our as i still read it but my conversational abilities are limited oh yeah one other thing can you get makkoli or dong dong jyu in seoul and where is the best cha chang myun thanks and sugo haseiyo

312540 u s sen barack obama said today he would be willing to open floridas coast for more oil drilling if it meant winning approval for broad energy changes my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices obama said
312541 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done obama said

312548 an attack on iran will most likely lead to great carnage in the middle east and beyond as supporters of iran resort to suicide bombings in retaliation there might well be large scale iranian collateral casualties an attack would strengthen the iranian regime and license a smash down on its critics including working class critics inside iran it would throw iraq back into the worst chaos
312549 duff anti imperialism pretend one sided pacifism and hysterical appeals to international law and the un
312550 however least of all should we back ahmedinejad or argue implicitly or openly that homocidal religious lunatics have a right to arm themselves with nuclear weapons and that those they say they want to destroy should be condemned for refusing to stand idly by while they ie the iranian regime jd arm themselves to do the job

312572 everyday google sells several 10 millions in pay per clicks but i get all mine absolutely free and now
312573 and how 100s of regular people have followed my lead and used my breakthough secret to earning larger profits due to eliminating their pay per click ad costs
312574 i love your secret for placing ppc google ads but for free i have grown my business now to earning for me a passive 600 a day profit before i was just getting by but now using your secret technique for getting free pay per clicks at all search engines my business has been able to take off
312575 i am so grateful to you for releasing your secret to the rest of us who have been struggling just to make a buck online
312576 what can i say but way to go ive been online since the big dot com explosion of the mid 90s and have made just a tad of wealth but never anything as of late like this and thanks wholly to your secret method for getting ppcs free
312577 my costs have always been rather high and a tough balancing act to say the least
312578 now with your help ive been able to dissolve nearly 2 million a year that ordinarily would have gone towards advertising but
312579 i was beginning to give up but now i have the goose that lays golden eggs all day long thanks to you
312580 i made good on the net last year but didnt get rich by any means but this year is very different as after applying your secret to getting highly targeted google and yahoo ads i have now boosted my advertising efforts to a much larger degree
312581 this has had the effect that now i have built a most impressive inhouse customer list while selling more of my product line
312582 thanks for opening the secret of secrets at least as far as getting ppcs is concerned
312583 i got your secret system for placing google ads free of costs and at first was sure it couldnt be for real
312584 my wife and i tore it apart and then it hit us that this was so easy we kicked ourselves in the head for not seeing this secret ourselves
312585 now thats all we do is plan adwords campaigns for more products than we even had to start with and the result has been an explosion in our online business
312586 we just surpassed our best record with over 32 670 in pure 110 profits from the internet
312587 i just cant believe i didnt figure this out for myself
312588 ha my mom is eating her shorts im a 19 yr old single mom working out of my home and using your secret i have now been able to make a killing on the internet
312589 i started out slowly using your secret until i got the hang of it
312590 just last month i topped over 61 000 just from my little ole pc in the corner of my living room
312591 i got your secret and put it to work within 24 hours
312592 within 3 weeks of starting i had no advertising costs with google whatsoever and still had 993 keywords running strong
312593 ordinarily this would have cost me an arm or a leg but now i get all this incredible advertising free just like you promised
312594 so powerful is your system that even without pushing it to what i
312595 what are you trying to do make everybody bill gates
312596 i ordered perry marshalls stuff which is grand in itself but your twist on all of it is the most exciting thing ive ever seen
312597 what ticks me off though is that after reading your ebook i couldnt believe i had never thought of how to do
312598 i now am more than confident that i will be very very rich as soon as just six months from now
312599 i doubted the whole thing when i read what you said about being able to advertise on google of all places free
312600 had we shook on a bet id be piss poor right about now cuz youd be the winner hands down mr cohen
312601 now though i consider myself armed and dangerous because i think of your secret as the best marketing weapon ever developed for aggressive advertisers
312602 man this is so easy and simple why didnt i think of this first i could now be selling this secret to the world and making a killing
312603 is just sitting here waiting for you all you need to do is click below and download directly to your desktop and my secret becomes yours instantly

312606 i would go gay for kate winslet i saw her across the room at a party once she is the sexiest woman on the planet
312607 i have to admit chris i was pretty sceptical when i heard about your latest system i was sceptical that it would be easy for me to clone the hottest clickbank campaigns using your 3 step
312608 imagine the million dollar affiliate and his google nemesis tool kit at your service 24 7 remember that i am going to be holding your hand through the entire process this exclusive club has been setup so that there is no room for error you literally are forced to copy the moves of a clickbank dynamo

312633 once again shaws is demonstrating that the bottom line means more than people by offering a substandard wage package shifting an excessive amount of health care costs too workers and eliminating their pension plan
312634 the union recognizes its a very competitive retail market in new england but shaws continues to maintain a very strong position in that market
312635 given shaws performance and place in the market we feel their proposals reach far too deeply into the pockets of their own workers
312636 local 791 has worked hard to address many of the companys issues throughout these negotiations but what the company is asking from our members is unrealistic as well as unfair the goal of local 791s negotiating committee is to work diligently to get a contract that we can recommend to our members however if we are unable to recommend an agreement to our members and they reject the companys offer we are prepared to set up picket lines
312637 there are 25 guys down there right now that feel like a team
312638 it hasnt felt like that for a while and you have to feel like that in professional sports to perform at your best
312639 it didnt seem like we were handling the challenge up to what we needed to
312640 its an exciting time to stand in front of your players
312641 i had numerous people try to help me with my bags at the airport
312642 im going to try to do what i can do i think im equipped to handle that
312643 i dont think its fair of me to sit here today and look back and comment on why manny was unhappy its a question for manny
312644 he had a remarkable run here hes one of the best right handed hitters in history
312645 if i was a free agent i couldnt have picked a better place to go
312646 we were having a difficult time and it wasnt any one persons fault
312647 there was doubt there was even exhaustion on the part of some players and a pretty major distraction
312648 manny and i were friends of course im going to miss him
312649 after the last couple of races we had its great to have some luck come our way
312650 this feels fantastic and is exactly the result this team deserved
312651 weve been really strong and led the last few races but just didnt have the luck that we needed to break through
312652 sponsors and business wise the wec was better for me
312653 versus replays the fights two to four times a month so its better exposure for my sponsors
312654 but nothings really changed i got the belt showed it to my family and friends and they all got to take pictures with it but then i put the belt in the closet im acting like i dont have it im training like im fighting to get it
312655 hes a boxer with a good jiu jitsu game hes strong and hes beaten everyone down
312656 my footwork will be the key and i have to take him to the deep water late rounds of the scheduled five round title fight
312657 i used mma to help with my training for wrestling
312658 id do jiu jitsu and kickboxing and then id spend a few days a week on wrestling it kept me training for wrestling and then id take fights during the summer
312659 the longer the fight goes the better my chances are of winning
312660 hes never been out of the second round ive gone into the third round with razor rob and with franca
312661 without these real estate related losses and loan write downs surrounding the small builder and construction related commercial segments of the portfolio affected by the repercussions of the countrys housing market meltdown net income would have been 3 42 million as of june 2008 a decrease of only 17 6 from the same period last year
312662 net earnings have been impacted for the first six months of 2008 primarily due to the banks vigilance in addressing the risk exposure in a segment of our loan portfolio impacted by the weakness in the homebuilding industry and the slowing economy
312663 you get a hangover this quick i dont think thats an excuse give their pitchers credit they pitched a good ballgame they played well and they beat us
312664 we had a lot of guys on base and we just didnt get key hits with men in scoring position
312665 when you do that youre not going to win ballgames
312666 overall whenever you go seven and give up one run and keep your team in the game especially against a guy like peavy its going to be a low scoring game and youve got to keep them in the game
312667 theres going to have to be people who step up
312668 weve talked about this for years getting a chance to do this i never thought it would actually happen so many things in the big leagues have to line up to be on the same team as your brother this is great
312669 whatever happened in boston is in the past im excited man i cant wait i feel like i took 5 000 pounds off my back
312670 its just a new chapter in my life im happy to be here thats all i can say las a great city im happy to be a dodger
312671 i want to say something from the bottom of my heart
312672 i want to thank the fans in boston i love you guys i just want to move on im thinking blue right now im thinking about the dodgers i want people to judge me on what i do here not what i did in boston
312673 im going to start maybe stealing some bases i dont go deep anymore i just hit line drives to right field
312674 can i go and get something to eat get ready for the game
312675 im like a little kid now im kind of nervous
312676 im just going to be manny and play the game
312677 in our hearts it is and in the mexican community it was 66 then it went to 99 in a matter of minutes it was all through the agent scott boras and his staff
312678 ive played a lot against him ill let you know in a month we went through some conversation
312679 clean it up a little bit and make it manageable
312680 ive got to cut it im going to be looking like a baby
312681 i dont want them to treat me different than the other guys if they want me to cut it ill cut it it will grow back
312682 you have to separate the desire to get out of boston and the desire to get out of the situation
312683 im just going to play hard well see what happens
312684 i am thankful that west point affords the opportunity to undergo an annual physical
312685 it was through the course of this physical that an irregularity in my psa test was diagnosed i elected to undergo surgery to remove the cancer as soon as possible
312686 fortunately it appears the doctors were able to diagnose things early and they expect me to enjoy a complete recovery
312687 i am excited to return to coach the team during preseason camp and expect to be back out on the practice field next week
312688 hes been working at it and hes getting better but hes still a long way from being that shortstop that can go to his left and to his right
312689 basically we talked to him about this yesterday and he was resistant to it based on the fact that he was getting better and he felt that he could help the ballclub
312690 even though he may be able to play in 12 days instead of 15 i think we can take this luxury now that we have manny and weve got a little more bench strength hes just taking one for the team basically
312691 i am not here to play pretty but to win titles if we do both thats great
312692 there has never been a situation when roman said we have to play beautiful
312693 i met him twice and we talked like two ordinary people not as owner and coach he said do better for chelsea thats it nothing more
312694 by faith abraham when he was called obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance and he went out not knowing where he was going
312695 every daughter who comes into possession of an inheritance of any tribe of the sons of israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father so that the sons of israel each may possess the inheritance of his fathers
312696 no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another tribe for the tribes of the sons of israel shall each hold to his own inheritance
312697 during this momentous time all possessions would be relinquished back to its original owner
312698 when the jubilee of the sons of israel comes then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong so their inheritance will be withdrawn from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers
312699 and thou shall number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years then shall thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family
312700 and names were written on the which are those of the twelve tribes of the sons of israel
312701 but if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants it shall be his until the year of liberty then it shall return to the prince his inheritance shall be only his sons it shall belong to them
312702 wait on god and he will work but dont wait in spiritual sulks because you cannot see an inch in front of you are we detached enough from our own spiritual hysterics to wait on god to wait is not to sit with folded hands but to learn to do what we are told

312721 offensively were tuning some things up weve got two more games before the real deal starts
312722 and kobe takes on the challenge of guarding their best perimeter player regardless of who it is regardless if hes a point guard 2 3 4 whatever it is
312723 he had a great game against us a few years ago the u s a and was real brash about it
312724 i knew prior to it and they reminded me of it so sic the doberman on him
312725 i think it started with dwight early in the game he got it going on the defensive end which led over to the offensive end once he holds it down in the middle like that we feed off of that
312726 kobe locked him up he got a couple of open shots throughout the course of the game but when kobe was on him i dont think he scored
312727 i think he was actually a little tentative to shoot the ball when kobe was on him
312728 no im not i took a life he cant go to his daughters wedding he cant walk her down the aisle
312729 when i was 15 years old i shot my high school principal i never meant for this to happen he grabbed me from behind and i got scared i was already pretty stressed so that freaked me out even more please dont get me wrong i am not blaming mr klang for grabbing me but i am blaming him the teachers social services and the school as a whole for never listening to me no one ever listened

312734 and believe me london is by no means at the forefront of cycling
312735 you have to be much more careful here than in london because the drivers here are so much more hostile
312736 apparently he is quite hostile to cyclists but i cant understand how anyone in this day and age can be like that particularly with petrol prices going up
312737 i think you need a serious education campaign its a matter of creating a culture where its acceptable to cycle
312738 once you start putting in the infrastructure like bike lanes and signs and give cyclists priority then drivers will accept them
312739 sydney has around 2000 kilometres of cycle facilities while london only has 550 kilometres

312755 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me

312760 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
312761 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
312762 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

312892 ours is a long term investment so we dont get involved in the day to day chatter in the marketplace

312894 on this premise we believe the company should consider a privatization

312991 debt management schemes do not effectively deal with personal insolvency problems and the process can prolong the issue with individuals still forced into bankruptcy at a later date

313018 this film is about taking the action to the next level while using all the classic constructs of ninja movies
313019 i was asked to do it and it was an the script was amazing you really care about the journey these characters go on
313020 after the first film i ended up sitting next to the director on a plane he promised me that if we did a sequel both cillian murphy and i would return i was heartbroken to not be in the sequel
313021 i read the script and was excited i love guys films and thats why i did this one

313038 maybe ill do them as a side dish id saute them quickly and serve them with butter or chicken stock or maybe ill braise them and serve them with fingerling potatoes seared black sea bass and the zucchini blossoms stuffed with ratatouille
313039 after three months i was calling out all the tickets in french
313040 i went to the food and beverage director and said i really want the chef position and he said well do a tasting

313046 reports of the imminent demise of the auction market seem to be greatly exaggerated again analyst kevin conery wrote in a feb
313047 we continue to be impressed by the auction markets resiliency
313048 co opted during a seven month drive by the new york based firms sales force to prevent a meltdown in the 330 billion market massachusetts secretary of state william galvin alleged this week in an administrative complaint filed in boston
313049 come on down and visit us in the vomitorium the auction rate desks managing director frances constable wrote to a co worker in august as demand began to dry up
313050 market is collapsing another executive cited in galvins complaint said in a november 2007 personal e mail
313051 make good on sales of now frozen holdings compensate investors who disposed of their bonds or shares at a loss and pay an unspecified fine he has already filed a related claim against zurich based ubs ag
313052 research analysts routinely soft pedaled significant negative events affecting liquidity in the auction markets he said in the complaint
313053 the auction markets were not functioning properly and were in fact in significant danger of collapsing
313054 six figure bonus for 2007 after his year end review credited him for
313055 ultimately his work contributed to better liquidity and lower inventory levels in the marketplace the reviewer said
313056 nothing the sales desk could do or couldnt do affected how much these analysts earned or their standing in our research department
313057 hard put like some other variable rate securities which obligate the issuer to arrange a purchaser for any unwanted securities when rates reset
313058 i had not seen this piece until just now and it may single handedly undermine the auction market she wrote in capital letters according to galvins claim
313059 the same facts contained in the first report were all retained in a longer fuller and clearer version herr said
313060 just think of the differences today a young person gets interested in chemistry and is given a chemistry set but it doesnt contain potassium cyanide it doesnt even contain copper sulphate or anything else interesting because all the interesting chemicals are considered dangerous substances therefore these budding young chemists dont have a chance to do anything engrossing with their chemistry sets as i look back i think it is pretty remarkable that mr ziegler this friend of the family would have so easily turned over one third of an ounce of potassium cyanide to me an 11 year old boy
313061 i think the laziness is the underlying reason why we dont legalize it laziness is down
313062 sure ryder its because brian wilson is an alien ask anybody
313063 178 you seem to be saying that many deaths are ok on one side due to benefit and you are asking how
313064 the most dangerous thing about marijuana use isnt the drug itself but what will happen to your life
313065 remember when everybody liked bush for awhile basically because there had been a terror
313066 further the taxation of pot and the subsequent increase in its usage probably wouldnt make up for
313067 anyone have any clue how surf music and sci fi became intertwined theres alot of stuff like this
313068 yes that would be les horribles cernettes or lhc for short
313069 nana ti ricordi la prima volta che ci siamo incontrate

313072 theres no frills no extras theres only everything thats needed is included and theres no extras in there
313073 we kept the tax payers in mind because we wanted to have the least impact on taxpayers as possible
313074 we want to be very upfront with our taxpayers about that and not say its only 59 6
313075 none of use want to pay taxes or see them increase but i believe this is gonna be the most bang for the buck
313076 the taxpayers will be disappointed at first that does worry me especially when you ask for a 2 1 2 cent increase in property value tax but really we dont have a choice here
313077 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
313078 well never see the old entertainment days of las vegas again
313079 corporate says that every department has to make money so you cant experiment and take chances thats the bottom line todays performers feel that they dont need las vegas to sell records or to be successful what i mean by that is that they dont have to perform a few nights at a hotel they can do a concert and thats enough or they can get paid to make an appearance at an ultra lounge and get just as much publicity
313080 playing vegas can help an act as long as it is the right venue years ago it meant something to headline a hotel but times have changed playing the house of blues or the pearl helps most of the others places could hurt an act
313081 weve been doing it for along time and selling it out each weekend
313082 its certainly an easier production it also gives our patron a choice of how to spend their entertainment dollar especially with the high cost of the production show ticket this way they can afford to see one of our cirque shows and then choose from one of our many other shows
313083 not easy finding emerging talent newer performers today play it safe by being the opening for a major concert artist so its difficult to find anyone willing to take a chance
313084 to be fair its a question i cant answer its mind boggling and it sure beats doing risky broadway shows theyre a great marketing tool for hotels theyre the preeminent show producers with the most talented people willing to spend unbelievable amounts of money you cant ask for more
313085 i want to be in vegas i need to be in vegas
313086 this is in your face comedy and an all you can stand laugh fest
313087 i promise to get all the paperwork in order well release the silverton from all responsibility and liability and well return to perform the escape i have to do it
313088 then i have to be able to get my hand outside the exposed bar and pick one lock and then unravel an un known combination of a second lock and then get to the surface without blowing out my eardrums from the pressure
313089 this has never been done before underwater i have to hold my breath and the steel box which is no larger than an animal luggage box used on airlines gives me absolutely no room for movement
313090 ive trained myself to hold my breath for up to four minutes underwater but with all the exertion of getting out of the metal cuffs on my hands and feet the air gets used up much faster if i could get out in 30 seconds believe me i would but it takes almost the length of the hold of my breath theres not much room for safety
313091 houdini did this escape once in a wooden box with no openings he had it lowered into a murky river so nobody could see anything ive been called the 21st century houdini and i wanted my fans to see me inside the box and getting free
313092 inside every empowered woman is a pussycat doll purring and hissing her way out they have that special kind of confidence every woman can understand what that means and live that philosophy every day every woman wants to be sexy and feel sexy its all about a girl who is very confident and loves to get dressed up like a doll not trashy or slutty but somebody who everyday whether walking down the street or going to the store just owns it with attitude and empowerment a pussycat doll gets up on stage and performs with that same confidence that every woman can have with the same feeling and same vibe about owning every day owning your womanhood its easier today for women to seize this empowerment and enjoy it it wasnt so easy in years gone by because they had to hide and cover up their strengths and just show weakness thank goodness times have changed and weve now got that power
313093 in the pussycat dolls lounge everything is carefully choreographed but in the casino i didnt just want a go go dancer without dance training you can make go go dancing look so much better if you have that training its the same kind of girl but in the pit they have to provide a theatrical performance at the same time as the dancing i am really happy with them theyre energetic appealing and sexy in my wildest dreams i never would have imagined us being part of a casino its so incredible their outfits in the gaming pit pictured above are not exactly the same as in the lounge i designed uniform styled outfits that are just as sexy but somewhat different and now we will be selling merchandise and pcd lingerie inspired by those costumes
313094 pure already is home to the las vegas pussycat dolls lounge and now this casino is the final part of a dream come true i began the pussycat dolls 12 years ago but only dreamed about opening a casino the last few years you always think something could go wrong and its not going to happen but honestly everything was completely smooth with this venture my partners at caesars and pure were great and i cant believe we are actually here this is such a new chapter in my life and the life of the dolls incidentally our tv show search for the next pussycat doll premieres on tuesday in the tv show we use all our vegas casino fun stuff to tie in with the show a lot of the lingerie will start in the pit and lead to the lounge and then to your own home
313095 were tackling that competition head on its the same demographic and with a nightclub on the gaming floor weve got them beat these are just beautiful women they are not being suggestive or vulgar we watch that very carefully and dancing up a storm theyre even sexier with their clothes still on the reaction is incredible its far more than we ever expected the energy and excitement is terrific and everybody male and female young and old enjoys and welcomes their special brand of glitz and glamour we had our soft opening back on super bowl weekend and its just gone from strength to strength the numbers are really solid our dealers have great personalities and upbeat positive attitudes its become another must see attraction at caesars this has been such a big success leading up to tonights official celebrity opening that were now going to expand the 9pm 4am hours and start from noon everyday right throughout march madness well then keep the pussycats casino open much longer than we have been

313098 i enjoy working intuitively with the very structure of line and all the many creative methods of developing them into forms and images as well as how they interact with space i move over the entire surface in one continuous creative process bringing life to the lines going where my hand wants to take them they are like the fibers of life a bombardment of creation always surrounding us
313099 drs lund and randall are outstanding and well respected immunologists with the rare ability to move science through all the paces of translational research including unraveling basic functions testing them in disease and generating pre clinical models to ultimately gain insights into human disease
313100 they will greatly enhance our ability to study a number of human autoimmune and infectious diseases and we are very fortunate that they have chosen the university as their new home
313101 right now b cell depletion therapy is being tried for several autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis lupus multiple sclerosis and diabetes
313102 but were finding out that b cells do a lot of things by understanding more about b cells it might be possible to better target potential therapies and develop better treatments
313103 a lot of people think of lymph nodes simply as bags of b cells and t cells
313104 but really these are very sophisticated highly organized structures and surprisingly weve found them in several types of tissue the questions now are what are they doing there and can we take advantage of them to improve human health
313105 its important to learn about them so we can try to enhance their activity when desired such as when a patient is fighting an infection or inhibit their activity such as in someone who has a chronic disease like asthma

313111 complex climate models are tools that provide insights and knowledge into how future climate may evolve to assure that future climate projections are used appropriately it is crucial to understand what current models can simulate well and where models need improvements
313112 this report makes an important contribution in helping to describe and explain the current state of high end climate modeling for the non specialist
313113 the science of climate modeling has matured through finer spatial resolution the inclusion of a greater number of physical processes and through comparison to a rapidly expanding array of observations
313114 an average over the set of models clearly provides climate simulation superior to any individual model
313115 no current model is superior to others in all respects but rather different models have differing strengths and weaknesses

313379 it was a matter of time when he was going to make this breakthrough and just gain the experience with the time
313380 hes one of the young rising stars that we expect to see more in the future
313381 i think i can win a masters series and id love to do it this week
313382 i played well last week and had a tight match against nadal
313383 this week im playing well again you know hopefully i can do it

313385 ive never been to the final of a masters but this looks like my best chance im playing well enough and can hopefully come through
313386 im so angry with myself that i couldnt at least wait until i got home to shed a few damn tears
313387 you think id be okay with it by now weve all got to get on with our lives after all and im not even supposed to consider some things especially not with any of my team most especially not when both of us are in the military
313388 come back to my place for ice cream and wine cassies at lorens place both our shifts are nearly over

313392 thats a dumb attribute to try and live up to anyway imagine what itd be like if no one in the military was emotional sam hell youve probably seen it out there
313393 i cant afford to be in love with him no one can afford for me to be in love with him and i mean that literally
313394 and are you really still in love with him or
313395 did you always have an idea that i was wasting my time completely
313396 sam he rescued you half a dozen times too he does care for you i wasnt sure you were wasting your time not absolutely sure
313397 but they chase each other from light years away nothing stops them daniel even came to him when he was ascended twice i mean i know he dropped in on tealc too and i get that he would have rescued me if id needed his help at any point too i know that i love him like a brother this doesnt change that but they can talk so freely they always know what each others about deep down even when the others trying to blank stuff out they always hit the nail on the head so to speak in every confrontation or dilemma always and their loyalty their loyalty is awesome
313398 like it is when youre in love janet why do i always want what i cant have
313399 i bet they thought they could never have each other either but you cant help loving even if you have to deny it so why should you always have to its a part of most of us love that is and it makes us act whether we admit it or not but most of the time it makes us stronger better people i know perhaps i shouldnt be reminding you that you lost out but what i mean is you can have what you want as long as its right for you dont go chasing after what isnt
313400 after the eighth album im done i already feel it i love acting i love my music like i said but i feel it after this one probably one more in me and thats eight like im one album behind nas and thats crazy
313401 its funny because everybody always wants to talk about you know bow wow doesnt curse hes clean which is true
313402 i think a lot of people that are jumping on bow wow now are new people and if you listen to my first album i was being bad on my first album
313403 i still have the younger generation the younger kids look up to me then again i have that other fanbase who was with me from the jump who are now adults too and its almost like i gotta cater to both but if i miss one of em theyll go find that other person to fill that slot
313404 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it
313405 the ladies are gonna go crazy when they see bow wows first sex scene its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front
313406 it was with a porn star i dont know her name
313407 she probably watching this like what i did a scene with him and he doesnt remember my name nah i dont remember her name but she was bad though she was baaaaad i was cool i was comfortable with it i was definitely comfortable with it it is what it is normal stuff that happens
313408 his two fingers are pretty mashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it in the story
313409 he was not drunk he was drinking hours and hours before

313413 something sexy and edgy something where i get to use a knife
313414 you dont really believe in the concept of personal space do you
313415 dealing with the press is something that youve gotta start getting used to
313416 and you know people want something to talk about so theyre going to have the two disney girls or three disney girls kind of feuding
313417 theres no feud theres nothing to feud about so why start a fight
313418 its something that we all have to live with and unfortunately it involves friends
313419 im not interested in being anybody but myself and im not here to replace anyone
313420 i think that shes a wonderful performer and of course its a compliment but i would like to take a different route
313421 i would love to step out of disney and maybe do a couple of roles maybe challenging roles and fun roles new things like that
313422 we believe the terms of this agreement will provide strong protection to our brand worldwide
313423 it was pretty much the same with the last record
313424 weve been working on acoustic guitars and then trying to bring it all together as a full band were not sure whats going to happen yet but weve been having a lot of fun we havent stopped writing songs since we stopped recording pretty odd because we have a lot to write about
313425 its sounding pretty awesome which is probably what were going to call the next record
313426 weve got quite a few new ideas and songs weve been working on and were hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year
313427 i can tell you its on our latest record its in the middle somewhere
313428 we are always interested in any kind of workshop that is empowering and will encourage girls to feel like they can do anything
313429 they can create their own environment and be creative in the risks that they take
313430 if you can find other girls to play with its not just a bonding experience its not just about the music its sort of this big empowerment thing
313431 its a confidence builder youre playing and youre jelling together on a stage in front of people who are pumping you up and its just a really big empowerment and confidence booster
313432 we actually put a bunch of names in a little baggy and drew out four or five random words and put them together and we wrote down about 40 different possible names
313433 we were down to finding nowhere and broken media and we all voted for broken media
313434 total teenage drama its like us making fun of girls because we say they are talking on their cell phones listening to the radio looking in the mirror and trying to fix their hair
313435 we thought we should make it about people who would say lol
313436 we are on a steadily increasing trajectory yet somehow we have more schools not meeting ayp
313437 this speaks to the much needed changes to the nclb act
313438 in part this is because as our minority students perform better our caucasian students also continue to perform better
313439 in no way should parents look at these nclb numbers and place a label of failing on their childrens schools
313440 i think our internal data will show that we have made significant gains in reading and math its just not enough to keep up with what the nclb is requiring
313441 i also caution against state to state comparison of ayp results because states set their own proficiency cut scores and design their own tests
313442 i knew it was going to turn heads and that it was going to make a statement and we really appreciate that
313443 weve always been a band thats had things about us and things that are going on that creates big bold waves and whats so weird about the perception of the crusade is we wanted to show people that were not just a band thats going to stick to the same formula every time on that record we accomplished our main goal and that was to make it the exact opposite of 2005s ascendancy we didnt want to do anything that happened on that record on the next one but we still wanted to keep it us because we feel were a band that can broaden its sound and not just stick with one thing it was still metal and it was still trivium just different and diversified
313444 with this new record it basically summarizes everything we feel weve done right as a band that we feel are key ingredients of trivium all rolled into one with a new direction on top of it
313445 so it does have a little bit of everything weve done and some more it has as much singing on it as
313446 with the crusade we were done with screaming done with bands that did it done with doing it ourselves
313447 we just didnt want to do it anymore but when we started jamming for shogun and we heard how brutal and heavy some of the stuff was its the heaviest sh weve ever done before we tried singing over it and it wasnt right what was it missing the screaming and thats exactly what it needed
313448 we decided to take an old school approach to the record using new school technology purely for convenience because tape takes so f ing long to record with
313449 nick made us play this record the way metal is done these days you track it a couple of times make sure its perfect and then you go in and fix a couple of the pieces retrigger the guitars and drums thats just the way it is but we wanted to go back to the old school way record everything right with no triggers on our drums we had to make sure the performance was there and the energy was there and hearing the end result the stuff nick drew out of us is just unreal in terms of heaviness and brutality its the best thing weve done before wed never really considered ourselves a contender for even the word heavy or brutal but this time things are different
313450 just a big combination of everything wed loved as kids
313451 everyone weve played it for theyre all really excited about it
313452 i think weve found our sound weve just discovered it and with the next one i think well define it it takes a band a little while to find their sound some bands get it on the first record and some bands it takes several i think were one of those bands thats going to develop and fully come into our sound someday we dont know what record that will be but this record is even closer to what its going to be

313497 es dif cil estimar si el consumo de chocolate es realmente bajo o si apenas est estancado y creo que el caso es el segundo

313542 although the netherlands falls just outside the top ten the country has performed reasonably well with its 11th place the netherlands acquits itself extremely well relative to transport amp communications infrastructure and is a close second behind sweden in that area but the netherlands still has a lot of room for improvement in relation to market access and business environment i am thinking of for example fewer restrictions on foreign knowledge workers and a different attitude towards foreign capital

313608 as you may know nmah has been undergoing a renovation of the buildings infrastructure and interior for some time the renovation forced us to remove the information age exhibition the stations home since 1990 we placed the station in a temporary location for the duration of the renovation but it cannot remain there when we reopen to the public later this year the information age exhibit will not be reinstalled and since we have no other appropriate exhibition areas within the museum the station had to cease operations at nmah various alternate locations throughout the smithsonian have been considered but none are viable at this time

313610 our mission was to support the txmf and the soc with hf communications by expanding the normal net schedule and establishing a full time liaison
313611 in addition requests were sent to the other mars services in the region asking for liaison stations to participate in the army nets fortunately a hurricane exercise had been completed a week before and the exercise operations order was used to execute this mission we reacted to the storm the same way we trained for the emergency
313612 winlink is the perfect tool for this sort of thing
313613 you can send messages and get them when you have time the system works very well even without the internet and winlink is more secure and just easier for complicated messages
313614 even at that there were times when communications were out due to winds or flooding volunteers in mars and the amateur radio community provided what was needed to get through the storm and are standing by for any after effects
313615 our students found a treasure in commander william shepherd who took the time to talk to a group of junior high and elementary students in a small school in a small community he touched their lives and opened their eyes to a whole new world of opportunities and new career possibilities

313620 amateur radio gave me a greater sense that space exploration is a truly international endeavor and more than that its exciting internationally

313642 those things that do not kill you will only make you stronger
313643 we are still standing in new zealand first and are stronger than ever
313644 we heard today that the political dwarf in the yellow jacket has laid a complaint with the serious fraud office over so called allegations about new zealand first
313645 well as we were taught in school when it is better to stay silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt
313646 it is no coincidence that the colour the dwarf chooses to wear is yellow but his credibility is fading as fast as his hideous dress sense let me tell you why
313647 you see they have never let the facts get in the way of their salacious stories but we are here tonight to talk about far more serious matters
313648 while the media have been seduced by all manner of scandal and innuendo a real crisis has been unfolding one which effects every single household in new zealand as you are well aware 2008 is election year and nothing sharpens the mind like the prospect of a contest
313649 we are beginning to experience the unfettered impact of this so called globalization which we had foisted on us by unthinking ideologues since 1984
313650 that is not to say that new zealand should not be part of the global community we should
313651 but from 1984 onwards we tried to go further and faster in opening ourselves up than any other developed nation and we did not put the necessary safeguards in place to protect our own self interest
313652 those who promoted this economic and social experimentation were guilty of economic vandalism and we are dealing with the effects of that now
313653 we have the highest interest rates in the developed world and the most volatile dollar
313654 finance companies are falling like dominoes with tens of thousands of people losing their savings food and household prices are soaring and the list goes on
313655 every time we face a crisis those promoting these extreme neo liberal policies trot out the same tired mantra they call it the tina principle there is no alternative they wait until there is a crisis then inflict even more extreme right wing ideology on an unsuspecting population desperate for any solution that sounds reasonable
313656 well we are here tonight to say there is an alternative one which makes both economic sense and offers real hope for ordinary new zealanders and let me tell you why we need an alternative more than ever
313657 in the june monetary policy statement the reserve banks economic analysis on page 26 highlighted that 95 000 new zealanders have to lose their jobs over the next three years if we are to meet inflation targets through using interest rates you heard me right 95 000 jobs must go so the governor of the reserve bank can keep his job
313658 many of those 95 000 people have families to support which means the impact of this policy actually hits hundreds of thousands of new zealanders all because rigid ideology says there is no alternative this is the economic vandalism we spoke about earlier
313659 the sad thing is that we have been through this before and the results were the same then as they will be now
313660 in reality we think there is actually very widespread agreement among new zealanders on three fundamental points tax is important tax cuts are long overdue tax cuts must be responsible based on these fundamentals new zealand first has put forward a credible and straightforward package for tax cuts
313661 new zealand first wants to see a tax free threshold of 5 200 introduced
313662 they are all hugely excited about the prospect of becoming bloggers it might be difficult for them to all blog regularly because they dont all have easy internet access in their home countries but they will definitely be doing their best to post and will be blogging regularly during the conference
313663 a year from now if a junior developer on my team is using this api while im on vacation and im not there to answer questions will they be able to use it productively or are they going to get stuck because i didnt follow an established pattern principal naming convention
313664 sorry i just dont know what to do with him
313665 if you look at the past winners of this event it is a among dirt late model racing
313666 last year the twin 25s were excellent and the final 50 lap segment was amazing
313667 50 looking at a total minimum earnings potential of 1 000 for the night this should produce a lot of interest from both series drivers as well as the local regional cars and even some of the nationals stars
313668 we couldnt be more excited the geesey brothers macs series in our opinion is one of the finest organizations in the country as they bring their series back to our facility for the tenth time now we add the carolina clash and their talented group of drivers to the mix and it only escalates the potential for a tremendous event for the fans we are equally excited about the purse being offered it is now one of the top paying one day shows in the country
313669 the macs series is elated to continue its involvement at bill sawyers crown jewel of the south and the affiliation with ernie sheltons usa10 every effort has been made over the last several years to restore the luster to this time honored event with the addition of the carolina clash this should be a fans dream and a must see for 2008 the entire vms family is a gracious host not only to the drivers but the sanctioning bodies and fans as well
313670 we are very thrilled and honored to be involved with the usa 100 it is a race with a lot of tradition and to be competing at a world class venue like virginia motor speedway well i can assure you that everyone involved with the carolina clash from officials to drivers is excited to be a part of the usa 100
313671 excitement thats all i can say i didnt think that the race could get any better but last years race proved me wrong what an event bill and his entire staff do an outstanding job they have returned the excitement and prestige back to the usa 100 just as i felt they would do when we moved the event to vms in 2006 i have every confidence that success will be repeated again this year i feel vms is one of the finest state of the art facilities in the nation for showcasing this show bill sawyers ownership of the venue and his diligent staff including clarke is without any doubt second to none in the industry for surface preparation facility and fan amenities last years show had three and four wide racing all night long thanks to vms track preparation guru david law that is a delight for the fans as well as the drivers
313672 weve put together a good schedule with some very tough teams on it
313673 but i feel that as long as we play hard every game we have a chance to be competitive with everyone we play
313674 the bahamas trip should serve a couple of purposes for us
313675 being able to practice that early in the year will give our players a chance to come together as a unit on and off the court
313676 we are extremely pleased to partner with cbs collegiate sports properties
313677 their track record at other universities across the country makes them the right team to help us maximize the opportunities available for our new football program and our overall athletic department
313678 the growth of our athletic program over the past few years has been very exciting and the need for additional revenue made us look into ways to maximize our advertising opportunities
313679 our top priority was to secure a partner who not only would help us reach the departments goals but also understand and appreciate our university and community culture cbs collegiate sports properties fits that description
313680 it is an exciting time in the life of old dominion athletics and we at cbs collegiate sports properties are thrilled to be a part of it
313681 we look forward to tailoring the creative approach that has been successful at other properties to the needs of old dominion and to welcoming odu to our select family of collegiate partners

313696 i finally heard back from the maariv spokesman who denied that the obama campaign leaked the memo to them or gave them approval to print it and who disavowed the alleged spokesman who gave quotes to at least four israeli publications
313697 maariv says that it was the obama campaign that wanted to get the prayer to several jerusalem newspapers and wanted someone anyone everyone to print it
313698 i finally heard back from the maariv denied that the obama campaign leaked the memo to them or gave them approval to print it and who disavowed the alleged spokesman who gave quotes to at least four israeli publications
313699 told me definitively that the obama campaign did not give us a copy of the letter or approve it for printing
313700 additionally abc news senior national correspondent jake tapper reported in july 28 post on his blog political punch that a yeshiva student

313703 nobody thinks george w bush and john mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face
313704 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
313705 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
313706 he was describing that he was new to the political scene
313707 he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
313708 some of the problems include printing registered voters name sic instead of writing a female voter got married after she registered to vote and signed her maiden name registered voters signed the petitions but dont live in the 13th district
313709 why say youre for a new tomorrow then do old style chicago politics to remove legitimate candidates
313710 he talks about honor and democracy but what honor is there in getting rid of every other candidate so you can run scot free why not let the people decide
313711 i understand that president musharraf of pakistan has his own challenges but let me make this clear there are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3 000 americans they are plotting to strike again it was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al qaeda leadership meeting in 2005 if we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets and president musharraf wont act we will

313732 it is a great competition and a super event overall
313733 wrestling both rutgers and virginia tech in mid january will be a big test for our young squad
313734 it should be added that we have received a commitment from virginia tech to meet in the thunderdome in 2010
313735 with a ton of young wrestlers we wanted to get them as many matches as possible early in the schedule
313736 we plan on taking everyone that is ready to both of the first two tournaments prior to competing at the keystone classic
313737 its such an honor theyre all different but this is something ive dreamed of someday being able to win
313738 ive learned that i cant be in two places at once not that thats any excuse but honestly its the worst ive ever played
313739 i felt like i had two feet in two camps
313740 to see how those kids play and to see them totally immersed in the game that they love just absolutely inspired me and brought out the kid in me the kid that made me wish that i couldve done what theyre doing
313741 theres no looking back but they gave me a true shot in the arm i really owe it to those young players i just felt a resurgence of passion for playing and enjoying the game theyre not so caught up in results as they are just getting the ball into the hole they dont analyze everything
313742 when i can let the analytical go get in the moment and see the putt then im not nervous and im playing the game i didnt score myself on every thing
313743 i had a great week except for today but natalie played steady
313744 i shot under par all week and im thinking this is going to be my year but another person showed up today im happy for natalie ill be back

313767 click here and press f9 ill help you debug this broken thing
313768 since one page returns to the caller it might be worrying that the previous page will quickly flash up before navigating fortunately this is not the case as wpf waits for the return event handler to execute before loading or rendering the previous page if the return event handler from the calling page asks to navigate somewhere else wpf would perform the navigation without showing the page
313769 occurs when a called pagefunction returns and can only be handled by the calling page
313770 when using pagefunctions you need a reference to the object in order to subscribe to the event and for the handler to be invoked and so navigation with pagefunctions always involves the pagefunction object being left alive in memory similar to normal pages
313771 its actually quite concerning given that keepalive doesnt seem to affect regular pages depending on the navigation model but it does affect page functions
313772 its actually quite concerning given that keepalive doesnt seem to affect regular pages depending on the navigation model but it does affect page functions
313773 when you think about ways to visualize most data there are actually few places where an inline editable data grid with paging and sorting and grouping really make sense
313774 to paraphrase chuck jazdzewski if you are using data grids in wpf you are doing it wrong

313826 it isnt a moral question nobody is objecting to the consumption of alcohol as such but to the disastrous affects of drinking on the economic and social fabric of people the government may try as much as it wants but the fact is that banning arrack benefited the liquor lobby much more than it ever would ordinary citizens even this years proposal of opening new bars and wine shops and reducing the license fee is a step in that direction

313866 homeowners association fees werent an issue when units were originally purchased because most buyers were looking to flip the units he said when that didnt pan out the first thing some people did was stop paying homeowners association fees

313922 theres no easy solution when youre nine and nine wins and losses and we havent won a game in three weeks theres no easy solution
313923 we are constantly like every other side from probably fourth to 12th or 13th were all under pressure because very game is so important
313924 the top sides can generally hold their own but we are clearly one of the middle ranked sides and you fluctuate accordingly when you do that
313925 i would say yes we lack confidence and yes when you chase all day you do look slow
313926 thats the way it is but when you move the ball correctly or in a positive manner with confidence you dont look slow
313927 itll turn so long as the players believe thats why every week you go in with some confidence because you just know at some stage and you keep at it and keep at it the good people that are good players will turn it around at some stage
313928 and thats what you look for as a coach a support group the supporters thats what you demand and try to achieve

313932 i think its really cool because its a reward for all the hard work that youve done and also its the people who vote for it not the industry so i think its great
313933 i just hope that i dont drop down too much so as long as thats not the case ill be okay
313934 it sets us up for double life for the playoffs
313935 nobody got down everybody stayed positive and we did what we had to do to win
313936 a pair of wins on opening day is what we had hoped for
313937 we had contributions from all of our players and that will serve us well for the rest of the tournament
313938 es malo malo malo mostruo malo malo mami el windows malo malo malo
313939 its been a very good season for me so far ill work even harder in the second half to keep improving my skills
313940 in the races ill keep using my head so i can keep doing well i have been consistently fast and this is the area where i have fought the most to keep my performance level high with as few drop offs as possible my goal is to win and i would have liked to come out on top in more of the last lap battles weve had this year but it hasnt bothered me or gotten me down it just made me want to work even harder the race always goes the way it wants to go and as a rider you can only train more and get better
313941 my goal is to get in the top ten so i can go to indy
313942 at this race i really need to do my best and be consistent wanting to move up in points and earn your way into the riders cup it doesnt really change your strategy you cant worry about it and be too cautious or it will slow you down you have to run your race and just do your best for mid ohio i have been studying the maps but i really wont have the track down until we get to ride on it i have never been to the track but i hear it has a great atmosphere and that is always fun the circuit looks technical and i did well at barber earlier this year were racing about every other weekend for a while so i hope i can get some momentum
313943 ive gotten two sixths a fourth and a fifth and now i am looking for a podium
313944 it hasnt been too long since laguna so i think i can adapt a little quicker when we get to the track ive been riding supermoto and motocross at home trying to stay in top shape the guys that have been finishing in front of me between qualifying and the race their pace becomes a lot faster they really step it up i think the key is to get up with them on the start and learn few tricks my goal is the podium and once i get it i think it will help my confidence
313945 i always remember tim being an awesome guy with a wicked sense of humor i will never understand how a person could hurt someone like this my heart goes out to his family and loved ones rest in peace tim
313946 i cant see why this guy would even attack him
313947 he would never pick a fight he wouldnt intimidate the guy
313948 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
313949 obama will ensure that federal contracts over 25 000 are competitively bid obama will also increase the efficiency of government programs through better use of technology stronger management that demands accountability and by leveraging the governments high volume purchasing power to get lower prices
313950 if there is an economic slowdown no one bothered to tell the mobile device buying public
313951 in particular consumers in emerging markets in asia the middle east africa and south america shrugged off inflation fears to sign up as mobile phone users these healthy gains in net subscriber additions are stimulating replacement and upgrade sales in developed markets handset purchases tended to be flat but those consumers who did purchase dug deeper and paid out more for coveted higher end handsets and smart phones
313952 there is admittedly turmoil in the global economy but the mass markets fascination with getting the latest and greatest handset shows no sign of abating
313953 since the start of the year vendors have been wary of the potential decrease in demand for mobile phones
313954 that has not stopped vendors from experimenting with and releasing a host of mid range and high end devices with gps touchscreen and multimedia this also goes for hotly contested emerging markets where vendors are introducing phones that offer features in addition to voice telephony reception towards these devices has been warm and as we head into the holiday quarter demand for these and other devices will no doubt increase
313955 smartphones are still seeing growth rates hovering around 40 0 year over year while the rest of the industry is growing at roughly 10 0
313956 however grouping the rest of the handsets into one category is doing the industry no justice the rise of the feature phone has created a battle at the high end of the market with the main difference between smartphone and feature phone being the high level operating system we expect the competition at the high end will help drive growth within the market and help move volume to higher end devices
313957 obama will ensure that federal contracts over 25 000 are competitively bid obama will also increase the efficiency of government programs through better use of technology stronger management that demands accountability and by leveraging the governments high volume purchasing power to get lower prices
313958 this shows what can be done if the banking industry looks beyond just saying lets foreclose
313959 obama will ensure that federal contracts over 25 000 are competitively bid obama will also increase the efficiency of government programs through better use of technology stronger management that demands accountability and by leveraging the governments high volume purchasing power to get lower prices

314419 affirmed that iran as a state party to the npt nuclear non proliferation treaty has the right to have its fuel cycle program for peaceful purposes
314420 the ministers are of the view that sanctions imposed on iran for its nuclear program are of political nature and should be promptly removed
314421 they further affirm that with increased cooperation of iran with the agency to resolve all remaining issues about its past and present nuclear activities the issue of iranian nuclear program should be solely dealt with within the agency framework and there is no legal basis that the un security council proceeds in this regard
314422 the un security council has been clear on irans obligations the iaea has been clear that iran has not been transparent
314423 and now they cant even get their friends from the nam to come out in support of their interpretation of their program it actually reinforces just how isolated they are

314434 they say on the news they arrested people because of the bombing on gaza beach but they didnt even ask me about it they know i dont even know how to use a gun they just want to scare us
314435 we dont arrest people just to arrest people there are no political reasons
314436 i say clearly anyone who is found to have nothing to do with the bombing will be released

314438 he should have rollled up his sleeves and laid into the tories instead we got a lecture on oil prices and how difficult everything is
314439 he will get his retaliation in first with a massive relaunch and a massive this or that and everyone will wait and see if it works
314440 it would have been helpful to see some tentative feet being put forward by some non uber blairite wing to say there was some intelligence in the article
314441 he is poised on the edge of a cliff it will only take a small mistake for him to slip and plunge down in the end the public will decide they may just say they do not want brown and if that happens labour backbenchers will follow and if that happens miliband is now clearly there waiting to try and take his chance
314442 they had a good meeting they agreed that the war on terror was one that we needed to fight together because the enemy is going not just after pakistanis but the united states as well and so our joint efforts need to be comprehensive

314444 in some places the church is ridiculed as the gay church so membership is lost it is experienced as a new form of colonisation
314445 it is seen as leading to sexual license bishops cannot be a symbol for unity when their consecration divides the church in some regions the issue has become a basis for hostile actions
314446 had no idea their action had caused such a negative impact
314447 the revisionists push upon us the view that current secular culture and not the bible should shape our mission and morals
314448 everywhere we go we meet gay and lesbian activists receive their newsletters or read about their events they seem to be supported by north american churches they are determined that their way is the only right way

314479 so there has been nothing said and no grudges are held
314480 we are a really strong team and here for each other that was all done and dusted a long time ago

314500 being used figuratively the bible is clear that god is not a cosmic santa clause for the lord disciplines the one he loves and chastises every son whom he receives
314501 see an evil spirit from god is tormenting you 16 let our lord command his servants here to search for someone who can play the harp he will play when the evil spirit from god comes upon you and you will feel better

314513 last year yahoos board of directors and management took steps to thoroughly re examine the companys direction and to improve the companys performance
314514 since then yahoo has made significant strides in executing on its strategy performing particularly well in light of the challenging circumstances of the past six months
314515 at a unique point in our history where we have the eyes of the world focused on our company and tracking our performance we are redoubling our commitment to driving sustained profitable growth for our stockholders the value inherent in yahoos unique collection of assets is truly extraordinary
314516 tom lantos the late congressman from silicon valley said in session that yahoos leadership are the equivalent of moral pygmies i would agree to that although that would be denigrating to the pygmies
314517 you have 22 board meetings other than yahoos to attend each year
314518 we would prefer that you spend less time doing other companies business and focus more on the job at hand here
314519 probably the hardest worker at yahoo and one of the smartest people we know shes tireless we get 3 a m emails from her shes very capable and capable people can do more than others
314520 her connections with other companies like intel and costco are very important for our company her work on those boards does not affect her work as president at all
314521 the company is too bloated right now they need to reduce head count and divest some of their holdings that arent making any money
314522 the board has people that have been on too long when youve been on for 10 years or more you cant be objective anymore
314523 yes it would have been a great deal for the shareholders and for the company
314524 we should have taken the deal but i dont think its completely dead i believe microsoft will come back around next year and try again

314534 i was surprisingly calm i was more calm than before my first high school start
314535 a guy like craig because he worked so hard to master the things he needed to do that gave him the confidence for his innate qualities to express themselves
314536 one of his strengths was his toughness and his belief in himself
314537 i think some guys have a certain calmness and certain confidence about them
314538 i think in some cases they come to school that way we saw the same things out of vince when he was at houston madison high school we saw him make play after play after play
314539 there is a certain confidence and poise and intelligence level that makes those guys successful
314540 vince was in a class by himself because he had so many tools our players were drawn to him early and he had a certain magnetism about him
314541 i think its just something a kid has and the more experiences he has doing it and the more successes he has doing it he just gets that much more comfortable and confident brett favre was like that montana was like that they wanted the ball in their hands in situations like that i think a kid either has it or he doesnt
314542 you put them in every situation in practice over and over again you drill it and you drill it you never put a kid in a situation in a game that he hasnt seen before we coach quarterbacks like we coach left tackles its not always easy i try to put a lot of pressure on them
314543 if hes got that makeup and youve prepared him the best you can prepare him then hes going to have a chance to show that he is a clutch guy
314544 guys like heath have faced pressure before and have been successful so they expect success
314545 he was a very intense player but he had a calmness about him it was pretty easy to see that he had that quality very early whatever it is hes got it
314546 he asked that his privacy and that of his family is respected while he gets well

314554 the difficult news this morning is that we thought we were getting a patch but we havent gotten anything
314555 essentially were at the same place as we were yesterday before apple released the patch
314556 so apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the work around for the protocol weakness
314557 this update addresses the issue by implementing source port randomization to improve resilience against cache poisoning attacks

314562 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does
314563 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day
314564 to me him not being here is the difference between 39th and 38th
314565 im not a great putter but im not a bad putter
314566 the british open was the turning point where i played really well and putted really badly and decided thats it im not a good putter with a short putter ive decided that im going to putt with the belly if you see me with a short one that means that something is wrong with me
314567 when i hit the ball it just didnt go straight today
314568 and i also had been hitting a lot of good putts and i made a bunch today i made some good ones to see balls rolling in now im starting to gain a little bit more confidence a little bit more momentum
314569 i remember when i won the masters in 06 i had a great week the week before

314576 everyone was partying and everyone was pretty the dancefloor was crowded the bathrooms were worse we kissed in your car and we drank from your purse
314577 were tipping over in the taprooms were shooting through the ceiling were dying in the bathrooms
314578 its one thing to start out with a positive jam and its another thing to see it on through
314579 we gotta try a little harder we gotta be a little better we gotta pull it back together
314580 i am probably going to start wearing tie dye shirts
314581 we like to shit with the door open talk about pussy and go on riverboat gambling trips

314584 a force as powerful as all the trains in manitoba
314585 i am probably going to start wearing tie dye shirts
314586 its just the combination of a very short delay where it sounds kind of metallic and then playing high on the neck
314587 we always get the whole tropical thing i think were coming from a more punk rock end of things
314588 when i think of guitar i think of the sound more than the playing
314589 good playing has a lot of passion greg ginn is probably one of the most inspirational guitarists if youve seen video of him playing its as though the guitar is his enemy and hes doing battle with it
314590 we have yet to pull over to the side of the road and use a pay phone to confirm a show
314591 i think to that degree technology is definitely on our side
314592 were friends with the guys in pissed jeans and one of the ideas dean sprunt no age drummer had was to do a zine where we all interview each other
314593 but its still in the works our intentions were just to do a xerox zine but i think were dealing with a non xerox world
314594 i am probably going to start wearing tie dye shirts
314595 i like young women my emphasis i think most men do
314596 do you think theres something more to my life than my relations with young women
314597 i am probably going to start wearing tie dye shirts
314598 im over they heads like a bulimic on a see saw
314599 i am probably going to start wearing tie dye shirts
314600 and i could not help but think through the stink that i was just a puppet in a play
314601 i dont find the song to be about this boy at all its really more of a greek drama isnt it its about mothers
314602 the different kinds of mothers biological honorary all the mothers wrapped into one
314603 i am probably going to start wearing tie dye shirts
314604 theres trouble down here theres trouble down there theres trouble everywhere
314605 i am probably going to start wearing tie dye shirts
314606 youll have to put that question to him ive got no idea he loves the job hes in its part of the territory you dont enter this industry without anticipating this stuff you go in with your eyes wide open
314607 if youve got any questions about the wallabies ill be keen
314608 once again i dont really give it too much thought to be honest the players have been playing with them from the start if they hadnt been exposed to them that would probably be more of an issue
314609 these guys are probably in better shape now for this challenge than they were in week one south africa in perth or week two
314610 there was never a compelling offer put on the table
314611 i am probably going to start wearing tie dye shirts

314614 as she has throughout the trial judge miller in the end ignored case law precedent and a judges prior rulings on this very lawsuit not to mention the law of the land
314615 incredibly we were found liable under judge millers direction for keeping sf weekly alive during the very difficult years after the dot com bust and 9 11 our multi million dollar investment to cover losses in the san francisco paper in this difficult economic environment was cited by the judge and bay guardian to the jury as de facto proof of our intent to injure the bay guardian
314616 millers naivet regarding competitive markets in times of economic turbulence is breathtaking
314617 she should not be trying cases involving competitive or economic issues mom and pop advertisers in san francisco will suffer from her handiwork as will any aggressive new business in the city that attempts to challenge a larger established competitor
314618 as brugmanns lawyer pointed out to the judge and jury repeatedly and on the record all sf weekly had to do to avoid this litigation was to raise advertising rates to match the guardian s rate card this is a plain invitation to price fixing and sf weekly consistently declined the guardian offer
314619 and so we were found guilty of selling below cost with an intent to injure them
314620 raised its prices to the same level as the guardian and let the customer decide
314621 if you believe your product is better why not charge the same price and let the customer decide
314622 i am probably going to start wearing tie dye shirts
314623 yeah when i first started i felt sorry for people too
314624 i am probably going to start wearing tie dye shirts
314625 i was a little concerned but they said can you please try it at this length and i said okay like every dancer does you try to be very accommodating
314626 i must have said im sorry about a thousand times
314627 ive seen someone fall twist her ankle and roll off the stage like a tumbleweed
314628 i knew one dancer who fractured his tibia on stage and it sounded like a rifle shot
314629 i had one friend who for three years took two aspirin right before he went on stage in the end he had an ulcer burst in a performance he was losing blood while performing a very difficult 25 minute pas de deux
314630 the people who get the farthest in this company are the ones whove hidden more injuries and pushed themselves more than anyone else
314631 i am probably going to start wearing tie dye shirts
314632 while the designation and name of the park will change
314633 the administrative policies will not be affected nor will access for recreational users of the space be limited
314634 will assure that public investments in the park will benefit the public not an outside interest that could purchase the presidio from the general services administration should the trust not achieve self sufficiency
314635 we are on schedule to meet our goal in 2013 when the presidio will no longer be dependent on federal funds and will meet its full operating cost
314636 provide for the administration of certain presidio properties at minimal cost to the federal taxpayer
314637 self sufficiency had earned the needed political support but it meant the presidio could be sold
314638 park advocates celebrated the legislation but we also knew that the presidios salvation came with an unusual and heavy obligation
314639 any real property so transferred shall be deleted from the boundary of the golden gate national recreation area
314640 i am probably going to start wearing tie dye shirts
314641 you think the marina is lame yet admonish the rest of us not to be so judgmental about the marina holier than thou
314642 i am probably going to start wearing tie dye shirts
314643 im getting spanked in second life but id rather be sleeping
314644 sorry about all those calls i probably sound like an asshole
314645 i am probably going to start wearing tie dye shirts
314646 but ive never supported any of the aliotos for office i even supported matt gonzalez against angela
314647 i am also the strongest district 3 candidate to advance our values and stand up to special interest groups who are planning to spend millions to defeat the causes we care about the most
314648 i was endorsed by groups such as the harvey milk club san francisco labor council san francisco tenants union san francisco womens political committee san francisco acorn san francisco bay guardian the sierra club san francisco young democrats and san francisco league of conservation voters
314649 when you dig just beneath the surface of browns slander you see there is no evidence at all
314650 vision that new online technologies could radically empower individuals from all backgrounds to organize vibrant grassroots constituencies
314651 despite the bipartisan nature of our company the overwhelming majority of our political clients serve progressive and democratic interests
314652 these political attacks attempt to impugn my record by selectively highlighting the pre grassroots employment biographies of two individuals affiliated with grassroots washington dc office these two individuals had previously worked with the christian coalition and the national rifle association two organizations with which i have always vehemently disagreed
314653 since the majority of grassroots employees are politically left the board of directors of grassroots enterprise brought on these two individuals to add political diversity to grassroots washington dc office the companys headquarters this is the common practice of companies in washington dc and throughout the country
314654 contrary to h browns wild accusations grassroots has never licensed its technology to the christian coalition alliance defense fund the national rifle association or any comparable anti gay christian conservative or pro gun organizations
314655 my own professional work while at grassroots has only been with democratic and progressive clients
314656 given the facts i hope you will judge my long standing track record accurately and compare it with other candidates in the district 3 race
314657 based on my actual record assemblyman mark leno supervisor aaron peskin supervisor tom ammiano supervisor chris daly supervisor ross mirkarimi district attorney kamala harris public defender jeff adachi school board members eric mar and jane kim and many other citywide and district 3 leaders have endorsed me for district 3 supervisor
314658 would not have caused significant injury to the national interest
314659 it could have complicated diplomatic relations with certain states through references to the positions of those countries regarding particular issues expected to be raised at the summit
314660 systematic failure of the government regime for protecting classified information
314661 it has to be acknowledged that the incident itself was injurious to the national interest by tarnishing canadas good reputation within nato circles for safeguarding classified information
314662 no empirical evidence was obtained including witnesses interviewed coming forward to refute mr berniers version of events
314663 what they are seemingly trying to do here is to put the blame almost entirely on madame couillard

314665 corporate and government responses to climate change arent going to save us
314666 and communities have to work together to come up with solutions that work for us
314667 but the same skills the tree climbing the line and rope skills can also be used in things like banner hangs office occupations
314668 what we hope to accomplish is to educate people on to how they can do these direct actions and civil disobediences with the hope that theyre going to go out and organize it on their own
314669 well be targeting anybody that we see involved in any kind of climate change issue
314670 that could be from forest destruction to dirty energy projects to the dams

314681 youre always looking for a boost in trades and all those things

314708 made me giggle bravo mr panos also the introduction of a show within a show while often a tired conceit worked well here if only to clarify that the excesses of mr roiland are indeed excesses finally the uncomfortable expressions on the store clerk and the show producers faces at the end was deliciously disturbing planners

314722 i ended up kicking eight which is pleasing but with some set shots i have got to do a little bit of work on that again during the week
314723 to be honest i havent really thought about kicking 100 goals at all
314724 im playing every game on its merits and just want to keep playing consistent football if that comes it comes
314725 im not going to be surprised one day if franklin breaks that record for the number of goals kicked in one game
314726 if its not him its roughead they kicked 12 goals between them tonight

314728 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
314729 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 us dollars of immediate relief
314730 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
314731 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
314732 excuse me young man this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later
314733 why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community or black community in this country
314734 i think youre misinformed when you say not one time
314735 every issue that youve spoken about i actually did speak out of
314736 what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
314737 id like a few moments with the unknown soldier please
314738 been made aware of the alleged discovery of contraband within portlaoise prison
314739 repeated government promises to rid our prisons of drugs and mobile phones are worthless
314740 run their criminal empires from behind bars are totally unacceptable in any democratic state
314741 even with the introduction of these new security measures there is still a risk that contraband can be smuggled into a prison
314742 that is not under consideration tysabri offers ms patients a new level of efficacy
314743 as we have said in the past as the fda has stated and as is clearly described in our fda approved labelling and risk management plan we anticipate seeing cases of pml the benefit risk profile of tysabri remains favourable
314744 it is premature to speculate about future actions we still expect tysabri will ultimately be the leading therapy for ms it remains our goal to achieve 100 000 patients on therapy by the end of 2010
314745 clarity on both alzheimers therapy bapineuzumab and tysabri will take time but we believe that the share price is factoring in an overly pessimistic scenario for both
314746 the challenge with investing in this stock is that it is now a potential time bomb
314747 i sincerely regret that our share price over the last 12 months has fallen significantly from its previous high but as one of ryanairs largest shareholders i am determined to grow your company and remain confident that our earnings and share price will rebound strongly when the irrational exuberance which currently affects the oil market settles down as it inevitably will
314748 he didnt have any more money to spend on legal fees he was much more emotionally labile in terms of sensitivity to things than most scientists he was very thin skinned
314749 ill tell you we made great progress in the investigation mr mueller added
314750 i was questioned by the feds and i sung like a canary
314751 in two of the six incidents the girls were sexually assaulted whilst in a third the teenager was indecently assaulted
314752 extensive patrols were conducted of the area however the man was not located
314753 i keep thinking its just a horror movie and we saw it and were going to wake up and were going to get out of the movie theatre and tim is going to be home and were all going to go out
314754 i cant see why this guy would even attack him
314755 he would never pick a fight he wouldnt intimidate the guy
314756 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
314757 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
314758 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
314759 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
314760 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
314761 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
314762 this micro organism is potentially a risk to a small minority of patients in view of this the hospital has as a precautionary measure taken the decision to restrict admission to the unit temporarily
314763 this has implications for the hospital in the management of critically ill and high risk patients all patients who may require critical care services will be transferred to other intensive care units in the region
314764 while we appreciate this may have a significant impact on our patients our primary concern is their safety and welfare in view of this all elective admissions will be monitored by our consultant surgeons and consultant anaesthetists on a daily basis for a short period we may have to defer some procedures
314765 the dispersions of the public bodies around the country and the extent of movement of staff introduces an exposure to theft and loss of equipment
314766 the office acknowledges the need to manage any risk to the disclosure of client data and it very much regrets the loss of the equipment and any consequential risk that data while held on password protected equipment could be improperly disclosed
314767 there is no evidence that the offices systems were specifically targeted and in all cases the thefts appeared to have been opportunistic in nature
314768 the office therefore considers the risk of injury or loss to data subjects is limited taking account of the passage of time
314769 we cannot comment on this loss until the investigation takes place
314770 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
314771 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
314772 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
314773 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
314774 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder

314785 can you believe that in 2 days we will be in india
314786 i can point the way for you but you must walk the path yourself
314787 our hearts are like a mirror that reflects what is pictured in the tablet of fate but even in sleep thoughts of worldly things dull this mirror so that the impressions it receives are not clear after death however such thoughts vanish and things are seen in their naked reality dear friend your heart is a polished mirror you must wipe it clean of the veil of dust that has gathered upon it because it is destined to reflect the light of divine secrets
314788 i reckon so if not itll do til the mess gets here

314792 give your husband time to find himself i also know he signed himself in because you threatened to sign him in
314793 i need to get my children away from this state
314794 i would have preferred to wait until the kids were through college before leaving him
314795 i still remember the night he came into the office and called the police because he just knew something was wrong with the car
314796 he may find his way back to himself but i cant risk the welfare of my children on a risk
314797 i understand he did come after you and your sister
314798 has your father ever talked to you about your grandmother
314799 youre grandmother was a well known profiler for law enforcement her abilities went into the extraordinary
314800 my brother in the cloth believes youre more than you appear as well
314801 your great grandmother was part of an investigation of the miracle branch
314802 your great grandmother said the same thing when she refused to board the titanic
314803 your great grandmother refused to board the ship because she said it was doomed
314804 youre fathers mom could see snippets of the future as well
314805 its just the power of belief which makes things happen not some strange power to see the future
314806 the reason why the miracle branch investigated your great grandmother is because she tried to stop the titanic from sailing
314807 your mom keeps her feet firmly on the ground doesnt she
314808 dad never talks about his mother or his grandmother much
314809 the miracle branch was called in by the local authorities after your grandmother found a missing child lost in a snowstorm by all accounts she knew where the unconscious boy was
314810 maybe she just knew where he would be because she knew him
314811 i had tried to climb a tree and hit my head on the way down
314812 thats ludicrous jake people wont care that much and even if they did a merger could just as easily happen
314813 it will depend largely on what happens maybe over the next week and in this first ballgame
314814 we need to see some of these outside linebackers play outside linebacker and we also need to see some of these outside linebackers play with their hand in the ground a little bit and play defensive end its a little bit easier thinking about them playing defensive end because thats their nature some of these guys were picking their hand up and playing them at outside linebacker spots and we need to see them play up on their feet in game situations
314815 hand placement is something ive improved on since rookie camp but thats something i still need to work on
314816 i also need to work on playing a little lower at times ill play high i learn a lot of things from the veterans i sit in meetings with those guys everyday and they just give you little pointers here and there and tell you whats going on how to beat certain types of linemen
314817 ive been really impressed with kendall the first week of practice i think hes done some good things
314818 he probably has made the greatest gains in the offseason program when the rookies were here by themselves whatever that was five weeks he made tremendous gains in the weight room strength wise and really his conditioning all those things
314819 and i see it out here from the spring until now when we watched him early on maybe it wasnt as strong it wasnt as stout at the point of attack now im watching the guy play with his hands play stronger at the point of attack now hes got a lot of things to work on and seeing some of these reads for the first time but ive been impressed with him
314820 honestly the biggest surprise is soliai hes beating the heck out of people
314821 he started out slow last year but he came out for this camp i think he lost 30 pounds since last season so hes moving pretty well and hes doing a great job so soliai langford merling merling has a lot of explosion a lot of those young guys are going to contribute to the team this year
314822 we really just wanted to focus on spending maybe 15 minutes in each phase of the game breaking it down fundamentally trying to see maybe who our best punt blockers may be and cover guys might be that was really a good practice for us as practices go when youre out here you get a lot out of a bunch of practices but we got an awful lot out of what went on out there today
314823 something i had until then thought of as impossible seeing as attractors mesmerized me beyond my ability to comprehend by virtue of its simplicity when first i came upon it and had me spending countless hours marvelling at this tribute to newtonian kinematics
314824 we are working to validate that the chief is anti gay

314827 i dont want to believe youve abandoned the republican party but
314828 so i am surprised and concerned especially because i know how generously you supported president bush and the rnc in the past
314829 the democrats are determined to put a liberal like barack obama in the white house expand their narrow majorities in the u s house and senate and push our country to the left with their agenda of high taxes big government and weakened national security

314832 to be uninterested in economy is to be uninterested in the practice of religion it is to be uninterested in culture and in character
314833 unmentioned in national reporting was the fact that obama was preceded by a rare 45 minute
314834 free concert by popular band preceded obamas big rally at http www newsbusters org blogs robert knight 2008 05 20 free concert popular band preceded obama s big rally
314835 while we appreciate the obama campaigns hospitality on behalf of furthering us international relations offering free bratwurst pizza and even beer for three hours during the free rock concert we question whether or not the monies might have been better spent here on financially strapped us citizens

314852 i am sure thats part of the process the growing pains a little bit right now for ronnie as he is going through this whole thing and for us
314853 but we are watching him closely trying to guard his reps making sure that he gets the specific things he needs we got him involved in the blocking drill yesterday in the morning these are some of the things that he needs to have and certainly he needs to have now early in training camp he is doing really well and i am really pleased with the amount of work that we are able to get out of him
314854 i think everybody knows that you have to take advantage of every one of your reps you might not get a lot of reps but when you get the reps you want to take full advantage and prove that you know what youre doing out there
314855 its just a matter of knowing you know the play and going out and performing and executing the play well you know when you mess up and you know when youre making right plays youve just got to keep improving and keep learning
314856 i think he runs with speed a little upright sometimes were trying to get him to bend down a little bit more but i like what he does i see a little bit of burst out of him and hes got pretty good vision
314857 theyre getting on us and if they ask you to bring their pads in youre kind of obligated to but im getting used to it
314858 this has been it so far sometimes we just get them drinks like water or gatorade to the meeting rooms and thats been it so far but im expecting it to get a little worst
314859 i dont know about conflicts but i think early on in the preseason itll be interesting to see how the whole process goes
314860 it doesnt really mean that youre not going to continue your defensive signals you have to have them ready if something happens during the course of the game and one of these systems goes down there is the backup plan with the secondary guy that can where the other helmet
314861 but at the same time with the transition and the time it takes youve still got to hand signal and do all these things well look at it in preseason and see where we go from the thing you treat at as a luxury and to be honest with you i was on the other side of the ball and youre talking to the quarterback constantly so id always think why dont they talk to the defense whats the big secret but it gives us a chance and well take a look at it
314862 you dont want to be giving away throws and in the past those things from a statistical standpoint have worked a little bit more offensively than they did defensively so i think you have to think about it but its not much one way or another the bottom line is to get your feet inbounds
314863 what well do is well compete against other and well try to get our goods on our goods as much as we can right now
314864 when i say goods on goods i mean youll work your first units and then your second units together then you might even cross over and maybe see the second units versus the first units to see how somebody responds to a little bit maybe better competition but were going to hit all situations more importantly just get them out there and just let them play get people off the field and start getting this coach the quarterbacks and create a game environment
314865 i think familiarity with the offense and maybe our familiarity with him is why carter was brought in
314866 but again this is just a workout thats all it is its a look see to see whats happening out there jeff ireland and bill parcells will do their due diligence on every player thats out there and every player thats available one way or another to try to help our football team
314867 the global sales value of bd movie discs as a percentage of all types will increase from 9 at the end of 2007 to 20 in mid 2008 and further to 25 at the end of this year

314875 live life fully while youre here experience everything take care of yourself and your friends have fun be crazy be weird go out and screw up youre going to anyway so you might as well enjoy the process take the opportunity to learn from your mistakes find the cause of your problem and eliminate it dont try to be perfect just be an excellent example of being human

314879 beauty let me tell you something being thought of as a beautiful woman has spared me nothing in life no heartache no trouble love has been difficult beauty is essentially meaning less and it is always transitory
314880 i see eyes that are too small and hair that is stringy i see a body that needs to exercise and a face that could use a face lift
314881 its painful just to listen to you all youve given me is a list of harsh judgments
314882 but that is what i see when i look in the mirror i am usually so disgusted by my body that i avoid looking at myself
314883 you are telling me what you see through veils and veils of un worthiness everything you see is colored by your judgment of what you think you should be seeing what an ideal body would look like
314884 but this time look with the eyes in the center of your chest tell me about this body and its particular beauty
314885 they have gold flecks in them and a pretty shape they have watched my children grow up and theyve seen the turquoise of the ca ribbean theyve been good to me
314886 now tell me more about your eyes look at your self the way you would look at a work of art and tell me what you see
314887 i can see oh wow its like i can see behind my eyes to something thats hard to put into words some thing big i can see wisdom there in my eyes i can actually see the child i once was i can see joy i can see beauty and possibilities
314888 its amazing isnt it that the minute we start seeing beauty in our own faces beauty in our very alive ness we think we are being hypno tized we are so used to judging ourselves that when we stop feeling unworthy we think someone must be playing a trick on us

314931 the u s invasion of afghanistan was as illegal as the invasion of iraq
314932 the invasion of afghanistan was not legitimate self defense under the un charter because the attacks on september 11 were criminal attacks not armed attacks by another country afghanistan did not attack the united states
314933 regrouped after its fall from power and have coalesced into a resilient insurgency
314934 it now poses a challenge to the afghan governments authority in some rural areas the taliban is likely to maintain or even increase the scope and pace of its terrorist attacks and bombings in 2008
314935 a plurality of americans believe the war in afghanistan is more important than the one in iraq by a 44 percent to 38 percent margin

314938 the afghanistan war man did i dig that id like to go again
314939 the conflict in afghanistan will be far more costly and much much longer than americans realize this war already in its seventh year will eventually become the longest in american history surpassing even vietnam
314940 as a forward operating site bagram must be able to provide for a long term steady state presence which is able to surge to meet theater contingency requirements
314941 the prospects for peace in afghanistan are being undermined because western countries are failing to deliver on their promises of aid to the tune of 10 billion and because aid going to the country is used ineffectively

314949 i think that the decision today is the end of guantanamo as we know it
314950 for the first time in history it does inject judicial supervision into the conduct of war

314964 i met him twice and we talked like two ordinary people not as owner and coach he said do better for chelsea thats it nothing more
314965 i speak to people in the game a lot and they tell me about ajax who in the 1970s won the with an extremely young team and changed the face of the game
314966 people tell me that we are on course to do that but we need that stepping stone of winning something of knowing how to win
314967 before the euros i didnt know how it felt to win but now that i have experienced it i know what it takes you need to have tasted it
314968 look at chelsea they hadnt won anything in many years they got experienced players in won the league and that gave them experience and confidence together and others followed
314969 sometimes that is the key everyone said before last season that we werent even going to finish amongst the top four and we proved them wrong
314970 it would be beautiful he can play as centre forward or in the same role as raul just behind the forwards and also in the two positions in midfield
314971 ill use two different line ups for the two games so that we can keep running for the 90 minutes

315001 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
315002 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him

315028 all the regular stuff such as having to tie ribbons on hundreds of wedding invitations or learn an intricate dance routine for the first dance
315029 one woman who was asked to be a bridesmaid in her mormon friends wedding found out on the morning of the wedding that she wasnt actually going to be allowed inside the temple because she wasnt mormon
315030 her job as a bridesmaid was to stand on the front steps of the temple in her full bridesmaids outfit and ask those who showed up are you a believer in the church of latter day saints she had to make sure that non mormons including the brides father who had been excommunicated did not get inside
315031 you dont know whos crazier the people who ask or the people who actually go along with it
315032 i want you to be in my wedding but first youll have to get new boobs
315033 we all know women whove gone crazy about their wedding day i think its easy to criticize individual brides for excess and certainly they commit excess but we live in a bridezilla culture where the whole wedding system is set up to make a bride think its her right and her privilege and probably even her duty to have this day which is all about her and if its all about you then theres no limit to what you can expect of your supporters and attendants and the great circus of people around you
315034 was not going to be one of those brides that the bridesmaids could wear whatever we wanted that there would be none of that jessica mcclintock bullshit

315045 these events dramatize the lack of social responsibility among todays youth
315046 during saddams time we were not allowed to conduct such festivals
315047 the only festivals were religious since the liberation of iraq the security situation was not safe enough to conduct any festivals the 4th bct soldiers have made our area safe and this is the reason we were able to hold this festival
315048 as we walked around we were able to meet some of the artists
315049 they were all very willing and proud to show off their work
315050 it was an honor to be invited to attend the play and the people were able to see the strong bond between coalition forces and the people of seddah
315051 we feel this shows how far seddah has come in the last nine months and how self sufficient the city council has become in seddah
315052 you see it was the only workers i could get
315053 okay maybe you and i are just used to dealing with these kinds of situations in different ways lets say you are me this is how you feel followed by description with pea as the main character instead of me what would you do if this were you
315054 fine whatever why are we wasting time talking about this
315055 violence is down to its lowest level since the spring of 2004
315056 there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
315057 because of these operations extremists who once terrorized the citizens of these communities have been driven from their strongholds
315058 was able to walk the streets of sadr city last wednesday
315059 this operation is iraqi led our forces are playing a supporting role
315060 the iraqis will continue taking the lead in more military operations across the country
315061 beginning tomorrow troops deploying to iraq will serve 12 month tours instead of 15 month tours
315062 this will ease the burden on our forces it will make life easier for our wonderful military families
315063 al qaida is on the run in iraq but the terrorists remain dangerous and they are determined to strike our country and our allies again
315064 in this time of war america is grateful to all the men and women who have stepped up forward to defend us
315065 understand that we have no greater responsibility than to stop the terrorists before they launch another attack on our homeland
315066 and every day they make great sacrifices to keep the american people safe here at home we owe our thanks to all those who wear the uniform and their families who support them in their vital work and the best way to honor them is to support their mission and to bring them home with victory
315067 i personally believe that there is a real possibility of some additional drawdowns as we look forward
315068 some level of durability i think is one that fits
315069 but its still not irreversible we havent gotten to that point
315070 then we clearly are looking at afghanistan where results are mixed
315071 the challenges are certainly significant and wed like to get additional troops there as soon as we could
315072 im very comfortable that it gets us where we need to go from the military perspective for the requirements that we have
315073 its been spirited and i think a very healthy negotiation which in fact is still ongoing despite some reports that its imminent and i think we have to wait until those negotiations finish to really know obviously what the outcome is with respect to the details

315091 the boys are going to fix the garage roof this week and we wont spend more than seventy dollars
315092 i think we could probably save twenty bucks if robbie would go get us a few packs of shingles from that place he used to work
315093 he might have to work a little for them but it would mean some extra food in the fridge for him afterward
315094 i think you three should get up that damn ladder and fix the roof yourselves
315095 robbie wasnt here when we sat down called roll and started the meeting
315096 when i was already buck naked and in the shower with him
315097 i reached up to wash his to wash jills hair and then
315098 would you mind sending him back in there with me he missed a spot when he soaped my back
315099 its your day do whatever you want dont let anyone else tell you what to do

315106 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
315107 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 dollars of immediate relief
315108 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
315109 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
315110 excuse me young man this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later
315111 why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community or black community in this country
315112 i think youre misinformed when you say not one time
315113 every issue that youve spoken about i actually did speak out of
315114 what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates

315120 falls short of the promise made by the host and the international olympic committee of complete freedom for the media
315121 it continues to be unacceptable that the chinese government can decide according to its mood which websites are censored and which are accessible
315122 i dont think that politicizing the olympic games will do anything good to addressing any of the issues
315123 it goes against the shared aspirations of people from around the world
315124 interdepartmental jealousies in canada appear to have led to the cancellation of this program
315125 there is a very strong anti military bias that says lets get rid of these guys because they are a bunch of military people doing things that the military shouldnt do

315137 anwar has betrayed himself and the very people who support him he was a strong advocate of the new economic policy now he wants to abolish it granted there are corrupt politicians but why should we abolish the nep which is the basis of our constitutional rights
315138 anwar also tried to dilute islam whereas he proclaimed himself to be a champion of the religion why because he wanted to have the non malay support and well he got it in the last general election
315139 even if umno doesnt want me as the candidate for permatang pauh im willing to be at the constituency day and night to campaign for bn as well as to strip anwar of his populist claims
315140 if i contest im going to be the underdog i know its difficult to unseat anwar in his former constituency but its not about winning or losing its having the opportunity to face anwar and to tell the voters that they have been duped by the very man they revered
315141 if you notice anwar doesnt talk much about saiful actually its just a case between him and saiful who claimed that anwar had victimised him but anwar would rather tell his supporters that it is a battle between him and the government he must always be seen as a great man
315142 anwar has gone overboard he crossed the line and lost the statesmanship anwar lost all these in his pursuit for power
315143 people are not stupid even pas leaders have realised that i know there are a lot of resentment against anwar and pkr especially in selangor where the party is governing
315144 i know some people have accused pak lah of being politically weak but i see a strong resolve in that man he is serious about fighting corruption i might be wrong about the pm but at least he gives me the space to do something right for the country
315145 i will do it thats my commitment to umno if we dont clean up the party from bad elements how are going to reform society
315146 if you ask me what kind of image i want
315147 all the time he tried to poison my mind on anwars character he claimed to know anwar inside out
315148 i joined umno because of anwar ibrahim and left umno because of anwar ibrahim
315149 invite our friends from across the floor to cross over and take over putrajaya
315150 since merdeka in 1957 until now this is the lowest point in our politics our image is the worst it has ever been the economy has no direction the world is laughing at us newspapers from indonesia thailand london america and the arab world are all publishing news of how bad things have become here
315151 they do this to me because i dare to stand up for the people and expose corruption in the government because i am seen as a challenger to them they say if you dare to challenge us these are the methods we will use because i am anwar ibrahim up to now i have not seen the police report accusing me of sodomy why because they have the report number but it has no contents so they can change it according to whatever statements i make
315152 they are saying he is not a specialist that he is not a sodomy doctor now the newspapers in england are writing that the worlds only sodomy doctor can be found in malaysia where is there such a thing as a sodomy or backside doctor
315153 have i not been dishonoured enough how about how azizah and my children feel if you have proof i will fight it now they dont have anything no witnesses and instead they detain the doctor for three days according to their whim and fancy
315154 why then was i made to fill up a rape victims report at the hospital
315155 next month when i want to contest the by election they might charge me with something else when we are going to putrajaya another

315219 to anybody who knew him he was that bright bubbly happy guy he was always out for fun i already miss him
315220 second degree murder carries a range of parole ineligibility of between 10 and 25 years for first degree murder its a minimum 25 years
315221 so the actual sentence might not be very different from what it would be for first degree
315222 ive been doing this for 21 years and i can judge the type of people were hiring
315223 he was just a normal guy or so we thought to read about this it just totally gives me shivers ive had shivers just the past couple of hours
315224 the name of the accused as it is quoted is not found in our current serving records nor does it appear or show up in our past serving cf member records
315225 i was like i hope to god theres another tim mclean
315226 he was a sweetheart he was tiny we all called him tiny tim he picked on me because i was smaller than him but it was all in good fun hed never even hurt a fly he wouldnt even kill an ant if it was crawling up his leg
315227 he was that guy who all the girls said he was their best friend and it was true because he was such a sweetheart you couldnt think of him as anything but a friend i cant think of anyone that didnt like him
315228 theres really nothing to feel other than it shouldnt have been tim he did nothing wrong there was no reason why it should have been tim
315229 psychosis or substance abuse potentially a combination of the two
315230 this is apparently bizarre behaviour no provocation no history between victim and offender so im thinking there was something going on in the offenders mind that led to this attack
315231 it could have been a physical appearance of the victim caused a flashback to some memory what the victim was wearing the music coming out of the headphones there has to have been some particular trigger that led to this kind of an outburst when youve got a perpetrator and a victim who are absolute strangers to each other clearly its not personal because theres no history
315232 we all like to have control over whats going on in our environment and the difficulty is we dont know who the person is that is sitting next to us
315233 again what leads to people being concerned about it is so what am i supposed to do and it appears to be entirely random and so the answer is theres not much you can do
315234 the guy just took a knife out and stabbed him started stabbing him like crazy and cut his head off
315235 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
315236 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
315237 we were telling him stay put stay put stay there dont try to come out he tried to get the bus working and the bus driver disabled the bus somehow in the back im not sure how he did it and at that point i think the police showed up
315238 want zo te zien bent u niet al te lang
315239 i have done everything i know how to do my dog still isnt behaving i am soooo frustrated ps its all his fault

315254 about 17 percent of the bridges in the state of colorado are either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete in other words they are not able to do the job were asking them to do
315255 the biggest change weve made is a higher level of inspection
315256 now what we do is take into account changes in the weight and character of the bridge
315257 we need to get the additional funding streams and thats what the legislators are talking about right now

315273 this has been the worst six weeks of my life
315274 this is why we got passports this is why we cut our schedules back without knowing why
315275 on the other side of the world were still able to communicate
315276 fit in a little better i was shocked at how they identified me as an elder of the team i felt accepted elder to elder

315283 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
315284 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 of immediate relief

315288 in a word the word father is an epitome of the whole gospel
315289 probably acting on their own and going against official policy
315290 if your perception as the pakistan army is that raw the indian intelligence agency and the cia are acting in unison then you try to protect yourself
315291 you do not give them the taliban sufficient room to completely take over afghanistan but you do enough to stop growing indian influence
315292 the biggest issue is not what pakistan is doing in afghanistan it is its unwillingness to target any militant organisation on pakistani soil
315293 in order to become a better society we need to overcome this basic problem of communication we need to speak the truth not our own personal truth we need to rid our discussions of the stereotypes the advertisements the put downs and especially the lies in doing so we will be able to discuss what is really important the ideas

315297 to keep face in asia is of paramount importance all the chinese specialists will tell you that only one thing works respectful quiet but firm discussion
315298 otherwise the chinese will close themselves that is what is happening today there is a lot of protest a lot of very strong verbal power and the chinese they close themselves
315299 it took us 200 years to evolve from the french revolution china started in 1949
315300 it was only 40 years ago that we gave liberty to the colonies lets be a little bit more modest
315301 the games we believe will have a good influence on social evolution in china and the chinese admit it themselves
315302 we have been able to achieve something i am not quite sure that heads of government have achieved much more than we have done

315308 i log on to view domestic and foreign news to learn what interests people on the internet and to solicit their advice and opinions about the work of our government and party

315310 we must listen to the people and lean on their wisdom to do a good job
315311 my daughters father is british my moms brother is married to a russian i have a brother in china engaged to a chinese woman

315321 who burns defaces insults or tramps on the national flag or insignia
315322 it is a catastrophic year for chinese tourism in france

315324 chinese tourists who have already received their visas and paid for their trips wont cancel the flow of visitors will likely drop in the months to come
315325 trying along with the french ambassador in china to clarify the situation
315326 its not that the government believes this but it had to choose a date so why not respect the peoples feelings
315327 good government preserved the harmony between man and nature if a ruler fell down on the job there would be strains on the natural order reflected by catastrophes such as floods droughts and earthquakes
315328 and as a matter of popular belief it is still there
315329 not everyone believes these rumors but people will spend money to buy peace of mind
315330 they are looking for psychological security in a society with big changes every day

315336 help quake affected people during the holiday by various means
315337 overtime pay to send zongzi to them especially children and to extend condolence to them
315338 for the countrymen who died at the wenchuan earthquake i wish them peace in heaven
315339 i want to use this opportunity to wish all the people in sichuan and people in china happiness and safety our country is even stronger and come on sichuan come on china
315340 i wish my little friends from the earthquake affected areas can recover soon and come back to school we are families
315341 we came here to pray especially for the people affected by the earthquake and it is different from that of previous years the dragon boat races were replaced by the vigil because it was not the time for celebration and i think it is more meaningful and fits the current situation i want my child to feel that we are all from a big family
315342 i dont know if china is any different but our relationship with china is certainly different
315343 were in hock to the chinese up to our eyeballs because of the war in iraq for one thing
315344 so i think our relationship with china has certainly changed

315350 cnn is a network that reports the news in an objective and balanced fashion
315351 on this occasion jack was offering his strongly held opinion of the chinese government not the chinese people a point he subsequently clarified on the situation room on april 14
315352 it should be noted that over many years jack cafferty has expressed critical comments on many governments including the u s government and its leaders
315353 it maliciously attacks all chinese this would not be accepted if it was directed at any other ethnic group
315354 we continue to import their junk with the lead paint on them and the poisoned pet food and export jobs to places where you can pay workers a dollar a month to turn out the stuff that were buying from wal mart so i think our relationship with china has certainly changed i think theyre basically the same bunch of goons and thugs theyve been for the last 50 years
315355 in this occasion jack was offering his strongly held opinion of the chinese government not the chinese people
315356 it should be noted that over many years jack cafferty has expressed critical comments on many governments including the u s government and its leaders
315357 most of these people are american citizens and legal resident aliens

315462 he didnt get eaten at all he did a pretty good job of playing last year this year he has a training camp under his belt and a little consistency so its going to be good for him
315463 hes a rookie right now to this training camp thing

315465 i feel like a fifth year player from what i experienced last year
315466 i was going against randy moss and chad johnson and a couple of those great receivers
315467 i think the coaches did a great job of just giving me the basic things to do on defense
315468 now you look at it and youre like dang i did this or did that they just said it was ok and just be patient
315469 im definitely smarter im just a student of the game im getting more wisdom in my brain and listening to coach and taking heed of it
315470 you never know what youre going to get from your freshman year to your sophomore year especially if a guy has got a ton of success
315471 and darrelle really did have a nice season last year for such a young guy and hes responded in ways as a coach youre always excited to see
315472 i understand the defensive schemes more and i understand what im supposed to do at certain times
315473 last year i knew a couple of plays in the playbook and now its being smarter and learning the whole defense
315474 thats an area that weve got to keep developing with him

315511 we all have to pay the cost of creating potable water but when you start creating these huge costs for water thats a problem

315525 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
315526 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
315527 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
315528 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
315529 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
315530 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
315531 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
315532 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact

315541 when it comes to men that are romantically interested in you its really simple just ignore everything they say and only pay attention to what they do
315542 microscope camera amp software arrived in three days well packaged amp priced
315543 to minimize dust entering the camera through the lens mount
315544 i want what i want because i want it that way amp thats just how it is
315545 drink down that gin and kerosine and come spit off with bridges with me just to keep us warm light a match and leave me be
315546 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
315547 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
315548 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
315549 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
315550 either you stay with the stooges or you are the enemy
315551 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
315552 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
315553 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
315554 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
315555 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
315556 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
315557 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
315558 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
315559 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
315560 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
315561 who are open to doing something on the production side
315562 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
315563 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
315564 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
315565 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
315566 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
315567 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
315568 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
315569 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
315570 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
315571 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
315572 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
315573 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
315574 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
315575 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
315576 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
315577 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
315578 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
315579 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
315580 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
315581 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
315582 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
315583 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
315584 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
315585 by far the greatest hurdle for residents amp taxpayers has been your city councils penchant for accepting low standards ask yourselves if you believe your current city council is capable of bucking that trend
315586 dont be fooled this isnt the end of development on the wetlands
315587 the developers are completely arrogant and think they can ignore height density and most importantly what is suppose to be built on that parcel
315588 im not an immigrant i have a graduate degree therefore can read and i use the library and considering i live in long beach do you i know that my neighbors can read and use the library
315589 the bs parking commission recently changed the hours of the meters and upped the cost for people to park it might be fun to track how little they are now contributing in real dollars to the fund
315590 phoenix ap the illegal immigrant population has fallen an estimated 11 percent nationwide
315591 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
315592 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
315593 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
315594 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
315595 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
315596 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
315597 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
315598 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
315599 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
315600 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
315601 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
315602 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
315603 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
315604 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
315605 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
315606 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
315607 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
315608 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
315609 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
315610 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
315611 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
315612 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
315613 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
315614 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
315615 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
315616 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
315617 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
315618 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
315619 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
315620 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
315621 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
315622 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
315623 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
315624 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
315625 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
315626 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
315627 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
315628 if we can make sure more people are in livable wage jobs crime does decrease more people are thriving less people are desperate theres a connection between the two and our goal is to work towards the long term the shorter term solutions are more cops on the streets and different types of policing
315629 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
315630 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
315631 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
315632 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
315633 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
315634 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
315635 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
315636 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
315637 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
315638 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
315639 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
315640 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
315641 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
315642 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
315643 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
315644 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
315645 we want chinese consumers to know this brand as modern gentleman to see that this brand represents grace and style
315646 its the realities of the market looking at it we decided we had about 1 200 employees in excess
315647 running is a big question mark thats there each and every day
315648 since nafta was concluded it has contributed to strong job growth and flourishing trade
315649 f the industry and i felt ashamed of myself because here is this young girl doing whatever the fuck she wants to
315650 todays announcement underscores that despite the challenges facing all banks today the current environment also presents opportunities for strong institutions like suntrust to expand our client base
315651 in addition we are pleased to be in a position to support the fdic in its effort to resolve a problematic situation while also offering former first priority customers the advantages of banking with suntrust
315652 we look forward to welcoming first priority customers and soon offering them the channels choices and convenience enjoyed by existing suntrust customers
315653 theres no question the challenging u s macroeconomic environment has hindered our ability to grow the top line and we have a greater share of our business in the u s than our peers
315654 niagara and open source products represent how the company is being rebuilt
315655 people moving to niagara are doing so because they are constrained by their electrical budget or are dealing with space constraints in their datacenters and need maximum power and performance efficiency
315656 we dont expect of growth until second half of the year and dont expect a lot then
315657 los desechos no son un problema son una oportunidad lo hemos visto con el reciclaje y ahora con la bo iga
315658 procesamos unos 280 kilos diarios de bo iga con el gas que producimos ahorramos 80 000 al mes en electricidad y 480 000 en abono para los pastos
315659 as producimos el abono para los pastos combinado con el fertilizante
315660 police you shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
315661 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
315662 its the most selfish group of companies that ive ever seen
315663 the thing that pisses me off is that microsoft is not advancing the zune software its obviously the bastard child in microsofts product line
315664 i also like watching movies on it i can go anywhere to get ipod accessories thats not the case with zune stuff in iowa
315665 steve bashing isnt my cup of tea anger comedy can be funny ie lewis black but this isnt exactly my pleasurable read that fsj was this just makes you seem rude and obnoxious
315666 i expect this type of bs from cramer and his constellation of business
315667 the cracks are closer to the top of my iphone
315668 nothing is showing up towards the bottom i didnt drop my phone that suggestion is a load of garbage
315669 my father thinks im nuts he told me i had better things to do than to wait in a line
315670 we didnt break an old one we were there to have fun and talk about solutions
315671 were looking for synergy to get enough signatures by election time
315672 weve still got a few things up our sleeves for the american people we are about to buy a school bus so stay tuned
315673 what the heck is the camera angle doing zomfg i just got crushed
315674 the statement they made before i got onstage at glastonbury was come out and if youre brilliant youre brilliant and if youre crap youre crap and i came up and i delivered on it and as far as the rest of europe im being very honest i really had the best run i ever had in my life
315675 you did not choose me but i chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit fruit that will last
315676 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self control
315677 the one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it making it unfruitful but the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it he produces a crop yielding a hundred sixty or thirty times what was sown
315678 youre gonna see thats gonna go away he was not drunk he was drinking hours and hours before
315679 mr mac is responding well to treatment he asked that his privacy and that of his family is respected while he gets well hes doing great and hopes to get out soon hes bernie hes one of the best guys youll meet
315680 after the eighth album im done i have probably one more in me and thats eight like im one album behind nas and thats crazy
315681 hes pulling through but he has a long recovery ahead of him but hes improved steadily
315682 he looked pale the photographers tried to talk to him but he didnt respond some of the photographers got up close but he didnt seem aware they were even there
315683 jim was at the medical centre yesterday for a routine outpatient check up with his doctor
315684 she has no talent im sure paris would tell you that herself shes got a look that a lot of younger girls liked and copied
315685 the timing was right for her a lot of younger women looked up to her shes very sweet nice girl but thats it then you put a full stop its over so id say paris is infamous
315686 im not in it but ive heard that i dont think im involved im not planning to be involved in any way
315687 has closed its doors leaving investors scrambling to recover millions and pointing to flaws in the largely unregulated industry
315688 mr terzakis had a history of failed real estate deals and soured relationships information mr terzakis isnt required to disclose to potential clients now the two men are accusing each other in separate lawsuits of diverting millions of dollars from vesta for personal use
315689 vesta representative failed to wire her money to complete the property exchange by the june 16 closing and still hasnt done so
315690 vesta strategies held 10 million to 30 million in client money at any one time
315691 beginning as far back as 2000 john terzakis has been treating the client funds as his own personal piggy bank in order to fund his many personal business and development projects
315692 nations most expensive residential listing 165 000 000 and the godfather too
315693 the easiest way out of this today for senator stevens would be to simply announce a party switch congressman william jefferson democrat louisiana set the standard for the appearance of criminal behavior dont resign and accept the protection of fellow democrats and their willing accomplices in the press
315694 to inject britney spears and paris hilton into the debate is beneath what america deserves
315695 it was a way for them to get attention for yet another inaccurate misleading negative attack people are caught up with the gimmick
315696 most voters wont see the parallels between a presidential candidate and two party girls so a legitimate point about inexperience gets lost in the appearance of name calling
315697 when noah was 120 years old he took unto himself a wife who
315698 was 140 cubits long forty cubits wide built of gopher wood and covered with pitch inside and out
315699 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed
315700 do you like your religion being used in this way
315701 theres no doubt that we do this having reflected long and hard and recognizing the deep concerns and frustrations that canada has gone through over the nuclear history with india
315702 but you cant keep somebody in the penalty box forever
315703 the way were looking at it is that our relationship has been underperforming if not in the doldrums completely for a couple of decades now if not more
315704 and indias come a long way in terms of democracy and the rule of law and the whole nuclear constellation of issues has evolved to the point where we just cant continue with our position that has been absolute and negative to allowing india back into the nuclear club as it were
315705 the benefit is not in non proliferation the benefit is in potential markets
315706 our starting pitcher kept us in the game and gave us a chance to win thats all you can ask for
315707 we got a couple of good breaks in the sixth
315708 we didnt have good at bats we didnt do the things weve been doing all year
315709 sometimes you need to see a pitcher a second or third time
315710 we left guys on base but most of it was that we had selfish at bats we werent trying to go the other way
315711 stanclift was throwing mostly fastballs and we were trying to hit home runs he left some out on the corner and we didnt shoot them the other way like we usually do
315712 the really inconvenient truths seven environmental catastrophes liberals dont want you to know about because they helped cause them
315713 why dont we have more outcries about hormones and campaigns to save the fish populations why arent environmentalists lobbying on capitol hill to keep these chemicals from being dumped into our rivers
315714 maybe because the source of these chemicals is not some corporate polluter but something a little more dear to the left human birth control pills morning after pills and abortion pills
315715 the protection of the quality of our environment is impossible in the face of the present rate of population growth
315716 laws policies and attitudes that foster population growth or big families or that restrict abortion and contraception should be abandoned and comprehensive and realistic birth control programs should be available to every member of our society
315717 prominent women in the global environmental movement believe there are strong links between the health of the environment the ability of women to engage and lead their communities and their ability to exercise their inherent reproductive rights women have a stake in a clean environment because they are often the main providers of food and water and their reproductive health can be adversely affected by environmental degradation
315718 by any standard typically used by environmentalists the pill is a pollutant it does the same thing just worse as other chemicals they call pollutants
315719 outright denial at there being a problem obfuscation of the science when strong arguments are presented attempts to deflect attention onto much rarer and less harmful industrial estrogen and ad hominem accusations in this case an allegation of religious zealotry being in the pay of the very well funded pro life industry i imagine the effort will be based on making it unacceptable to bring up the issue in polite conversation such that anyone who does so will end up stigmatized astonishing how often the left resorts to shame rather than thinking about guilt some radical greens may actually be honest enough to admit there is a problem they will be marginalized by the environmental industrial entertainment complex to paraphrase fox mulder
315720 the epa and fda ought to have the courage to do what their counterparts in the u k had the courage to do and label the pill as the pollutant it is
315721 having your voice listened to is a privilege not a right and its a privilege thats earned in proportion to the contribution level not volume level
315722 to turn the residents life into a living hell forcing them to leave
315723 one of the most amazing things that weve read during this month is that israeli settlers have been bringing chests filled with rats and releasing them in the old citys arab neighborhoods they breed and have become a major curse the arab residents efforts to counter this infestation have failed especially since cats run away from these rats because of their size and ferocity all of the conventional efforts to kill them have not succeeded because they seem to be immune to poison and they breed in the sewers it is known that this female rat gives birth seven times a year each time giving birth to 20 babies which compels jerusalems arabs today to face the dangers of settlement and the infestation of rats
315724 large numbers of israeli settlers have been bringing huge cages full of rats and releasing them onto the streets and alleys of the old city jerusalem in order to turn the arab residents life into a living hell forcing then to leave
315725 indiscriminate or excessive use of force by the israeli defense forces idf
315726 long standing patterns of human rights violation suffered almost exclusively by palestinians at the hands of the israeli forces
315727 israel palestinian authority gaza bus bombing condemned all deliberate attacks on children must be investigated prosecuted
315728 indiscriminate or excessive use of force by the israeli defense forces idf
315729 photographs taken by journalists showed a pattern of bullet holes in the wall where the two were sheltering this suggested that jamal and muhammad al dura were targeted by the israeli post opposite where they were cowering
315730 one of the many long standing patterns of human rights violation suffered almost exclusively by palestinians at the hands of the israeli forces
315731 you know mom christine thinks you should flat iron your hair and we talked it over with her and we agree its okay dont be afraid well go with you to the salon to support you and we promise not to laugh if it looks bad
315732 the travesty of durban ii as a vehicle for getting serious about combating racism is more obvious than ever as a regime whose president is a holocaust denier acquires an important role in shaping the result

315770 i am a democrat and here is my energy plan
315771 obviously hes part of the green bay packers this offer is really something that has been out there all along
315772 this is bigger than all of us bigger than the organization and bigger than brett favre

315774 i dont know if anyone would hate him for it
315775 not too many guys get that kind of offer to retire

315789 when such ecological situations occur people tend to move to another place such mass movement leads to war like in the 13th century when the mongolians suffered a drought and they invaded china or the manchurians who moved into central china in 17th century because conditions in the northeast were terrible during the cooling period
315790 theres quite few people here who are open minded and will listen and even if they dont agree with me i at least thank them for listening ive dealt with other people who insult me and then walk away
315791 i cant understand how higher managers continue to maintain high salaries and the people who are working the baggage handlers flight attendants loaders are getting cut
315792 theyre laying off people so im wondering where the expenses are
315793 you pay more and more money for less and less service

315798 fate brought the two of you together and nothing can ever tear you apart you are as good as a daughter to me and i know you will take care of my daughter like she was your own sister as well
315799 what the hell i thought i was doing you a favour
315800 youre here for your mother you should be concentrating on staying with her instead of messaing around with us
315801 your wedding is only one day for the things you did for me for my wedding this is the least that i could do
315802 5 course wine chillied peanuts and a raw egg in a cup
315803 dont you need a good flashgun if youre going to do any photography in the restaurant
315804 can i request something can liza and winston leave the room i need to talk to the rest of us about something
315805 well michelle is an authority in the matter of weddings she is a wedding planner at the end of the day
315806 shes taking this wedding thing a bit too seriously though are you scared of her
315807 yes but thats the michelle i know and i expected nothing less because she will give her all to her friends when they need her
315808 the reason why i asked you to leave the table was because after what ken said about the flashgun it got me to thinking that you guys are really going to need a pro photographer based on my experience in hiring friends there will always be complications because friends dont necessarily know what are the more important pictures that have to be taken that day
315809 so i talked with the rest of the guys here and we have all agreed as a wedding gift to you we will help you hire a photographer for your wedding day
315810 in my 30 years of life this has never happened to me before i would never have imagined liza and i would have with us a group of friends as giving as the ones seated at my table right now
315811 oh i thought maybe i would just use it to check email do a little surfing on the web and maybe play some solitaire
315812 but you were the one who recommended me this tmachine in the first place
315813 oooh is this right or is this wrong like we are a bunch of muppets and need to think about it go and jump of course no one in their right mind is going to condone what your friend wants to do why are you even asking

315828 theres a little straight stretch just south of here its great for mashing down the gas and trying out
315829 we eradicated both sites and did a burn on site
315830 thats one of the great unanswered questions of the universe mom
315831 i dont need to look at you to know that your skirt is too short
315832 as editor at large for elle magazine which is a completely made up position i believe it is beneath my dignity to comment on that dress
315833 i get some real satisfaction out of feeding people theres just a real morale satisfaction in doing what we do
315834 oh i think he will be a farmer from the word go
315835 theres been a world of change in technology in what we do but some of the traditions we still hold onto
315836 this is the 2008 version of the boston tea party
315837 we got this out on a cell phone and you cant see this anywhere else
315838 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
315839 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love

315844 there are a bunch of websites that offer to buy your used books
315845 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
315846 i feel my game is a lot better obviously the score doesnt show it but i know what i need to work on
315847 i gave it my best today and i felt like i did a lot of good things and hopefully that outshines the ones i made mistakes on
315848 i think if i played a couple pga events in a row it would be a different story its just hard to play one and then one maybe a year later
315849 i think if i played eight in a row and i missed all eight that would be a different story
315850 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
315851 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
315852 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
315853 this is in the past and no longer affects me
315854 ka n sprak tot god misdaad is groter dan zij dat vergeven worden zie gij hebt mij heden verdreven van den aardbodem en ik zal voor uw aangezicht verborgen zijn en ik zal zwevende en dolende zijn op aarde en het zal geschieden dat al wie mij vindt mij zal dood slaan doch de heere zeide tot hem daarom al wie ka n zal doden zal zeven keer gewroken worden
315855 they were shuffled around houses as we were searching the houses they were kind of like the eggshell game and we were trying to we had issues with that
315856 several of them would just set down and kneel down and pray some of them were sobbing but again we had only one person that attempted any resistance at all
315857 we will not be able to take these up at a later time and well have to wait until a new congress
315858 and in the meantime there will be much suffering and mental distress
315859 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
315860 the main reason for their enmity with this nation in the past 30 years is that they want to force the iranian nation to retreat
315861 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago
315862 and if you dont do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
315863 we must add large scale base load generation to meet georgias growing energy needs
315864 additional nuclear energy capacity will help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels at a time when fossil fuel prices are increasing significantly
315865 has created programs in the newsroom ranging from mentoring to specialized training for minorities who have demonstrated an ability to lead and assume additional responsibilities
315866 sharons accomplishments at the sun sentinel alone would justify her selection
315867 but i know many judges felt as i did that this is also a lifetime achievement award sharon has been a newsroom leader in some of the most diverse communities in the country and she has consistently worked to ensure that both her staffs and the coverage they produce reflect those communities
315868 sharons commitment to diversity and her goals as an editor have always been the same to develop the best most diverse staff possible and to produce the best content possible always reflecting the diversity of the community she covers
315869 to sharon its never been solely about a diverse staff
315870 her passion for diversity her unfailing good humor and her unwillingness to accept less than the best are reflections of bob mcgruders legacy better newsrooms producing better journalism
315871 listen we ought to call our pal and let him know that we care
315872 yeah the thing is im sure there are going to be lots of surprises and i dont know what they are and they always make me nervous
315873 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
315874 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
315875 amazing what some poll numbers can do do you get the feeling that obama would abandon the bill of rights itself if the polls showed it was suddenly unpopular
315876 arent following the rules of the road they put us all at risk
315877 i just want to help them get to a common goal and thats winning a title the last 35 hours have been a whirlwind for me
315878 just go out there and read the ball off the bat i understand what im supposed to do in center
315879 you think about it but its not like its going to define who i am you think about it every day and now i have the opportunity to achieve that goal
315880 it cant be that much different two guys that care about baseball two guys that care about how people play
315881 obviously hes not going to be the same junior he was in the 90s
315882 but i dont think hes going to have any problems playing out there in center field
315883 hes a different guy but hes definitely not a bad guy i think there was definitely a different sense that was going on in the clubhouse over the last week i think it was kind of uncomfortable not so much for the players because were kind of used to things going on i think the relationship with maybe upper management and what direction things were going he can be a huge part of your offense and all that and when things dont seem like theyre going all in the same direction it was just different it was kind of a weird feeling in here
315884 i think that its good for this team this organization right now that we can go on with direction with this team right now i think things escalated to degrees to where something had to be done either way we lose a hall of famer we lose the best right handed hitter ive ever played with we gain a very good outfielder and a very good hitter its time that this team starts playing better
315885 i think we should celebrate the fact that he was such a great player for us
315886 but i think people tend to blame or might want to blame him for everything thats gone wrong on this team so far this year i dont think thats right either we still have a lot of games left we have a very good player in jason bay
315887 aint no cleanup hitter like that you know what im saying good player did what he was supposed to do while he was here thats about it
315888 to me hes the greatest hitter ive ever seen being able to play with him
315889 i know theres other great hitters in the league i just havent been able to be their teammates his swing is unbelievable he really worked hard at trying to perfect it which seems almost ridiculous when you have such a perfect swing and youre trying to make it better but i think thats why his numbers are what they are for me a sure fire first ballot hall of famer and when he gives his speech hell probably give it via satellite because hes in brazil that will be perfect hell be wearing a brazilian national team hat when he does it and watching a soccer game
315890 i think we needed to do something to make our ballclub better
315891 if this was the general managers way of doing it and our front office guys way of doing it and making our ballclub better than so be it well find out if it makes our ballclub better in the next two months
315892 i really didnt think anything was going to happen so i took a nap
315893 and at 5 oclock i wake up and my phone has 87 000 messages that manny got traded so i had to get online and check
315894 its just one of those things where now you know what the future is
315895 before you didnt know what it was going to hold now we know what our team looks like from this day forward were happy that jason bay is here because hes a great guy ive talked to a couple of teammates in pittsburgh and they say hes a really good teammate and a really good guy if youre going to replace manny ramirez youre not going to replace his stats if youre going to replace him youre hoping to get a good teammate and thats what we got
315896 his whole career has been remarkable hes one of the best right handed hitters in history and his numbers speak for themselves he was a key part of two world series teams no one can ever take that away from him were not going to we dont want to we wish him well going forward and realize as we sit here today on aug 1 thats now in our past and were moving forward as a team
315897 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
315898 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
315899 no mccain got new information and after thought and consideration came to a new more rational conclusion
315900 but i am a federalist and i believe in the rights of states to make those decisions
315901 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
315902 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
315903 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
315904 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
315905 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
315906 they had this big red van and were always taking a bunch of kids to swim meets
315907 one time he demonstrated his juggling skills by lying on his back in the department and juggling with his hands
315908 the roman catholic church should learn from other equally worthy christian denominations and eagerly welcome female clergy as well as married clergy
315909 there are people who you just know are ticking bombs
315910 your movie reminds me a lot of the blair witch
315911 we have exceeded our target for reclaiming materials from the demolition and clearing of the site much of which has been used to create the correct land levels and roads within the olympic park
315912 as we move into the construction phase we have set ourselves another incredibly ambitious target to recover and reuse or recycle 90 per cent of the construction waste this is unprecedented for a development of this size scale and complexity
315913 give the assurance that our ambitions for sustainability and environmental management are monitored audited and delivered
315914 makes clear that the financial services industry faces difficult times ahead some of the challenges like the health of the world economy are outside the control of eu governments but europe can act now to make sure that financial regulation is part of the solution not part of the problem
315915 there is a lot at stake here not only do 1 4 million people work in the sector across the eu but financial services are a driving economic force accounting for two thirds of labour productivity growth in 2000 2007 worse still this regulation would drive the whole industry overseas taking many jobs with it
315916 both the tottenham hale and haringey heartlands regeneration schemes set out proposals for high quality and sustainable developments but we will need to relocate the western road and ashley road depots if these schemes are to be fully realised
315917 the marsh lane site meets all of our needs in terms of size and location and i look forward to seeing the creation of a new green hub for the borough
315918 and yes you should be able to use the rpf and rla formats though i have never actually tried that myself

315923 there was never a compelling offer put on the table
315924 i think you have overpaid in terms of executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome on the board
315925 its been about 26 hours in the course of a 24 hour day
315926 my support and my wifes support is with this board and this management team
315927 a partir de esta decisi n las personas que sean eximidas de la prestaci n del servicio militar no se les podr cobrar esta cuota de compensaci n militar y por lo tanto se le debe normalizar su situaci n militar y expedir la tarjeta sin la necesidad de ese pago
315928 en este caso no se cumpl a este requisito y se delegaba al gobierno la facultad de establecer el valor de la cuota lo que es contrario a la constituci n

315963 we are in talks with a couple of networks right now we have one picked out but nothing is signed yet
315964 we actually got approached about doing it by multiple people
315965 it was one of those things where we were like wow lets totally do it i think its sort of a fun way to show the other side of celebrity and a sort of semi normal life
315966 please dont let these horrifying images be the last i see
315967 its a great match that will result in secure jobs and a stronger economy
315968 while we had several attractive sites to choose from we opted for idaho falls which has strong ties to nuclear energy and which welcomed areva and its proposed enrichment facility
315969 it wouldnt matter if areva had chosen any of the other four sites it was considering for this plant we would oppose it no matter where areva planned to build
315970 we oppose expanding uranium enrichment wherever it occurs it is premised on expanding nuclear power which is an expensive and dirty power source
315971 they were given two weeks the two weeks is up this weekend
315972 negative consequences await if they dont have a positive response to our very generous incentives package and that would possibly come in the form of sanctions
315973 the iranians sent mixed messages this week and its very hard to tell what the bottom line is
315974 weve opened it up in areas of the country where we know the reserves exist where the infrastructure exists to get at it quickly and to bring it online
315975 so if we can affect supplies in a positive way affect demand in a positive way in the future it will have in immediate impact on prices today
315976 i think its going to take quite a bit of time before it has an impact
315977 and provided they do put the caveat in that the oil stays in the u s and doesnt go out in the world market it may eventually have an impact but i dont think its going to be dramatic
315978 it was bewildering and confusing and we didnt really know what was going on or what to expect at that point
315979 ive really wanted to see some progress made on the case it was frustrating it looked like it was a cold case and i wondered if theyd ever catch the person that did it
315980 i have some mixed feeling on it on the one hand it brings up a lot of questions and its a little bit frustrating for me that there wont be a trial to go through and explore some of this persons motivations for why they did this

316017 we have been repositioning our economy from what was more of a labor intensive manufacturing economy into one thats really driven by know how
316018 as i always tell people you want to have the challenges of growth and not the challenges of decline

316024 drilling oil off our coasts will not save us money until 2016 and that will be minimal at best
316025 drilling in the future will not lower the prices now
316026 every republican candidate for the house should state in their campaigns
316027 for the first time in my adult life i am really proud of my country

316036 typical of republicans so one sided on all the issues lol very symbolic that the lights went out on them sign of the times
316037 zif this isnt a cry for attention i dont know what it is cause i knoe these people arent that stupid to think that off shore drilling is a good idea but the mahority of the american people are dumb enough to buy into it
316038 there was a vote to adjourn sir but ill put you through to the comment line
316039 posted by george august 01 2008 at 12 52 pm wish granted
316040 so the gop wont leave until they give the oil companies more tax breaks way to go guys
316041 this is your boss calling to find out why you left work early today to go on your 5 week vacation
316042 it wont make any difference in gas prices for 10 years
316043 the most dangerous type of person is not the one trying to gain power rather the one trying to hold onto power
316044 i would like to regrister a complaint i called back thanked him for the transfer to a recorded message and asked him when she would receive it and he said later that evening to which i answered giving him an ear full turn the lights on now
316045 we are helpless we are awful somebody stomp on us the usa is evil

316048 be nice to the poor criminals he had it bad he did not mean to cut up forty people and blablabla
316049 the energy bill offers no immediate resolve for high gas prices
316050 when they refused to stop the proceedings the chairman did something unprecedented he simply picked up his gavel and walked out and just in case anyone missed the point sensenbrenner shut off the lights and cut the microphones on his way out of the room
316051 if clinton approved drilling anwr back in 2000 we would have it today
316052 i am a democrat and here is my energy plan
316053 i started driving home for vacation and realized i didnt have enough money to pay for gas
316054 for weeks pressure has been mounting in congress to approve more domestic oil drilling but house speaker nancy pelosi has held the line using her power to block a vote on offshore drilling
316055 even pelosis own california neighbors oppose her efforts to block new drilling far off american coasts
316056 we the little people who dont count and are to be ignored
316057 it wont save us anything at the pump 6 10 years
316058 also republicans can thank shadegg for turning on the microphones the first time
316059 i am a democrat and here is my energy plan
316060 but it wont help now it will be at least 10 years
316061 no one is covering this not even fox or townhall
316062 looks like the only drilling to be done over the next 5 weeks is going to be by mister pelosi
316063 it will take years for that oil to make a difference
316064 no one is covering this not even fox or townhall
316065 how about house members work like the rest of us 8 to 4 5 days a week
316066 zif this isnt a cry for attention i dont know what it is cause i knoe these people arent that stupid to think that off shore drilling is a good idea but the mahority of the american people are dumb enough to buy into it

316069 the dems cant post any facts to back them up

316071 where are the rpublicans during the rest of the time

316090 by the end of 2009 in order for there to be any chance for the nba to return to seattle within the next five years
316091 do i want john mccain sending our soldiers off to more wars giving big oil free rein to gouge us at the pump and letting ideology overrule decisions that should be made on the basis of science and health

316103 the only one who appears to be having any fun at all really remains brendan fraser who struggles mightily to interject a few moments of jut jawed humanity his yeoman efforts aside this is really a joyless borderline culturally insulting in the press notes cohen talks about his deep love and respect of chinese history an ardor which translates into pan flutes on the soundtrack and absolutely everyone knowing kung fu terminally dopey cluster eff that almost reaches ed woodian depths
316104 its impossible to resist such a massive onslaught of resources music and transparent narrative shortcuts meant to persuade you to exercise your right to vote i wont say its capra esque but its awfully nice

316106 elsa amp fred is simply a charming romantic comedy that proves youre never too old to fall in love and dance in a fountain the moral of the story is that even when one love ends theres always the possibility for another even at the age of 82 but what i took away from the movie more than everything else is that old people can get away with anything
316107 you must see this film if only for the sight of the painter tintorellis herd of girl groupies peering through the slats of his ramshackle apartment

316111 people when they have diarrhea are not necessarily thinking where did i eat last night
316112 it remains unclear how simple cells recognize what the conscious mind cannot
316113 this mental process will always be a little unknowable at a certain point you just have to admit that your brain knows more than you do
316114 i shall reconsider human knowledge by starting from the fact that we can know more than we can tell
316115 such operations resemble an integration of particulars by means of tacit knowing and resemble above all the seeing and solving of a problem i have in mind especially problems like that of composing a poem inventing a machine or making a scientific discovery
316116 what power and place has poetry in the living universe
316117 is to attend to alternative kinds of sense and if possible if lucky to come up with some oddly relevant frankly partial meanings
316118 in this way ones consciousness is invited to venture beyond although not to entirely abandon its most habitual and intrusive preconceptions and intentions this probative wandering sets the scene for the ah ha experience not only in zen and the arts and sciences but in any adventuresome investigation

316123 its really unfortunate to have alvin bowen go down like that
316124 it doesnt look like its going to be a good one so well wait and see but we anticipate that hes not going to be playing much football this year
316125 every player understands that its part of the game and it happens but its never easy to see it or happen like that in a public setting
316126 there was never a compelling offer put on the table
316127 its either made right on this side of the grave or the other
316128 nobody gets by with anything but we do just have to wait on the lord
316129 the suicide is pretty convincing evidence that it was him
316130 i made it my prayer and my hope that this is the end of it

316139 if each of you wants to pay 5 extra right now we can afford the fuel to carry the life rafts on our trans atlantic flight today
316140 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
316141 it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down your own debt
316142 being no 1 in the coaches preseason poll does have significance since its one third of the formula to decide who plays in the national championship game
316143 but the postseason poll is the one that is the most important
316144 everyone knows you come to the dmv to wait its sort of a foregone conclusion
316145 you get your little number thing and its like youre playing bingo at the dmv
316146 its insane there are people everywhere everywhere its like a concert in there without the music

316149 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
316150 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
316151 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
316152 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
316153 we agreed that there were certain issues that were not going to allow us to get the necessary votes to get to 60 votes
316154 we believe that its critically important that any plan be balanced that it include serious conservation measures as well as additional production incentives
316155 this is exxons drilling agenda wrapped in a veneer of other energy policies

316167 ok just an update because you seemed interested in my beliefs just assuming you werent trying to be clever or something like that since i realized that being atheist was totally the uncool thing to do i started looking for religions and i become mormon as of today my mormon status has been revoked something about not being able to worship satan so then i looked for a church where i could openly worship the dark lord and not be criticized and lo and behold luciferianism popped its little head so now i will be departing on a state to state road trip with my fellow zealots to burn and pillage the establishment of society that represents all good in this world and replace it with pure anarchy by then i will hopefully have become the leader of my church so i can ritually sacrifice my self you know commit suicide to become the human avatar for lord lucifer when my fleshy parts are torn asunder by the demon to come from my corpse i will have my disciples mail them to everyone i grew up with be prepared for a little surprise in exactly 426 years dont worry about that whole death thing i will command a demon to keep you alive until my rise to demonic power is finished hugs and kisses p s since you are so fascinated with my beliefs i plan on keeping you updated on every single detail

316177 why doesnt this bitch shut up and let me get back to work
316178 how to half the price of oil in one week or less
316179 anxiety that results from simultaneously holding contradictory or otherwise incompatible attitudes beliefs or the like
316180 there is no doubt that false and damaging rumours were circulating about hbos on 19 march 2008 and these would have had some impact on hboss share price it is difficult however to say how much impact
316181 has not uncovered evidence that they were spread as part of a concerted attempt by individuals to profit by manipulating the share price
316182 fair play to colly regardless of whether he goes on his test career must have been in the balance before this innings and hes played a typically nuggety knock when he and we have needed it most he actually middled a few too which isnt something hed done this summer before today
316183 i am delighted that colly got his hundred especially as it was a hundred in such dire circumstances but i see a pattern appearing strauss bell and now colly all got to within an innings of losing their place and all came back to make fantastic innings is this a sign that england lack a certain intensity in their batting normally
316184 cook vaughan and bell all need public floggings for their dismissals and then kp throws it away when sa were there for the taking barring something sensational over the next 24 hours this series is looking terminal for captain and possibly the coach who has presided over the complacency that has developed over the last year and a bit
316185 it is the context in which pietersen got out which has annoyed people we were really controlling the match the wheels were coming off for the saffers then kp runs down the pitch and hits it down to long on and its all fallen apart again you cant help but think he threw his wicket away there is attacking counter attacking and then there is just stupidly reckless
316186 there is no reason why with such a young squad why we will be less good this year
316187 we have lost flamini hleb and gilberto but we have replaced hleb with samir nasri who is a very good player gilberto only played 12 games last year
316188 when we started talking about my contract i never told him id be leaving this club and he knew my desire my desire was to stay at this club so for me hes like my father hes my boss so whatever he tells me ill do it
316189 when i was on holiday i didnt know what was happening about his future when i came back i realised what was happening but you know the thing has happened already so now the most important thing is behind me and ill show everyone this club has given me a lot of things it gave me a chance to be who i am today so i have to thank them and i think the boss understands that as well so now we are in the same boat now we have to work hard together as a family and to deliver better than what we did last season
316190 there is a game going on in europe where the big clubs tap up our players they let us do the work and develop the players and then they think they can just come in and offer him big wages
316191 i told you our players were destabilised at the end of the season during an important part of last season not only directly by the club you know how it works it goes through agents its a problem we had i have no special problem with real madrid but the rules are quite clear if you want a player you call the club and ask how much they want for him and if they are ready to sell him if its no you dont need to speak to the player because no is no
316192 i think its very misleading to say these figures challenge our the governments figures they are a different calculation altogether
316193 the photographer had to be evicted wayne was happy to co operate fully and to give a clear version of the events in which he believes he was blameless
316194 hes a born fighter and gets frustrated in some games
316195 i would rather have a player who showed a bit of heart than just accepted it
316196 if he didnt do that he would be criticised for not caring enough so what do people want
316197 i have to explain to him that he must not do these tackles
316198 ive seen the same thing in training it is normal for him and i told him that but i was worried for the other players
316199 at 22 he was never going to be the finished article
316200 when you sign players at 18 its for the long view
316201 i am disappointed that talks between british energy and edf have not yet been successful
316202 but our commitment to nuclear power is clear and nuclear new build does not depend on one single deal
316203 edf was the governments get out of jail free card which hasnt materialised there are tough decisions to be made as the reality is britain will run short of power
316204 conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date
316205 warrior not only in the etzel but in general after having fought to establish the state mother continued to fight for us doing battle against anyone who hurt us but also took care that we would not become arrogant
316206 in the end mother also accepted the idea of dividing the land after hearing about the steps i was promoting
316207 shes tough first on herself but on other people as well
316208 her friends are long standing and separate from her political life
316209 i prefer jeans to a suit sneakers to high heels markets to malls in paris i prefer the quartier latin to the champs elys es in general i dont like formality at all it is just part of what i do you know when i was young i went to the sinai and worked as a waitress
316210 sometimes there are guy issues not only in the war in all kinds of discussions
316211 i am good at persuading people in convincing the other i try to start from their point of view so its easier for me to find a common denominator
316212 we have seen a series of shocks in the last few months that have generated adverse sentiment towards banks like a amp l and particularly to banks of our size we can see potential shocks happening one of the issues is the sheer uncertainty over the last year or so we have seen effects on both a amp ls funding and equity valuation
316213 how many times has your gut ever been wrong when you listened
316214 so stop fucking thinking and just act you wont have any problems
316215 just dont think you will be fine and dont let any mfs tell you how you should be
316216 i intend to embody the air force core values of integrity service and excellence as i lead the air force at this critical transition period
316217 colonel bouley had recently celebrated his 20th year wearing the uniform and had more than 4 200 flight hours in the f 15 eagle the royal air force f 3 tornado and the t 38 talon
316218 he was a decorated warrior an inspiring leader of airmen and a loving father and husband he served his country with distinction and will be greatly missed
316219 the air combat command accident investigation board will collect and protect evidence from the scene and gather and analyze all relevant data
316220 as commander of this wing the safety of our airmen is at the top of my priority list
316221 protecting our nations sons and daughters is a sacred trust and we intend to do everything in our power to find the cause of this mishap so we may prevent it from happening again
316222 right now were focused on supporting colonel bouleys family and the men and women of the 65th agrs
316223 getting these oral histories now is important because once the veterans are gone their stories are gone forever
316224 all of them love their country and are here for all the right reasons
316225 the patriotism you see in these people is just phenomenal
316226 the projects are a combination of initiatives from within afmc and those from coordination with other energy offices
316227 all energy managers in this command have a passion for energy
316228 this is an energy saving opportunity we should be capitalizing on
316229 its probably been the most difficult six months in the fireworks industry
316230 you just didnt hear from clients like normally contracts were slow coming in
316231 fireworks are very popular as opposed to 10 years ago
316232 any event of any quality of any size you see fireworks
316233 the face of our industry is going to change dramatically over the next few years
316234 i think next year prices will reflect whats going on
316235 we need to be as efficient as possible so that we can maintain the bottom line
316236 the bigger shows maybe you make it a couple of minutes shorter and the town is happy and they really didnt notice much of a change
316237 there is the possibility that if the contract just becomes too unprofitable that well have to ask the park service to reconsider
316238 alckmin voc tem um or amento de campanha de 25 milh es de reais alt ssimo para quem candidato a prefeito de s o paulo quem financia a sua campanha
316239 sou a favor do financiamento p blico sempre defendi isso mas enquanto n o vem todas as minhas contas est o aprovadas
316240 o candidato alckmin n o respondeu minha pergunta que foi direta e reta quem financia a sua candidatura
316241 meu pai sempre me ensinou a ter uma atitude franciscana sempre a adotei na pol tica desde o come o da minha vida p blica como vereador da minha cidade natal todas as minhas contas est o rigorosamente aprovadas
316242 estou com um exemplar da revista the economist aqui ao meu lado e ela diz que o brasil o pa s com o maior juro real do mundo o que o senhor acha disso
316243 maluf o psol sempre foi contra essa pol tica de juro alto do bacen mas que que voc t falando do juro se o seu partido faz parte da base do governo
316244 ivan fazer parte da base n o concordar com tudo eu por exemplo discordo da pol tica de juros do banco central inclusive sou um dos maiores defensores da estatiza o do bacen pois ele agora n o pertence ao pa s pertence aos banqueiros
316245 according to one witness a lot of joking was going on high fives and then they all went to lunch
316246 i just cant deal with people who are victims especially if you are an architect of your own misery
316247 take a holiday like this and do something great for yourself
316248 they were so stubborn im going to be myself that they never figured out how to live with another human being
316249 my attitude is lets try something different and it only benefits you ultimately
316250 everything about my books is to tie everything down and get rid of the hollywood bullshit
316251 my own experience was that i find that valentines day is a fun time to actually meet someone if you do it right which is to go out with a bunch of friends that you love
316252 we made a few arrangements packed up our things and hit the open road
316253 okay so im kind of like a camel amp i can usually hold it forever but after downing a whole water bottle i announced that bathroom or not i was gonna pee real soon
316254 lucky for me and my cars interior we spotted a rest stop just ahead
316255 amp selfish little me i decided to take my sweet time in the bathroom as i left miss
316256 if you just heard of the concept of the show you would think wow the most successful contestants are going to be charity workers walking around giving money out
316257 but then when you actually watch the show its almost the same skills that would come into play on the apprentice
316258 you can see in them what every entrepreneur has the whatever it takes mentality
316259 the secondary art reaffirms how the art market is doing overall
316260 i would hope that it would give the modest collector confidence in the market
316261 were playing in numbers that are telephone numbers and so its sort of stops being part of our reality
316262 i keep being surprised that everybody thinks this is still a big story that art is doing well
316263 i just have the sense that its kind of the news medias attempt to predict whats going to happen rather than report it
316264 ill keep this brief its very dangerous to keep 400 people from an open bar
316265 it makes it very visual the difference how people live in the city
316266 i think in high school its when you go to other friends houses and meet their parents i think it can be an extremely jarring experience and its something you feel everyday
316267 is what every middle class family wants for their children
316268 so basically all they care about is your kids graduate high school thats one of our outcomes but were also very interested in the behavioral outcomes of students of building their social skills of building their life skills like responsibility and time management and all those things and those things we really want to track too and we would love to report those outcomes not interested not interested at all
316269 you know you have a lot of programs come in and they tell you theyre going to do 101 things and they do one
316270 groundwork virtually does exactly what they said theyre going to do
316271 the kids that i know that wasnt a part of groundwork in my school had to wait weeks and weeks and weeks just to get one fee waiver
316272 and that put a hold on them to apply to most of the schools they wanted to go to and they only got accepted to schools they had to apply to
316273 at the end of the day people do this stuff because they have to do it
316274 because they tried everything they couldnt do anything else this is what they had to do they had to make this idea real
316275 the other side for me as a website publisher is that if you do not give each software 5 stars you dont get so many back links and some authors are not very pleased with this and your website when i started download tipp de i wanted to create a site where users can find good software so i decided the visitor is important and not the number of backlinks only 10 of all programs submitted get the 5 suns award
316276 oh well what are you going to do about school
316277 to attack democrats for leaving town without doing something to lower gas prices
316278 at one point the lights went off in the house and the microphones were turned off in the chamber lets have a real up or down vote
316279 this band of brothers here is staying late to make a point to the american people we want to work
316280 the 109th congress vies for the title of the all time worst congress
316281 it spent little time in session it failed to pass budget resolutions and appropriations bills there was no serious oversight of the disaster in iraq there were no major substantive policy achievements and corrupt members were forced from congress
316282 grocery spending a married person spends 103 more on groceries than a single person by the way are you married or single
316283 you live with one other prson and you use 15 green electricity improve your profile by telling us about the car you drive and your flights
316284 you are 15 years old clean up after circus animals for a living and love britney spears videos on tv
316285 everyone knows you come to the dmv to wait its sort of a foregone conclusion
316286 you get your little number thing and its like youre playing bingo at the dmv
316287 its insane there are people everywhere everywhere its like a concert in there without the music
316288 im trying to listen with one ear it would be horrible if they called my number and i didnt hear it because i was watching denise richards
316289 this kind of puts an official face on discrimination in america against people of a certain class i maintain you have no more control over your basic intelligence than your eye color or your gender or anything else
316290 nasib nelayan yang tinggal di wilayah perairan perbatasan edengan negara tetangga tidak mendapat perhatian sama sekali apakah wilayah perairan selatan indonesia sudah diserahkan seluruhnya kepada australia sehingga pemerintah australia mengklaim batas kontinental mereka sampai memasuki seluruh wilayah selatan perairan indonesia sementara peta batas yang dikeluarkan pemerintah dan dpr ri batas wilayah ri harus 20 mil dari garis pantai wilayah ri

316300 keputusan itu sangat tidak adil aku telah difitnah nama baikku hancur dan juri pengadilan masih memaksaku untuk mengeluarkan uang
316301 to inject britney spears and paris hilton into the debate is beneath what america deserves
316302 it was a way for them to get attention for yet another inaccurate misleading negative attack people are caught up with the gimmick
316303 most voters wont see the parallels between a presidential candidate and two party girls so a legitimate point about inexperience gets lost in the appearance of name calling
316304 whatever happened in boston is in the past im excited man i cant wait i feel like i took 5 000 pounds off my back
316305 its just a new chapter in my life im happy to be here thats all i can say las a great city im happy to be a dodger
316306 i want to say something from the bottom of my heart
316307 i want to thank the fans in boston i love you guys i just want to move on im thinking blue right now im thinking about the dodgers i want people to judge me on what i do here not what i did in boston
316308 im going to start maybe stealing some bases i dont go deep anymore i just hit line drives to right field
316309 can i go and get something to eat get ready for the game
316310 im like a little kid now im kind of nervous
316311 im just going to be manny and play the game
316312 in our hearts it is and in the mexican community it was 66 then it went to 99 in a matter of minutes it was all through the agent scott boras and his staff
316313 ive played a lot against him ill let you know in a month we went through some conversation
316314 clean it up a little bit and make it manageable
316315 ive got to cut it im going to be looking like a baby
316316 i dont want them to treat me different than the other guys if they want me to cut it ill cut it it will grow back
316317 you have to separate the desire to get out of boston and the desire to get out of the situation
316318 im just going to play hard well see what happens
316319 hes been working at it and hes getting better but hes still a long way from being that shortstop that can go to his left and to his right
316320 basically we talked to him about this yesterday and he was resistant to it based on the fact that he was getting better and he felt that he could help the ballclub
316321 even though he may be able to play in 12 days instead of 15 i think we can take this luxury now that we have manny and weve got a little more bench strength hes just taking one for the team basically
316322 there are 25 guys down there right now that feel like a team
316323 it hasnt felt like that for a while and you have to feel like that in professional sports to perform at your best
316324 it didnt seem like we were handling the challenge up to what we needed to
316325 its an exciting time to stand in front of your players
316326 i had numerous people try to help me with my bags at the airport
316327 im going to try to do what i can do i think im equipped to handle that
316328 i dont think its fair of me to sit here today and look back and comment on why manny was unhappy its a question for manny
316329 he had a remarkable run here hes one of the best right handed hitters in history
316330 if i was a free agent i couldnt have picked a better place to go
316331 we were having a difficult time and it wasnt any one persons fault
316332 there was doubt there was even exhaustion on the part of some players and a pretty major distraction
316333 manny and i were friends of course im going to miss him

316339 as a writer do you put yourself into the character shoes a lot if at all or am i just imagining it
316340 on the subject of the back story of col cam mitchell that was written and narrated by ben browder is that to be considered canon
316341 i thought the back half of season 5 was supposed to air next year am i wrong
316342 dr beckett has a family back home right wouldnt he want to let them know that hes not dead even though he wont know how long he may live
316343 will you ever do an episode which features a specific earth holiday like christmas or halloween

316356 under a new freeland constitution it wouldnt matter how many votes were bought or sold so knock yourself out i guess

316360 i cant talk to that little read haired girl because shes something and im nothing if i were something and she were nothing i could talk to her or if she were something and i were something i could talk to her or if she were nothing and i were nothing then i also could talk to her but shes something and im nothing so i cant talk to her
316361 i hate to say yes now and then find next fall that id wish i hadnt

316363 no matter how much others mocked her she maintained her dignity
316364 harriet miers and josh bolten is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
316365 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
316366 i have not yet talked with anyone at the white house and dont expect that this matter will be finally resolved in the very near future
316367 it certainly strengthens our hand this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
316368 we look forward to the white house complying withthis ruling and to scheduling future hearings with ms miers and other witnesses who have relied on such claims we hope that the defendants will accept this decision and expect that we will receive relevant documents and call ms miers to testify in september
316369 i look forward to working with the white house and the justice department to coordinate the long overdue appearances
316370 im sure it will be appealed and it will go on into next year and it will become a moot issue
316371 unfortunately todays victory may be short lived if the administration appeals the ruling our congressional prerogatives will once again be put at risk

316379 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
316380 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
316381 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
316382 excuse me young man this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later
316383 why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community or black community in this country
316384 i think youre misinformed when you say not one time
316385 every issue that youve spoken about i actually did speak out of
316386 fluoride protects teeth from decay and tooth extractions that decay can cause children who drink fluoridated water and brush their teeth significantly improve their chance of enjoying good health and avoiding unnecessary and painful dental work
316387 bottled water doesnt cause cavities but if bottled water is your familys main source of drinking water your children could be missing out on the cavity preventing benefits of fluoride the vast majority of bottled waters do not contain enough fluoride to prevent cavities some contain no fluoride because fluoride may be removed during processing if your children drink mostly bottled water you need to be aware of this
316388 high doses may cause nausea vomiting a decrease in the white blood count and feelings of pins and needles in the hands and feet
316389 vitamin e has no value when applied to the skins surface or the hair vitamin e does not penetrate the skins outer layers and all of its claims for healing powers are without scientific foundation in fact there is evidence that when vitamin e is forced through the layers of the skin as with spray on preparations it can cause severe allergic reactions
316390 claims of favorable effects on skin remain purely anecdotal so do claims that vitamin e promotes healing of burns and cuts and minimizes scar tissue
316391 the assumption that more vitamin e is likely to be better than less is a naive and dangerous one vitamin e has proved time and again just how complex and sometimes unpredictable it is
316392 i dont know losing weight is just something that i cant physically do
316393 im fat ill always be fat im just meant to be fat
316394 ping pong effect could lead to a rapid fall in blood pressure hypotension tachycardia rapid heart beat and other cardiac problems
316395 the pure mathematics of weight loss is simple eat less move more if everyone knew that people would be in great shape
316396 troublesome side effects often occur most commonly the niacin flush intense reddening and itching of the face and upper body that usually diminishes after several weeks high dose niacin can also cause gastrointestinal upsets abnormal liver function tests elevated blood sugar levels and rarely atrial fibrillation rapid beating of the heart
316397 the flush is not considered dangerous but the sort of doses that produce it greater than 100 milligrams can in a few individuals produce other unwanted side effects including nausea headache cramps and diarrhea still larger doses of nicotinic acid in excess of two grams daily have been reported to produce skin discoloration and dryness decreased glucose tolerance high uric acid levels and aggravation of peptic ulcers and even symptoms that resemble some of those that accompany hepatitis
316398 high doses of vitamin d can be toxic the major effects of vitamin d toxicity are hypercalcemia high levels of blood calcium and soft tissue calcification symptoms of hypercalcemia include anorexia nausea vomiting constipa tion tiredness drowsiness and when more severe confu sion high blood pressure kidney failure and coma
316399 the margin of safety between the recommended dietary allowance rda for vitamin d and the level which is toxic in some people is very small the smallest for any vitamin some people develop toxic symptoms three to four times the rda thus the practice of supplementation with this vitamin should be discouraged

316409 inconveniente e inoportuno emprender en este momento hist rico una reforma de la justicia cuando la corte suprema adelanta investigaciones y juicios en contra de algunos congresistas por el denominado caso de la para pol tica
316410 las cortes no deben intervenir en la elecci n de procurador ni de contralor ni de auditor ni de registrador porque eso no est dentro de la competencia y el mbito de las cortes por el contrario lo que les hemos dicho es elijan aut nomamente sus magistrados y h ganlo por cooptaci n y as evitamos que intervengan el ejecutivo a trav s del presidente y el congreso
316411 el gobierno les est diciendo a las altas cortes les tengo esta propuesta y si no la aceptan dejamos que el congreso decida eso es como soltarle a los lobos
316412 neutralizar los esc ndalos de la para pol tica y la yidis pol tica por la forma como se aprob la reelecci n presidencial en el congreso hacer un acuerdo clientelista con la justicia y perpetuar ideol gicamente al uribismo
316413 cuando la reforma sea aprobada por el congreso ya el proceso de la para pol tica debe haber pasado y no se afectar a m me parece irrelevante esa discusi n porque el juzgamiento de congresistas adem s es un asunto excepcional
316414 modifica la manera como se relacionan y controlan entre s los poderes p blicos

316419 every time i looked over he had a lot of people around him thats just the perks of being a super bowl champion
316420 hes taken on a new role being part of the media so i dont really talk to the media that much
316421 i enjoy waking up when i want to i enjoy saying do i feel like working out nah this is going a lot better or just as well as i expected
316422 you cant beat winning the super bowl and playing the way that we played there is just value in the way that we ended
316423 i won the ring thats good enough im not going to push my luck
316424 that was the toughest team and the best team in the league that we played
316425 after that game we did feel like we could win it all that was the real challenge for us playing against the cowboys and i let jerry know that
316426 bretts a phenomenal player and person so its hard now to see all the things that are happening because i think it takes away from his legacy
316427 you just dont want to see anybody like that tarnished in any way because of what theyve done for the game of football

316451 net earnings have been impacted for the first six months of 2008 primarily due to the bank s vigilance in addressing the risk exposure in a segment of our loan portfolio impacted by the weakness in the homebuilding industry and the slowing economy

316462 about three years ago iranian azari musician rahman came to our rehearsal i didnt speak any of the languages that he spoke and he didnt speak any of my languages he just opened the case to his garmon accordion and began to play this piece in about five minutes i was overcome when our translator arrived i asked to be sure that rahman gave that piece for kronos to perform this music has never been notated before its from an oral tradition going back a hundred years when i first looked at it it was the most complicated violin solo id ever seen in my life
316463 i first met aleksandra when she was a student at the s f conservatory from yugoslavia and i said to her i dont understand whats happening in your homeland i try to follow it and i get so confused can you write a piece that would explain whats happening fast forward a year or two later shes written this piece it takes music from serbia albania and the surrounding areas she found a way of integrating everything she recorded her grandmother singing an old serbian song some calls to prayer some orthodox church bells and sounds of several wars
316464 here we are in the middle of a rehearsal and we realize that where homayun an afghan rub b player is feeling the downbeat is a completely different place than what were reading it took us four rehearsals to figure it out collaboration between musicians of different backgrounds can take you into all kinds of directions trying to figure things out
316465 the other day we got this amazing piece from this palestinian group the rhythmic track to that piece was notated in a way that makes it really difficult to do but you have to work with what information or what experience you have
316466 i think so much of music that were attracted to presents the inner sound that people are working with around the world this iranian lullaby was recorded by a documentary team from the bbc in southern iran in that particular area theres a large community of people with african heritage if i didnt know the music was from iran i wouldve thought north africa the essence sounded african
316467 its quite difficult in our society to find information about iraqi music at the moment i cant remember when this recording came out on sublime frequencies

316471 i think you have overpaid in terms of executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome on the board
316472 its been about 26 hours in the course of a 24 hour day
316473 my support and my wifes support is with this board and this management team
316474 it does look like they have support of the shareholders again but at the end of the day they have to focus on the company goals and execute
316475 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
316476 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding

316515 to really do an accurate job of forecasting air quality you have to know what pollution is coming in from upwind
316516 although the finding was made possible by a computer model it was greatly aided by the aura satellite data
316517 satellites add considerable vertical and horizontal spatial detail enabling a more scientifically sound way of understanding whether or not programs are making progress in reducing air pollution in the long term
316518 the combination of the increase of transported air pollution and the interaction of climate change and air quality really puts a greater premium on satellite imagery for air quality applications

316595 we lent by every possible means and in modes we have never adopted before we took in stock on security we purchased exchequer bills we made advances on exchequer bills we not only discounted outright but we made advances on exchequer bills of exchange to an immense amount in short by every possible means seeing the dreadful state in which the public were we rendered every assistance
316596 the old breeder of financial panics the national banking law which had been a menace to american progress for two decades has now been replaced by a modern scientific reserve system which embodied an elastic currency and an orderly control of the money market
316597 true some great event may prick the commercial bubble of the hour and create convulsions but while the secretary of the treasury plays the role of banker for the entire united states it is difficult to conceive of any condition of circumstances which he cannot control power has been centralized in him to an extent not enjoyed by the governor of the bank of england he can issue the paper representatives of gold and count it as much as the yellow metal itself he has a greater influence than is possessed by all the banking institutions of new york
316598 a crisis in our financial dealings has been met and passed without loss of confidence here are growth understanding and increased knowledge
316599 the policy response to financial asset deflation was not only extremely fast but extremely well coordinated us policymakers deserve the nobel prize
316600 the drain upon bank reserves was met in the classic way with a policy of free lending

316615 right now this wireless device p2p activity is not a huge problem
316616 carriers dont have unlimited bandwidth and the number of customers using the internet aggressively will increase
316617 the one reason the internet has grown is that the government has been hands off but they eventually may have to get involved on issues such as p2p file sharing as such activity does impact network and network service to other users
316618 this includes placing restrictions on accessing certain content and applications limiting throughput or the amount of data you can transfer and taking action to optimize or improve the overall use of our network and services
316619 we would review any complaints regarding the network management practices of any internet service providers
316620 they might choose for instance to prioritize voice calls to better manage their networks and ensure critical calls such as those made to 911 for emergencies are not held up in the network

316643 she said that she would dance with me if i brought her red roses
316644 but in all my garden there is no red rose
316645 ah on what little things does happiness depend i have read all that the wise men have written and all the secrets of philosophy are mine yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched
316646 night after night have i sung of him though i knew him not night after night have i told his story to the stars and now i see him his hair is dark as the hyacinth blossom and his lips are red as the rose of his desire but passion has made his face like pale ivory and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow
316647 and my love will be of the company if i bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn if i bring her a red rose i shall hold her in my arms and she will lean her head upon my shoulder and her hand will be clasped in mine but there is no red rose in my garden so i shall sit lonely and she will pass me by she will have no heed of me and my heart will break
316648 what i sing of he suffers what is joy to me to him is pain surely love is a wonderful thing it is more precious than emeralds and dearer than fine opals pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it nor is it set forth in the marketplace it may not be purchased of the merchants nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold
316649 and play upon their stringed instruments and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin
316650 as white as the foam of the sea and whiter than the snow upon the mountain but go to my brother who grows round the old sun dial and perhaps he will give you what you want
316651 as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe but go to my brother who grows beneath the students window and perhaps he will give you what you want
316652 as red as the feet of the dove and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean cavern but the winter has chilled my veins and the frost has nipped my buds and the storm has broken my branches and i shall have no roses at all this year
316653 only one red rose is there no way by which i can get it
316654 but it is so terrible that i dare not tell it to you
316655 you must build it out of music by moonlight and stain it with your own you must sing to me with your breast against a thorn all night long you must sing to me and the thorn must pierce your heart and your life blood must flow into my veins and become mine
316656 death is a great price to pay for a red rose
316657 and life is very dear to all it is pleasant to sit in the green wood and to watch the sun in his chariot of gold and the moon in her chariot of pearl sweet is the scent of the hawthorn and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley and the heather that blows on the hill yet love is better than life and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man
316658 be happy you shall have your red rose i will build it out of music by moonlight and stain it with my own all that i ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover for love is wiser than philosophy though she is wise and mightier than power though he is mighty flame coloured are his wings and coloured like flame is his body his lips are sweet as honey and his breath is like frankincense
316659 that cannot be denied to her but has she got feeling i am afraid not in fact she is like most artists she is all style without any sincerity she would not sacrifice herself for others she thinks merely of music and everybody knows that the arts are selfish still it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice what a pity it is that they do not mean anything or do any practical good
316660 or the day will come before the rose is finished
316661 or the day will come before the rose is finished
316662 you said that you would dance with me if i brought you a red rose
316663 here is the reddest rose in all the world you will wear it to night next your heart and as we dance together it will tell you how i love you
316664 i am afraid it will not go with my dress
316665 and besides the chamberlains nephew has sent me some real jewels and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers
316666 i tell you what you are very rude and after all who are you
316667 it is not half as useful as logic for it does not prove anything and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen and making one believe things that are not true in fact it is quite unpractical and as in this age to be practical is everything i shall go back to philosophy and study metaphysics
316668 i was coasting along at 5 under then finished 3 2 2 you cant argue with that
316669 ive chunked chips and ive bladed them it happens pretty regularly
316670 i worked hard on my putting all year hoping the weeks would come when they started falling

316672 i got into this habit of playing golf for the wrong reasons i wasnt playing golf i was trying to make the cut ive always been the one shot wonder boy make the cut or miss by a shot or lose by one
316673 ive been hanging out with chris smith and chris anderson and they tell me hit that driver as hard as you can get over the fear get up there and hit it im kind of excited and surprised this is the ryan i know if i do this the next two days and the next 10 tournaments i wont be here next year
316674 the last four years the sole income has been ryan hietala and his golf
316675 trying to make cuts to make money and pay bills its playing golf for the wrong reasons now she is able to contribute which i think takes the pressure off me
316676 it feels good to be here and know i can still do this
316677 i just woke up at wachovia went to the range actually past the range and went straight to the first tee because i wanted to hit off in front of nathan green because hes a really slow player
316678 if it was like it was last year yesterday i would have shot 100
316679 i did try working once before and i didnt enjoy it very much
316680 im just sitting in a bar with my mate and he said you should go somewhere i went ive been everywhere theres nowhere i havent been he said theres got to be somewhere i said well ive never been to egypt so i went to egypt
316681 im thinking im going to sit back and look at a few pyramids and take a few photos and all of a sudden shes asking me this is the fourth dynasty of who it was like hanging out with your headmaster for a day at the age of 40 it was brutal
316682 to me him not being here is probably the difference between 38th and 39th so i dont miss him but im sure the boys up in the big money end they definitely notice a difference
316683 i hit a pole probably going about 35 mph it just jumped right out in front of me
316684 with more guys though its harder to keep them in line
316685 it was pretty ugly i dreamt of getting to par
316686 i didnt have the ball position right and i wasnt making a very good downswing
316687 i decided to knuckle down its been a real good run
316688 this weekend is going to be more like this last 27 holes
316689 what the hell were you looking at me like that for
316690 i was just thinking we might have a friend in common
316691 hmm well forget it then not out of love for that bastard da ma though
316692 id like to know where the lying bastard is myself hes a dead man when i find him
316693 thats why i told you to freeze hands behind your head
316694 you fascinate me you are fascinating but i dont know a ma da
316695 i dont know a da ma either anything else you wanted to get off your chest
316696 xiao chu did you always used to talk like that
316697 listen to me you must have met da ma at some point maybe you didnt know what he was called
316698 o k heres the deal if you shut up about da ma right now you can see me again
316699 i have to tell you something i have to tell someone today if i dont tell you ill tell someone else but it might as well be you last night i slept with li yuyu
316700 i know what youre thinking so did she to begin with so thats what i made my main line of attack i talked at her all night standing up of course in her room i knew id break her about five in the morning just as it was starting to get light she yawned and said to me all right you win get into bed ka ching
316701 listen to me xiao chu im begging you now you have to change the way you talk
316702 the way you talked just then the way da ma talks
316703 here we go again who the hell is this da ma male female animal vegetable mineral
316704 look at you great fuck you look like youve just rolled in from the paddy fields
316705 its him youre meant to be looking at him thats da ma
316706 you could have pointed at any of them and said he was da ma for all i care
316707 no look again thats da ma theres no one else like him
316708 ill give him this he looks a damn sight more fun than you
316709 thanks for that thanks a lot if he was here right now then i suppose youd be panting after him the moment he opened his mouth
316710 you really think theres something special about the way this da ma talks
316711 of course you should have believed me in the first place
316712 more than met she spent a night with him just one
316713 yes but he didnt tell her his real name he called himself li jin the address and phone number he gave her were false too so when she tried to get in touch with him she got nowhere of course that was a year ago where dyou think the bastard is now
316714 how could lian xiang have got so hung up on someone like that i cant get my head round it that da ma he doesnt deserve her
316715 halfway through da ma told me he might not go any further than tibet
316716 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does
316717 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day
316718 to me him not being here is the difference between 39th and 38th
316719 sirleaf but is not involved in the kendeja project said security will be a major factor in liberias recovery still large projects like johnsons and the 30 million fund help signal that the country is open for business

316721 efforts at global cooperation are all grappling with the same forces a resurgence of nationalism across the globe muscle flexing by emerging economic giants such as china and india and a fraying of the cold war ties that bound many developing countries to the u
316722 the way the doha round collapsed is a preview of what were likely to see in other negotiations
316723 emerging markets such as china and india are taking a big role
316724 we are heading toward the fragmentation of the global trading system into individual trading blocs regional and bilateral which offer no guarantee for the economic benefits we have seen in the post war era said randall soderquist senior trade program associate for the center for global development

316726 the majority of bloggers and internet addicts like the endless rows of talking heads on television do not report
316727 they are largely parasites who cling to traditional news outlets they rarely pick up the phone much less go out and find a story nearly all reporting i would guess at least 80 percent is done by newspapers and the wire services take that away and we have a huge black hole
316728 were going to be in a position where were going to ask some young kids to really contribute in a significant way meaningful minutes on the field
316729 and they really already know the basics because weve been doing summer workouts and holding captains practices where well teach the young guys plays and get them adjusted to being in the college atmosphere
316730 so by the time two a days roll around we can just continue to just grow and learn some new things
316731 were going to have to have our older guys or guys with more experience really mentor these young guys because theyre talented
316732 now it comes down to can we develop them into a college player

316824 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices

316921 this is definitely my best pattern back home and it has always been my highest scoring pattern
316922 but i came in with an open mind and didnt want to think about what ive done in the past on this pattern

316931 one of the interesting parts of adult entertainment is taking an extremely personal action like sex and making it public to everyone yet every time i shoot a scene the sex continues to feel personal and sensual even with the cameras rolling and the more practice i get the hotter the result
316932 when we first met i knew gabriella fox had all the makings of a star she has a sultry beauty that reminds me of a young sophia loren gabriella isnt a big talker but she speaks volumes with her eyes control 9 is just a small taste of what this new superstar can do

316948 iran is continuing to advance toward a military nuclear capability and is heading towards a major breakthrough
316949 for us such a situation that iran will have a nuclear power is an existential threat and from the state of israel point of view it is unacceptable
316950 our estimation is that already by 2009 iran will reach enrichment capability and as soon as 2010 will have option to reach uranium production at military levels
316951 one thing is clear is iranians are continuing their policy of buying time and so far they are succeeding
316952 we all know time is a decisive element in our ability to change the picture and remove the iranian threat
316953 and the window of influence is becoming smaller and i believe about to close
316954 this was the moment when the rise in the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal

316956 i dont think our campaign isnt negative in the slightest
316957 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it well continue to fight and scrap all the way to november 4
316958 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
316959 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
316960 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
316961 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
316962 i think it has significant potential to be a valuable service to small and mid size businesses
316963 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
316964 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
316965 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
316966 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
316967 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
316968 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
316969 any rate increases would be on the heels of the higher distribution rates proposed by most of ohios major electric and natural gas utilities
316970 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
316971 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
316972 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
316973 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
316974 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
316975 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
316976 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
316977 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
316978 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
316979 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
316980 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
316981 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
316982 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
316983 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
316984 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
316985 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
316986 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
316987 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
316988 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
316989 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
316990 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
316991 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
316992 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
316993 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
316994 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
316995 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
316996 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
316997 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
316998 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
316999 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
317000 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
317001 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
317002 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

317019 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
317020 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
317021 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
317022 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
317023 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
317024 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
317025 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
317026 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
317027 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
317028 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
317029 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
317030 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
317031 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
317032 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

317223 yo creo que a la felicidad se llega antes por el trabajo y la disciplina es lo que quisiera de mis hijos es mejor para lo sociedad que no tuvieran apetencia de todo abusamos de lo material es en lo que intento encauzarles eso no significa tener una actitud dictatorial pero en esta sociedad parece que est mal vista la disciplina y la disciplina como el respeto es necesaria

317280 in search of winning a world series title that was important my kids are getting older and it wasnt the situation in seattle where i wanted to get closer to home it was a chance for me winning a title i think that was the biggest draw
317281 theres things that i can do to help this ballclub
317282 having a manager ozzie guillen who didnt hit very many home runs hes very keen on making sure you get the runner over and knock him in and thats the key to winning ball games ive been around for a little while so i understand the game
317283 i dont worry about him playing center field thats like riding a bike
317284 you know if this guy was out of baseball thats a bit different he was in the outfield for a long time hes obviously not going to be the same junior he was in the 90s but i dont think he should have any problems
317285 these guys have done a great job and i just want to help them get to a common goal and thats winning a title
317286 theyve obviously done well being in first place without me to this point

317293 it doesnt really weigh on me you think about it but it doesnt really define who i am
317294 i respect the game of baseball i enjoyed my time as a player and i will continue to enjoy it the only i really know how to do is play baseball i dont have fortune 500 businesses and stuff like that you think about it every day and now i have an opportunity to reach that goal
317295 my husband works in a call center thats why he comes home in the morning he always complains that the sunlight hurts his eyes and he needs a new dependable pair of shades the one he is wearing now doesnt give much protection since it is barely tinted he ends up not wearing it at all since im a student a second courser hes the only one working for us i want to win these shades for him because his birthday is coming really soon on august 21 and i want to surprise him with something that can be very useful to him
317296 this and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs when he first appears he is a protector
317297 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
317298 our enemies are innovative and resourceful and so are we they never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people and neither do we

317310 over the years retailers realized that store brands were not just something to be floated out during hard times
317311 all of us are creatures of habit and when things are going well you just buy what you bought last week
317312 customers are much more willing to try a corporate brand when the economy gets tough and when we can get the customer to try it they like it it just makes it so much easier for us to get the customer to try it
317313 just because its a store brand doesnt mean its not the best for your family
317314 the long term implications are really cause for concern for every branded manufacturer
317315 its not just price its all about product performance its about the trust that consumers have in your brands

317328 the air yeezy is inspired by kanyes love for high top designer shoes drafting from the collar molding seen in the air jordan v and featuring a thin midfoot strap hardly meant for support while originally conceptualized atop a dunk midsole the final version of the yeezy features the familiar shared tooling from the jordan iii and air revolution which most recently was also featured on jordan brands spizike and a lesser known model that deservedly flew under the radar the flight 48 its also the bulkiness of the shoes tongue that stands out most with west always opting to pop the tongue and leave the waxed laces loosely tied an ode to his tour the models outsole also actually glows in the dark as similar to a common glow stick if the shoe is held near light the familiar green glowing hue will radiate afterwards out from under the shoe this black glow colorway features a ridiculously high quality full grain leather along the heel quarter with rich suede making up the toe and midfoot overlays and patent leather highlighting the dominant midfoot strap

317336 we still love the companys technology and maintain that tomotherapy will remain a player in radiation but we are extremely concerned about the forces currently moving against the firm
317337 is this a pause for tomotherapy given these headwinds of the economy and two new product launches from competitors that appear somewhat compelling or is this truly a closing of the door on tomotherapy i dont know what the answer to that is
317338 what im beginning to wonder is will those clinical advantages be enough to allow tomotherapy to successfully take on a varian or elekta over time

317342 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
317343 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
317344 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step

317354 i dont really look at the paper so i dont know how much buzz is going on to be honest with you but i know i run good routes i know i catch the ball well i know im a pretty smart player and i know where i need to be so thats what i try to go out and do
317355 i would say kansas city by far showed the most interest
317356 but first and foremost we have a very strong relationship with the chicago bears recognizing rashieds efforts and hard work and wanting to reward one of their own
317357 its always nice to be wanted especially when you only have 39 catches in your career
317358 i just wanted to be somewhere where i was wanted
317359 they called me and expressed that they wanted me back here
317360 that made it a lot easier for me to say i wanted to be here

317378 i must state that i cannot even begin to express my anger outrage and disgust that a person whom i treated with civil respect and kindness and whom i thought respected me would impute such a filthy lie to me but that mr de borja would have the nerve to make these lies under oath is utterly disgusting when it was him who had come to me with the offer of the bribe
317379 i know that the lopezes will do everything possible using their money and power to discredit me this is just the beginning i know that they will not stop at doing everything to discredit my integrity
317380 you know justice whos with me in the car its meralco chairman manolo lopez
317381 i said in my affidavit that he told me his wife would be waiting for him in the car and he says now that manolo was waiting in my car
317382 its a free country let him file it and well see
317383 i was prepared the moment i signed my affidavit obviously i considered the consequences so i wouldnt have made up a story
317384 and my third comment is he is a lawyer and a justice he knows that a lie detector test result is not admissible as court evidence so why is he asking for it
317385 he is a public official being a justice so he must be like caesars wife who is beyond suspicion and to be beyond suspicion you must be squeaky clean and he is not squeaky clean
317386 why is he clinging to it when the procedure is so clear that the case goes to the ponente the designated writer of the decision and the permanent justice gets back the case once he returns from leave and can you imagine him going out in public saying these justices were bribed he is the one impugning the integrity of the court so his fellow justices are angry with him
317387 they are just casting doubts on the integrity of the justices in order to cast a shadow on the decision
317388 there are a lot of similarities in our affidavits but in major issues we differ so its up to the people to decide who is telling the truth

317447 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
317448 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021

317470 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
317471 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
317472 no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american public
317473 there was never a conversation that took place where we did not discuss shareholder value

317484 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
317485 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
317486 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
317487 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
317488 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
317489 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
317490 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
317491 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
317492 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
317493 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
317494 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
317495 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
317496 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
317497 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
317498 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
317499 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
317500 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
317501 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
317502 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
317503 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
317504 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
317505 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
317506 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
317507 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
317508 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
317509 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
317510 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
317511 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
317512 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
317513 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
317514 integrated into a mainstream investment process in a way that enhances profitability
317515 an inconvenient truth the planetary emergency of global warming and what we can do about it
317516 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
317517 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
317518 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
317519 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
317520 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
317521 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
317522 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
317523 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
317524 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
317525 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
317526 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
317527 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
317528 the music industry is a business like any other but at the helm of this industry is a pool of artists whose work often serves as a barometer to the social and environmental challenges our society faces
317529 its a bit patronizing for us 21 year olds to try to start to change the world
317530 especially when were using enough power for 10 houses just for stage lighting itd be a bit hypocritical
317531 ill be the first to admit that the music industry has some big unavoidable emissions associated with their business
317532 with upward of 60 vehicles getting seven miles per gallon for a single national tour the impact can be pretty staggering
317533 a majority of pollution and waste associated with music tours is actually an effect of the fans themselves driving to and from shows producing waste at the shows littering in parking lots and venues using one use plastic containers for all their food and drink etc
317534 its t boone pickens different political party different persuasion than al saying weve got to move to renewables
317535 the democrats want to just do the renewable energy without additional production additional supply and chalk it up as a victory
317536 distorted t boone pickens words when he said we cant drill ourselves out of this problem
317537 he didnt mean we shouldnt be drilling and finding what we can
317538 he just said we need to do all these things
317539 it helps underscore why we believe gaining grass roots support for the pickens plan has been so successful and is such an integral part going forward
317540 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
317541 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
317542 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
317543 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
317544 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
317545 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
317546 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
317547 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
317548 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
317549 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
317550 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
317551 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
317552 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
317553 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
317554 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
317555 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
317556 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
317557 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
317558 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
317559 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
317560 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
317561 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
317562 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
317563 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
317564 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
317565 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
317566 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
317567 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
317568 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
317569 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
317570 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
317571 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
317572 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
317573 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
317574 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
317575 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
317576 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
317577 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
317578 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
317579 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
317580 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
317581 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
317582 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
317583 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
317584 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
317585 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
317586 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
317587 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
317588 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
317589 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
317590 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
317591 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
317592 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
317593 if only al gore had stopped with the invention of the internet instead of going on to invent global warming
317594 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
317595 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
317596 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
317597 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
317598 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
317599 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
317600 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
317601 the arctic ocean is warming up icebergs are growing scarcer in some places and the seals are finding the water too hot
317602 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
317603 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
317604 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
317605 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
317606 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
317607 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
317608 many of those who are coming have told their work or families that they are going on vacation
317609 theyre afraid of saying theyre taking part in an aids conference
317610 i contracted aids after having unprotected sex the guy didnt tell me he had hiv i fell in love him so i didnt use a condom
317611 he was the first patient with aids in my town he was a soldier who had served in africa
317612 we demonstrate on the streets to ask for medicines but our meetings are set up by word of mouth
317613 we dont have access to radio and television to publicize our cause
317614 i didnt suffer too much from discrimination its different in europe
317615 but in latin america its always very hard due to the culture and the catholic church
317616 everything is shameful here its shameful to be a homosexual a prostitute to have aids
317617 it should be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed they will call him the one
317618 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
317619 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
317620 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
317621 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
317622 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
317623 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
317624 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
317625 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
317626 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
317627 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
317628 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
317629 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
317630 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
317631 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
317632 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
317633 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
317634 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
317635 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
317636 if the vice president says its do able i believe
317637 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
317638 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
317639 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
317640 la investigaci n p blica abre nichos para incentivar la inv
317641 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
317642 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
317643 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
317644 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
317645 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
317646 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
317647 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
317648 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
317649 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
317650 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
317651 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
317652 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
317653 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
317654 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
317655 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
317656 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
317657 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
317658 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
317659 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
317660 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
317661 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
317662 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
317663 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
317664 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
317665 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
317666 will not only harm the u s economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
317667 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
317668 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
317669 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
317670 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
317671 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
317672 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
317673 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
317674 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
317675 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
317676 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
317677 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
317678 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
317679 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
317680 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
317681 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
317682 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
317683 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
317684 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
317685 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
317686 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
317687 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
317688 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
317689 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
317690 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
317691 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
317692 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
317693 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
317694 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
317695 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
317696 we cannot do the job with renewables and energy efficiency alone
317697 we have to have a balanced energy portfolio that includes all those things in even higher percentages but also has to include nuclear and we frankly think that nuclear should be increased
317698 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
317699 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
317700 its a very aggressive bold comprehensive proposal and its great to challenge the politicians to go where they need to go
317701 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
317702 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
317703 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on
317704 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
317705 former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
317706 we cannot do the job with renewables and energy efficiency alone we have to have a balanced energy portfolio that includes all those things in even higher percentages but also has to include nuclear and we frankly think that nuclear should be increased
317707 the vice presidents main effort is to mobilize the american people behind meaningful action and less talk about global warming
317708 its a very aggressive bold comprehensive proposal and its great to challenge the politicians to go where they need to go
317709 none of us can walk away from this issue without agreeing with him that we do have a very serious problem and its only going to get worse unless we do something about it i hope to be a part of that and i would like to see the free market take the lead not the government
317710 it pointed out that the only way we have a chance to drive down oil prices is if we become free of the slavery of oil if we can give americans choices of electrical cars or biodiesel cars then and only then do we have a chance of dealing with this cost issue that is why 4 a gallon gas is not an enemy of action its an ally of action
317711 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
317712 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
317713 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey

317737 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
317738 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
317739 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
317740 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
317741 i always remember tim being an awesome guy with a wicked sense of humor i will never understand how a person could hurt someone like this my heart goes out to his family and loved ones rest in peace tim
317742 i cant see why this guy would even attack him

317750 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
317751 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our
317752 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
317753 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
317754 excuse me young man this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later
317755 why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community or black community in this country
317756 i think youre misinformed when you say not one time
317757 every issue that youve spoken about i actually did speak out of
317758 im happy with the way i played because i had a game plan and i stuck to it
317759 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
317760 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
317761 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
317762 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
317763 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
317764 you act like a crazy person you apologize but you never change you never mean anything you say to heck with this
317765 our findings raise the possibility that the physical symptoms of depression are particularly toxic to the cardiovascular system
317766 identifying the most harmful aspect of depression is important because we will then know which specific components to target with our treatments
317767 our study is important because it is the first to simultaneously examine the links between all of these negative emotions and sub clinical atherosclerosis
317768 in addition we broke depression down into physical and cognitive emotion symptom clusters which is uncommon
317769 no secondary prevention trial has successfully reduced cardiovascular risk by targeting depression
317770 there currently exists no evidence that treating depression will help prevent heart disease
317771 the biggest reason is that studies that would be needed to draw that conclusion would have to be large and therefore very expensive
317772 hopefully an added bonus will be to reduce the risk of developing or suffering from heart disease
317773 ultimately we plan to use the data from this study and similar investigations to develop a psychological treatment for adults at risk for cardiovascular disease
317774 we hope that our treatment when combined with standard treatments will help to prevent the development of cardiovascular disease
317775 i was treated for fibromyalgia 11 years ago and was cured now i only need treatments once a year to rebalance my system that got me interested in chinese medicine
317776 i have always had an interest in natural healing and a feeling that i might be able to do it i was curious about how needles could treat something but i knew it worked
317777 if you know which buttons to hit that is the place to put the needle and the type of needle you will get the brain to send the right stimulation to bring healing each point on the body is connected with an organ which is connected with different parts of the body and different emotions the treatment is for the symptoms and the cause
317778 i go for the root of the problem physical or emotional and what i cant cure i can help manage the symptoms
317779 it takes time but when it kicks in it works when i cant do anything i tell people and when i see something that requires the attention of western medicine i refer people to their physicians
317780 my doctor sometimes refers patients to me im pleased that many more doctors are recognizing that traditional chinese medicine and western medicine can work together to help patients
317781 its not a matter of belief it works because the needles are used correctly if it didnt work it wouldnt have been around for so long if people have had a bad experience with acupuncture i would urge them to try it again but ask about the qualifications and philosophy of the practitioner
317782 your body is your house and you want to have someone qualified work on it patients may have the same symptoms or condition but they might need to be treated in different ways its all individual im constantly learning and researching to find the best treatment for each person
317783 for me the important part is taking the time with people
317784 i used to go two or three times a week after work but now i just stay at home and go once every now and again
317785 i do more drinking at home now than at the pubs theyre more for special occasions since its becoming so expensive
317786 brewing is a major industry beer our national drink and pubs a treasured part of our national culture
317787 sadly the trade repeatedly shows that it cannot be relied upon to consistently act in a responsible way
317788 theyre increasingly more friendly to families the quality of the food has increased
317789 these drugs are renowned for inducing paranoia violent behaviour depression hallucinations and lack of cognitive inhibition

317792 you can see in higher contrast areas such as around her chin that its grainier than the first picture
317793 a quarter that surprises me that that many people would think that things are good
317794 i am going to be 90 years old at the end of this month i remember the depression very well this is no surprise to me things are so bad in every level or our lives
317795 but that disillusionment comes with a certain amount of hope
317796 its not shocking to me at all with the past eight years between starting wars and nobody really knowing why and being lied to no
317797 youre hit from the time you wake up to the time you go to bed through the internet through the newspaper through 24 hour financial news channels
317798 we still have 94 percent employment we still have over 94 percent of the country that are making timely mortgage payments so i really have to turn it around and say there are things to feel good about especially if you put it in historical context knowing weve been through these times before and they do pass
317799 as our emotions make us feel pessimistic our expectations go down
317800 right now its a good time because peoples expectations are so low oh my goodness that its easy to beat that
317801 some of the numbers look very bad and they are relative to a year or two ago but if i broaden the horizon and look out and more years 5 7 percent unemployment is relatively good

317808 people are moving online and there are going to be more questions raised about how moving things online subjects people to copyright
317809 the internet works through copying things thats just how digital technology works
317810 copyright law used to be this obscure thing that only publishers were interested in
317811 its something that now affects everyone when you change copyright law now it affects everybody who owns a pc

317817 the jurys verdict shows that dr paskon was contributing to a serious prescription drug diversion problem in missouri

317819 i know my neighbors driveway was broken up and they just did the slab on it and theyre anxious to see whats going to happen on it
317820 usually the sidewalk here is the owners responsibility the property line is on this side of the sidewalk but you have to replace your own walkway
317821 i think i counted up to seven big pieces of concrete that needed to be taken out
317822 the lady had a little chuckle when i asked her and she said no sorry
317823 i can get it done but then i dont want to hear the next day oh by the way were coming to fix that for you and its a little out of pocket expense and you know in this economy nobody wants to pay for anything if they dont have to
317824 if i cant get it done before then i was just going to put up tape the little yellow caution tape and dont walk here obviously but theyre welcome to go on the grass for now i guess

317828 get involved with them early engage them and encourage them to get help
317829 the perpetrators of workplace violence usually feel slighted by someone or offended
317830 it could be as small as a rude comment being passed over for a promotion or feeling that youre being treated unfairly or not taken seriously
317831 the list is as long as your arm as to what the rationalization might be
317832 a lot of people get promoted to the rank of supervisor but are actually incompetent at that level
317833 background checks can be a sensitive subject and some find it intrusive but its important for organizations to think about what risks they might be taking or possible liabilities they might face

317854 we have concerns about the 360 version of rage because of the economics of the platform in terms of what it costs to go to multiple discs
317855 there is disc space issue on the 360 and if we cant find a clever way or compromise with microsoft to address that issue even though we feel the 360 has superior hardware the size limitations may mean that we may not have as much texture density or resolution on the 360 version
317856 let me be clear this is an open question we have these tech issues and we are working with microsoft to solve them
317857 it means the new team is starting to move forward and get serious about value creation and not flag planting it underlines the latent value of the business
317858 if we could value the rest of the business as we have just done then we would be around 2 50 a share instead of about 1 20p a share currently
317859 we identified it as one of our lower return businesses and harder to grow we could not see a way of getting round it
317860 there is a lot of growth opportunity in eastern europe such as poland and russia and we will look at other opportunities in eastern europe we have a lot of work to do to fix china which the other big opportunity

317870 and we know that god causes all things to work together for good to those who love god to those who are called according to his purpose
317871 i dont really think about no 1 and at the moment i dont deserve it
317872 all of a sudden i just got exhausted completely lost my concentration
317873 it was hard for me to keep up because the points were quite long the longer the play went i felt worse and worse
317874 ive started to believe i can beat these top players
317875 i think they have been towing them around for about six and a half years
317876 i saw them at the april nationwide race in mexico city at the start of the year they were already purple im not sure theyre going to be the best tires to run on but if thats what nascar chooses to do then ill be the first one to jump in my car
317877 i think it will be like skating on skate guards i hope it doesnt rain it needs to be a dry race
317878 the track was diabolically slippery in the wet thursday in the grand american practice and my guess is that there will be a lot of carnage and we dont want that
317879 we dont want drivers out there in a torrential downpour but if its light and its going to be with us all day we would take a look at putting them on rain tires
317880 it will be a challenge because a large portion of the field has never driven in the rain
317881 the team came with a decent car and all we wanted was to be in the top five so we can qualify in the last group
317882 i mean with these things in the rain you just leave it like it is stick rain tires on them and go racing but i hope it doesnt rain too much
317883 they know what to do and what kind of car they need to be quick and you can see that already that the field is a lot tighter than it was last year
317884 but if we can run in the top five all weekend we have a chance to win this thing and thats all we want
317885 i went across one chicane because i just braked way too late because visually i never thought i was that close to the corner
317886 the brakes will be a problem in the race but how much i dont know
317887 thats the problem and being cold for practice we probably didnt get them as hot as we will in the race thats what experience gives you and unfortunately we lack that right now
317888 the first thing that catches your eye is just how many people are here
317889 ive never been to a track on a friday where the grandstands were packed i dont know if canadians dont work on fridays or what but it was really cool
317890 whatever happened in boston is in the past im excited man i cant wait i feel like i took 5 000 pounds off my back

317892 i want to say something from the bottom of my heart

317954 i remember the fire some old biddy reported my brother to the police for taking pictures that day
317955 and the police came to our house to question him
317956 mukasey is asking congress to expand and extend the war on terror forever anyone that this president or the next one declares to be a terrorist could then be held indefinitely without a trial
317957 this is clearly the last gasp of an administration desperate to rationalize what is a failed legal scheme that was correctly rejected four times by the supreme court with as little as five work weeks left in this congress there are more important issues than helping the lame duck president cook up an indefensible plan to lock people up forever and throw away the key with no due process rights and limited judicial review
317958 the attorney generals proposal would hide the torture and abuse conducted since 9 11
317959 this is one more effort to cover up the illegal activities authorized by the president and his administration attorney general mukasey might be ok with helping in a cover up but there is no reason to think that congress will assist him
317960 congress wont fall for this latest bush administration plan to cover up its wrongdoing at the same time that the house judiciary committee is investigating whether high level bush white house officials may have committed crimes of torture and abuse mukasey has the arrogance to ask congress to give him the power to detain people without trial and hide torture and abuse from the courts
317961 he wants a new declaration of a worldwide armed conflict in order to hold people without trial and then under the guise of protecting sources and methods from judges who have decades of experience trying dangerous international terrorists mukasey asks congress essentially to bury the evidence
317962 there is simply no need to invent yet another set of legal rules to govern the detention and trial of prisoners held on national security grounds and the rules that the attorney general is proposing are fundamentally inconsistent with the constitution the prisoners at guantanamo some of whom have been held without charges for more than six years should be allowed a meaningful opportunity to challenge their detention in court the handful of prisoners that have actually been charged with crimes should be tried under rules that conform to the constitution and that the rest of the world will recognize as fair
317963 throughout the course of 2007 there have been innumerable news reports detailing problems involving the florida real estate market
317964 i dont so much mind that newspapers are dying its watching them commit suicide that pisses me off

317968 o coward conscience how dost thou afflict me the lights burn blue it is now dead midnight cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh what do i fear myself theres none else by alack i love myself wherefore for any good that i myself have done unto myself o no alas i rather hate myself for hateful deeds committed by myself i am a villain yet i lie i am not fool of thyself speak well fool do not flatter my conscience hath a thousand several tongues and every tongue brings in a several tale and every tale condemns me for a villain i shall despair there is no creature loves me and if i die no soul will pity me and wherefore should they since that i myself find in myself no pity to myself
317969 the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious it is the source of all true art and all science he to whom this emotion is a stranger who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe is as good as dead his eyes are closed
317970 the further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life and the fear of death and blind faith but through striving after rational knowledge
317971 the release of atom power has changed everything except our way of thinking the solution to this problem lies in the heart of mankind if only i had known i should have become a watchmaker
317972 now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought the general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand thus do many calculations lead to victory and few calculations to defeat how much more no calculation at all it is by attention to this point that i can foresee who is likely to win or lose
317973 to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy
317974 judge a man by his questions rather then his answers

317998 ive been told i should write about more controversial topics but all i can say is
317999 law is a brutal business a lot of it is a devils bargain but i love it i love my job this whole crisis of the soul thing should be addressed before law school i spent three years in nepal i spoke nepalese and i explored my soul so much that when i got to harvard law school i couldnt wait to practice law explore your soul before you go to school and you wont wonder so much
318000 we gave the first video camera out in hebron in january 2007
318001 the largest number are in the hebron region where the most frequent complaints of settler attacks are and recently in the northern area and the region next to the building of the separation wall where there are demonstrations
318002 the project started as response to the need to gather evidence we were constantly filing complaints to no avail on the basis of lack of evidence or we dont know the name of the settler
318003 now we are going back and forth with our video cassettes to israeli police station begging them to press rewind freeze it is the bulk of our work the value of the footage is not only evidential it also has had a remarkable value in terms of advocacy and campaigning
318004 there was a conspiracy of silence surrounding settler violence in particular this footage is shocking to israelis
318005 they had rounded up the foreigners from the international solidarity movement and arrested me and another guy separately
318006 they put me in a jeep and started cursing me hitting me and using bad language in hebrew and arabic it had never occurred to me that they would shoot
318007 they held me in the sun for a long time later i heard them discussing what they were going to do with me
318008 i recall hearing a conversation about how to shoot me what i recall is the words rubber bullet rubber bullet i was blindfolded so i was only aware of their aggression
318009 it was only when i saw salams video that i understood what happened to me the guy touching me on my right shoulder before i was shot
318010 just before it happened they said theyre going to beat me they said they were going to send me to hell they know me because ive been to every protest
318011 when i asked for medical attention they said this is nothing we are going to beat you more
318012 these events that happen are often so distant or happen in the middle of the night where there is no media
318013 where weve seen there is a lot of violation from the settlers and especially where there are demonstrations happening and we want to monitor the israeli soldiers behaviour we are distributing video cameras
318014 it is having a good effect and it will stop the violations
318015 we want to encourage a mentality to use the cameras it is the only weapon that the civilians have
318016 in the beginning we were almost begging people to take the cameras with them when they went out they didnt see the use of it but after the media coverage over the susya incident weve gotten a flood of requests for our video cameras and those who have got the cameras are using them much more frequently
318017 it is one of the biggest victories because it is the troops not the settlers
318018 in this case it was remarkable that it was actually the soldiers themselves they did in fact open an investigation

318020 of course of course you are still young we will save your uterus you are so young
318021 the last thing i want to do is cut you open again
318022 you are at a very high risk to lose your uterus
318023 where are you with regard to trying to get pregnant
318024 we can put you on medication that may shrink the tumor but will put you into early menopause
318025 even if we removed the tumors your uterine muscles are so weak you may not be able to hold a child
318026 you should be very concerned about your prospects for fertility
318027 i dont have all the answers i dont even have a few but my eyes are on you
318028 sing o barren woman you who never bore a child burst into song shout for joy you who were never in labor because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband
318029 do not be afraid you will not suffer shame do not fear disgrace you will not be humiliated you will forget the shame of your youth and remember no more the reproach of your widowhood 5 for your maker is your husband the lord almighty is his name the holy one of israel is your redeemer he is called the god of all the earth 6 the lord will call you back as if you were a wife deserted and distressed in spirit a wife who married young only to be rejected
318030 for a brief moment i abandoned you but with deep compassion i will bring you back 8 in a surge of anger i hid my face from you for a moment but with everlasting kindness i will have compassion on you
318031 to me this is like the days of noah when i swore that the waters of noah would never again cover the earth so now i have sworn not to be angry with you never to rebuke you again 10 though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed
318032 excuse me young man this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later
318033 just be courteous and youll have a chance to make your statement just relax
318034 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same us government that you aspire to lead
318035 why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on the behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country
318036 hold on a second everybody i want everybody to be respectful thats why we are having a town hall meeting thats democracy at work
318037 he asked a legitimate question so i want to give him an answer
318038 never forget justice is what love looks like in public
318039 u s district judge royce lamberth accepted the companys plea to a single felony count making chiquita the first major u s corporation ever convicted of financial dealings with terrorists chiquita agreed to pay a 25 million fine serve five years of probation and hire a permanent compliance officer it could have been fined 98 8 million but prosecutors said they took into account chiquitas self disclosure and full cooperation and agreed to the much smaller fine
318040 for nearly four years the federal probe had hung over ex general counsel robert olson if he had been charged under a statute that penalizes offering material support to terrorists the ex gc could have faced a maximum penalty of life in prison

318045 theres still a certain presentation of the american press on the side of the people that doesnt correspond to reality
318046 it shows us in an affected way the psychological consequences of the petty bourgeois as targets of repression and competition in north american society
318047 plastics packaging waste in particular is a very visible part of the waste stream and its also growing
318048 ironically as we become more successful at recycling generally whats left in the bin tends to be just the plastic so more and more people are looking in their bins and saying theres just bits of plastic here why cant i recycle them
318049 a lot of packaging is designed to lengthen the shelf life of the products that are being sold so if you take it out of the packaging theres a good chance that it will actually not last as long
318050 and unless youre very very disciplined and most of us frankly arent then youre quite likely to end up by throwing more food away
318051 the american expression get a life is not applicable in france the french already have a life the non working life in france is what counts french people arent expected to be happy all the time its not in the constitution they dont have to put on that brave smile

318053 verily as sal t the prayer prevents from al fahsh i
318054 in a statement obama repeated three times he said what george bush and john mccain are going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills afterward an obama spokesman implausibly insisted the dollar bills comment was not about race what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington this is rich george washington didnt serve in washington either given that the capital of the country was first new york and then philadelphia his path to the presidency went through trenton valley forge and yorktown granted quite different than obamas as for the other presidents neither abraham lincoln nor andrew jackson nor u s grant was a washington time server prior to winning the white house obama clearly was talking about race he said much the same thing in berlin i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city did he merely mean that he has better fitting suits and a slimmer frame obama has apparently been spoiling to throw out the race charge
318055 so what theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama you know hes new he doesnt look like the other presidents on the currency hes got a funny name i mean thats basically the argument hes too risky
318056 consider the presidents on currency george washington abe lincoln andrew jackson u s grant do any of them look like john mccain actually jackson with his long thin face looks far more like obama than he does like mccain though neither candidate boasts old hickorys wild wavy hair the point is that his audiences and all fair minded observers understand that obamas stress on his different appearance from previous presidents is meant unmistakably to remind people that he would be the first person of color to occupy the white house hes entitled to issue such reminders but its appalling when his campaign fatuously denies that hes doing so

318060 for two or three of his researches he deserves the highest honor a scientific man can obtain but the sum of his work is absolutely overwhelming had he never lived the aspect of chemistry would be very different from that it is now
318061 what is needed is not the will to believe but the will to find out which is the exact opposite
318062 not one person in my neighbourhood has a building permit
318063 illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying palestinian families homes and lives
318064 the demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of palestinian communities in and around jerusalem freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by israeli settlers
318065 the demolitions increase the pressure on palestinians to move into the west bank so that they will lose their residency rights in the city
318066 this is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an illegal palestinian home demolished by the israeli authorities
318067 we estimate that there have been at least 18 000 homes destroyed during the four decades of occupation
318068 most demolitions are of multistory buildings that are home to several families meaning that well in excess of 100 000 palestinians may have been made homeless by israeli administrative policies
318069 its one thing to destroy a home supposedly built illegally by a palestinian but another to destroy one built with money provided by the spanish government
318070 it was an eye opener to realize that the principles of urban planning we are taught at the university are being used by the israelis but for exactly the opposite purpose from the one usually intended the planning rules here are designed not to improve the palestinians lives but to make them more miserable
318071 imagine your children leaving in the morning for school and returning later in the day to find their home their whole world has disappeared while they were gone
318072 its happened to my children four times its cruelty beyond words
318073 israel and the clash of civilisations iraq iran and the plan to remake the middle east
318074 1 in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judaea
318075 5 then went out to him jerusalem and all judaea and all the region round about jordan 6 and were baptized of him in jordan confessing their sins
318076 1 in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judaea 2 and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
318077 10 for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death 11 for behold this selfsame thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yea what clearing of yourselves yea what indignation yea what fear yea what vehement desire yea what zeal yea what revenge in all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter
318078 14 now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god 15 and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
318079 3 for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet esaias saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight
318080 prepare the way of the lord make his paths the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god
318081 4 and the same john had his raiment of camels hair and a leathern girdle about his loins and his meat was locusts and wild honey
318082 4 and the same john had his raiment of camels hair and a leathern girdle about his loins and his meat was locusts and wild honey
318083 5 then went out to him jerusalem and all judaea and all the region round about jordan
318084 6 and were baptized of him in jordan confessing their sins
318085 4 john did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins
318086 10 and the people asked him saying what shall we do then 11 he answereth and saith unto them he that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath none and he that hath meat let him do likewise
318087 12 then came also publicans to be baptized and said unto him master what shall we do 13 and he said unto them exact no more than that which is appointed you
318088 9 and think not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham
318089 11 i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and a yes john did indeed baptize with water with repentance b but one jesus was coming to baptize with the holy spirit and fire 2 whose work would be to separate the wheat from the chaff whose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire
318090 38 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
318091 30 and the times of this ignorance god winked at but now commandeth all men every where to repent
318092 2 and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
318093 14 now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god 15 and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
318094 8 and he went into the synagogue and spake boldly for the space of three months disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of god
318095 25 and now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more
318096 23 and when they had appointed him a day there came many to him into his lodging to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of god persuading them concerning jesus both out of the law of moses and out of the prophets from morning till evening
318097 12 that ye would walk worthy of god who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory
318098 9 i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ
318099 1 and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place 2 and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting 3 and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them 4 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance 5 and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven 6 now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language 7 and they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galil ans 8 and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born 9 parthians and medes and elamites and the dwellers in mesopotamia and in jud a and cappadocia in pontus and asia 10 phrygia and pamphylia in egypt and in the parts of libya about cyrene and strangers of rome jews and proselytes 11 cretes and arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god 12 and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this 13 others mocking said these men are full of new wine 14 but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of jud a and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words 15 for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day 16 but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams 18 and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy 19 and i will shew wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapour of smoke 20 the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the lord come 21 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved
318100 5 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost 6 which he shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our saviour 7 that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life
318101 prepare the way of the lord make his paths straight
318102 and why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which i say
318103 but today i have wandered much further than i should and i cant seem to find my way back to the wood

318112 is this the first time youve been to our little town
318113 i dont like to brag but were kinda proud of that ragged old flag
318114 you see we got a little hole in that flag there when washington took it across the delaware and it got powder burned the night francis scott key sat watching it writing oh say can you see and it got a bad rip in new orleans with packingham and jackson tuggin at its seams
318115 and it almost fell at the alamo beside the texas flag but she waved on through she got cut with a sword at chancellorsville and she got cut again at shiloh hill there was robert e lee beauregard and bragg and the south wind blew hard on that ragged old flag
318116 on flanders field in world war i she got a big hole from a bertha gun she turned blood red in world war ii she hung limp and low by the time it was through she was in korea and vietnam she went where she was sent by her uncle sam
318117 she waved from our ships upon the briny foam and now theyve about quit waving her back here at home in her own good land shes been abused shes been burned dishonored denied and refused
318118 and the government for which she stands is scandalized throughout the land and shes getting threadbare and wearing thin but shes in good shape for the shape shes in cause shes been through the fire before and i believe she can take a whole lot more
318119 so we raise her up every morning take her down every night we dont let her touch the ground and we fold her up right on second thought i do like to brag cause im mighty proud of that ragged old flag

318137 but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based president clinton was a force for unity in this country on this subject every american should be proud of his record as both a governor and president but we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united state of their own party

318156 suggesting that toby keith is a racist because of this six year old song about western lawmen not southern klansmen is ridiculous

318162 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
318163 using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues
318164 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
318165 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
318166 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
318167 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking sen

318169 my independence hasnt always made me friends in washington i was not elected ms congeniality in the united states senate

318187 the publisher of a 5 billion european newspaper group called me yesterday asking me about innovative u s newspapers to visit
318188 all the talk about saving newspapers is focused on finding new business models to keep doing what theyve always done which is like gm looking for a new business model to sell the kinds of cars it made in the 50s and 60s what the newspaper industry if it is to survive as such must find is a radical new value proposition for news something so audacious so self evidently valuable that if it can find a way to deliver it would lead to the rebirth of newspaper journalism

318206 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
318207 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
318208 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
318209 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
318210 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
318211 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
318212 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
318213 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
318214 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
318215 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
318216 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
318217 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
318218 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
318219 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
318220 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
318221 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

318227 he asked that his privacy and that of his family is respected while he gets well
318228 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
318229 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
318230 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
318231 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
318232 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
318233 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
318234 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact

318245 yeah well you know wed had problems over the last 10 years but you know i thought that when you put your hand on the bible you know until death do us part and for better or worse i thought people really meant that when they said it
318246 this is a simple divorce theres no custody theres just a big pile of junk that weve accumulated we should split it however the judge wants it and walk away but you know my wifes lawyer has told different magazines theres gonna be a war
318247 this is the money that i saved for my family and money that linda could walk away with money that i saved for my children that theyre just theyre just wasting it and burning it up

318269 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans

318282 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
318283 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 dollars of immediate relief
318284 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
318285 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
318286 excuse me young man this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later
318287 why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community or black community in this country
318288 i think youre misinformed when you say not one time
318289 every issue that youve spoken about i actually did speak out of
318290 what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates

318319 koneksi 3g di wilayah anda dari pemantauan kami memang tidak stabil coba bapak pindah ke jaringan gprs memang jadi lebih lambat tetapi lebih stabil
318320 i just flipped i was like a bull i couldnt help it but i feel so much better now
318321 i think i was just getting paranoid and stuff and i couldnt stand it its not like me im going to try and stick it out
318322 what happened when you smashed the door can you say
318323 how did you smash the handle thing off did you cut your hand
318324 i couldnt believe you would go without saying goodbye to me you cant go now
318325 youve done so well you have to stick it out now you cant walk out i was actually really disappointed im so glad youre back
318326 all this time since 2001 there has been much said about what our government wasnt doing and here we find out all these years later that the government was busy and actively investigating

318332 we do not expect that indymac will be able to return to overall profitability until the current decline in home prices decelerates and we are not currently forecasting a return to profitability this year
318333 because of the significant hits weve taken our capital ratios clearly have been depleted
318334 thats neat its a very storied organization so its fun to be able to be on that list its a neat feeling for sure
318335 hes been kind of a steady anchor over the years
318336 weve obviously had other players over the years the jason giambis the miguel tejadas those guys all the all star players but hes kind of just been so consistent over the years hes just a model of consistency and professionalism its meant a lot whatever hes doing at the plate it doesnt even matter because of his defense i dont mean it doesnt matter im just saying through his good times or ups and downs hes been so consistent in the field and running the bases that he just helps the team hes really big
318337 it means the organization likes you because youve been here a long time
318338 youve had a little bit of success to me its cool because its the only organization ive ever known in the big leagues so its a neat record
318339 dick green is a friend of mine he lives in my hometown so thats cool too
318340 growing up i didnt know him but once i got drafted and started playing with the as we got to know each other they had some reunions back in oakland so i got to know him pretty well hes a great guy so its extra special for that
318341 he is under the radar and its not fair to him
318342 because if he had more attention hed have a gold glove or two he really would and he deserves that because he really is the best second baseman in the league and not even discrediting detroits placido polanco or k c s mark grudzielanek guys whove gotten it in the past theyre excellent players too but he is maybe hes not flashy enough to get the attention of other people because hes so textbook with what he does but if you see him play for any extended period of time youd vote for him for a gold glove no doubt you see him play a series once or twice a year you might not see the flashiness that draws attention his style is very by the book does everything right as a manager thats what i want
318343 thats fine with me thats kind of the way i like it
318344 being on the west coast people out here dont see us play a lot because the games are so late for the east coast guys but i enjoy it i enjoy just going about my business and trying to help the team win i dont need any of the media attention and all that stuff so its kind of nice
318345 awards are usually voted on by different people so it doesnt mean a big deal for me so as long as we win and we make the playoffs thats fine with me
318346 its a long term thing that wont heal but i want to try to play through it a couple days arent going to be enough time for it to heal but im willing to play through it
318347 i was just telling him i wanted to be in the lineup
318348 he just doesnt have the range of motion in his arm it doesnt hurt him its affecting his ability to hit ill give him more days off i dont know how many
318349 especially for his size and no matter where he fields the ball the throw is always right there to the first baseman
318350 let me tell you something i dont go deep anymore
318351 line drives to right field dont expect me to hit 40 home runs no way
318352 i dont want them to treat me different than the other guys
318353 ill cut it dont worry itll grow back no big deal

318362 all quotes attributed to me on imao are made up including this one
318363 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and he did despair for in his omniscience he did know that his creations had but three fifths of the splendor of that which would be imao
318364 there is no arrangement on this and those stories are not accurate
318365 not only would going fully metric cost a fortune to implement in britain it would also not go down well with a majority of the motoring public
318366 it does seem odd that we buy our fuel in litres but think about fuel efficiency in miles per gallon we appear to be an imperial metric nation
318367 i dont remember much i had used too much drugs
318368 we are going to be taken now to a london police station from there my mum can get her head together and get her thoughts together
318369 there are british passport holders who live in the uk who are being found in places like kandahar

318376 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
318377 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
318378 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
318379 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
318380 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
318381 if these latest revelations are true this is a huge embarrassment to the foreign secretary after the assurances he previously gave to parliament
318382 the us and the uk must at last come clean about the scope of extraordinary rendition and secret detention a violation of american and british law human rights standards and the rules and regulations of nato
318383 both congress and parliament must set the record straight about what happened at diego garcia phr knows from our twenty one year history of documenting torture around the world that secret detention opens the floodgates to torture and other gross human rights abuses
318384 the bush administrations detainee treatment and interrogation policies have damaged our nations reputation as human rights leader
318385 seven years of secrets whispered in secret rooms must give way to on the record testimony and open hearings
318386 the security service did not look too hard at what was going on
318387 our intelligence and counter terrorism relationship with the us is vital to the national security of the united kingdom
318388 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
318389 todays time story further demonstrates that the british government has allowed itself to be duped by the us on a colossal scale while ministers have spent years looking the other way british territory has been used for kidnapping extraordinary rendition illegal imprisonment and possibly torture however ignorance is no excuse when it comes to crimes of this magnitude
318390 the united states must come clean about the existence of its secret prison on diego garcia and the british government must ensure the us does so in february 2008 gen michael hayden the director of the cia stated categorically that diego garcia had never housed a secret prison 3 it now seems that simply isnt true it is time for these evasions to come to an end and for the full details of the cias secret prison system to be revealed
318391 diego garcia is an obvious place for a secret facility
318392 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
318393 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
318394 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
318395 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
318396 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
318397 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
318398 the us may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the us has long denied
318399 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
318400 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the us did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
318401 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
318402 a us plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the us facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the us government has assured us that no us detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
318403 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
318404 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which us intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
318405 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the us and accepted implausible us assurances at face value
318406 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its us allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
318407 it is deplorable that previous us assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of us activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia
318408 responsible for the 9 11 operation from a to z
318409 diego garcia is an obvious place for a secret facility they want somewhere thats difficult to escape from difficult to attack not visible to prying eyes and where a lot of other activity is going on diego garcia is ideal
318410 when i heard about the law lords ruling that was the first time in six years that i actually cried
318411 id pretty much managed to keep it together all these years but when i saw my girlfriend and mother crying i just couldnt any more
318412 i genuinely believe that we are the 51st state you see it everywhere you go not just our foreign policy but in our schools our hospitals and now our courts the british government simply bends over backwards for america
318413 it was more like probing snooping around and leaving messages what hackers call hactivism attack suggests some sort of malicious intent which there simply wasnt
318414 its a classic case of america using a sledgehammer to crack a nut
318415 there was a british hacker like me in the 1990s called matthew bevan and america labelled him the greatest threat to national security since adolf hitler i think they were hugely embarrassed that i got in i remember one reporter in the states telling me that the only major damage i had done was to egos of the top military brass
318416 i think about what i did every day if only i could build a time machine i would when i look back at my hacking days i was a completely different person i hardly slept washed or changed my clothes
318417 seeing what this has done to my family is the hardest part
318418 like any woman lucy wants to settle down and have kids but we can hardly do that with the threat of prison hanging over me
318419 i think if it came down to it and i had to spend time in a us jail i would survive but it would be really tough all the time you hear about the rapes and beatings just the other month i read an amnesty international report about how prison guards were using their stuns guns too much as someone accused of supposedly attacking their country i cant imagine id be too welcome either
318420 in both cases a us plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the us facility in diego garcia
318421 the detainees did not leave the plane and the us government have assured us that no us detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
318422 us investigations show no record of any other rendition through diego garcia or any other overseas territory or through the uk itself since then
318423 the official a frequent participant in white house situation room meetings after september 11 who has since left government says a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being held and interrogated on the island
318424 according to this account the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
318425 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
318426 given everything we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the us did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
318427 our intelligence and counter terrorism relationship with the us is vital to the national security of the united kingdom
318428 we accept us assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the uk or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the us authorities
318429 todays time story further demonstrates that the british government has allowed itself to be duped by the us on a colossal scale
318430 while ministers have spent years looking the other way british territory has been used for kidnapping extraordinary rendition illegal imprisonment and possibly torture
318431 however ignorance is no excuse when it comes to crimes of this magnitude
318432 this program has helped us to take potential mass murderers off the streets before they have a chance to kill
318433 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
318434 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
318435 is a violation of u k law as well as of the bilateral agreement governing the island
318436 our intelligence and counterterrorism relationship with the u s is vital to the national security of the united kingdom we accept u s assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the u k or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the u s authorities
318437 neither of those individuals was ever part of cias high value terrorist interrogation program
318438 i think its important the british government makes plain its deep concern that its not being told the truth and that our territories are being used for these purposes
318439 i would have interviewed the guards on tango block to determine the exact level of hamdans sleep deprivation
318440 the government is in a poor position to get indignant about anything
318441 did somebody at that time tell you something of significance about the accused
318442 while it continued to progress its inquiries it did not have information to indicate dr haneef had any involvement in or foreknowledge of the uk terror acts
318443 to indicate that dr haneef was undertaking planning for a terrorist attack in australia or overseas
318444 did not have sufficient grounds to issue an adverse security assessment
318445 expressed a clear view that they did not believe that all relevant elements of the proposed charge could be proven at that time
318446 i was as surprised as anyone when the dpp advised that haneef could be charged because i didnt think the evidence was strong enough
318447 the inquiry will have to resolve the conundrum as to how dr haneef was charged when the agency which charged him the afp and the agency which provided it with legal advice the dpp both thought there was insufficient evidence
318448 after a short period of conversation in english it became clear to me that the dvd was showing porn it was playing at the loudest possible volume thereafter for the next month the porn movies were played all night
318449 it was very humiliating for me to be treated in this way by the british army if they expected me to give in to my basic instincts they did not realise that i am not that kind of man i was determined not be sexually aroused by this but it made me physically sick
318450 i was spun about for between 15 30 minutes to disorientate me
318451 the use of sensory bombardment and in particular the pornographic films to attempt to break down this male muslim shows that the uk were doing exactly the same as the us using coercive interrogation techniques developed in the 1960s and especially in northern ireland and then refined to fit the so called war on terror
318452 why do i need to give you my e mail address
318453 an essential preparatory step in the plan to bring death and destruction to the heart of the uk
318454 he did what all of our guards do and kept walking
318455 not to transfer detainees from guantanamo to countries where we have determined it is more likely than not they will be tortured
318456 has expended a lot of hours and a lot of travel time and a lot of meeting time to try to reach an agreement with countries
318457 prosecution and defense closing arguments in us versus hamdan are now scheduled for monday morning
318458 he was not with the ideology of osama bin laden and people like him he was only searching for pleasure and money in this life
318459 siddiqui and her three children were picked up from their gulshan e iqbal residence in karachi by the personnel of the intelligence agencies of pakistan and the federal bureau of investigation of the unite states
318460 the whereabouts of her children also is still unknown which is a serious act of negligence on the part of the pakistan government with regard to its responsibility to protect the citizen of the country siddiqui was picked up by pakistani intelligence agencies while on her way to the airport and initial reports suggested that she was handed over to the american fbi a few days later the american news channel nbc reported that siddiqui had been arrested in pakistan on suspicion of facilitating money transfers for terror networks of osama bin laden
318461 you will be astonished to know about the activities of dr aafia siddiqui
318462 we know that you are connected to higher ups but do not make an issue out of your daughters disappearance
318463 he did not play any role he was not a soldier he was a driver
318464 his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
318465 as the american army we have drivers cooks crewmen and legal personal
318466 we also are human beings we have interests in life our people have wives and children and schools you can not understand terrorism and al qaeda from 9 11 operation
318467 one of the reasons for the success of the outside operations is the secrecy of the operations
318468 so many of bin ladens inner circles have no knowledge of what he was planning and so many of members and even the trainers at the military camps do not have any knowledge of the works of the outside cells that includes the civilian employees
318469 he was a driver and auto mechanic he was not at all a military man
318470 he is fit to change trucks tires change oil filters wash and clean cars and fasten cargo in pick up trucks
318471 i was personally responsible for transporting and getting out all families from afghanistan to pakistan

318475 one of my favorite things about fall is the decorations im always so anxious to pull them out of the boxes in the closet and beautify our home with the colors of the season each year i enjoy collecting a few new additions included in this years findings are an adorable felt bag to fill with a chocolate stash a handsome pumpkin guy to sit on our hallway bench and my absolute favorite a beautiful rustic mirrored door stand
318476 they really do like each other there was no love lost between these two when erica drenched lera with her bottled water and then preceded to drag her by her legs into the creek its always fun to see what new rowdy messes can be made during a weekend spent at the cabin
318477 the switch to dtv could leave our most vulnerable citizens without access to critical news weather and public safety information with less than seven months until the transition the federal government has not done nearly enough to facilitate this process for seniors low income families and other vulnerable communities i urge the president to quickly develop a comprehensive plan and commit the resources necessary to help make the transition as smooth as possible

318522 so we were were able to discover who they were at least myspace was our concern is that theres other people who are registered sex offenders that probably have myspace accounts that theres no way if they use an alias that were going to discover
318523 we noticed that the victims came from all over the world and we wanted to present a remembrance that counted as many feelings as possible
318524 the goal was to create a sacred space for the whole community

318532 the genographic project a landmark five year study conducted by ibm and national geographic explores the roots of humanity in the space of just a few thousand generations the linguistic cultural and genetic diversity of the human race has exploded scientists agree that all humans share a common ancestry in africa much less well understood is how the human race migrated out of africa and became so diverse

318551 that we will continue to use carbon fuels for most of our energy needs this is unlikely and even if we continue to use gasoline for most transportation needs the assumption that public transportation will save a lot of energy is unfounded
318552 because buses get such low gas mileage and carry so few people
318553 there has been an ever greater desire to find the most efficient way of getting directly from any given place x to place y this has given the automobile a tremendous edge over mass transit

318662 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
318663 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
318664 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
318665 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
318666 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
318667 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
318668 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact

318737 our film is based on what the city went through in that period how suddenly the gangsters ruled the streets and people were terrified though it is a gangster movie it will also show the contemporary cabaret culture of the city
318738 since the film is about gangsters and the underworld of the 70s we have drawn instances from the lives of gang lords of those days like haji mastan karim lala and vardarajan they were instrumental in bringing organised crime to the city

318761 we have not seen local e discovery competitors emerge overseas

318770 i have serious problems about ranking law schools and the methodology but its a fact of life
318771 not participating not only wouldnt accomplish getting rid of the rankings it could be worse than it is now
318772 as long as they tell us that we need to do that we dont have a hell of a lot of choice
318773 i think it has a real effect if the deans dont participate
318774 i have repeatedly asked judges and lawyers in new york and los angeles if they have ever had their view solicited by u s news
318775 i have yet to meet one person who received a ranking form
318776 i didnt want to work at any of those sweatshops anyway i was just going to work for the summer to pay off some debt i hear those places are miserable
318777 i cant believe lisa is interviewing with another big law firm she has already interviewed with five of them jeez save some for the rest of us
318778 i cant believe billy is selling out i thought he had a stronger moral compass and was going to represent the downtrodden against the man
318779 one of them actually told me to marry a rich doctor
318780 had i known it would be like this i wouldnt have gone to college in the first place
318781 a potent legal weapon in barring medical professional corporations illegally owned and controlled by lay persons from collecting any no fault billings
318782 using this case to create a legal precedent that will permit it to refuse payment to countless new york doctors and medical practices who provide legitimate health care services
318783 fewer doctors may be willing to provide medical services to car accident victims under the new york no fault law and regulations
318784 a popcorn concession at yankee stadium a lot more valuable than one on a street corner
318785 a normal businessman who paid his bills rather than himself then the insurance companies stopped paying claims
318786 did not charge the jury with respect to either intent or scienter
318787 we think the 2nd department will adopt a different standard and we expect to retry the case

318793 they can be any personality type they can be involved in church and boyscouts and still be serial killers
318794 they compartmentalize the emotions but nobody knows how they do that theres been some research that indicates theyre psychopaths who may have actually greater emotional reactivity but they supress it right away maybe before theyre even aware of it
318795 the violence and sexual thrill are somehow intertwined in the attackers mind
318796 theyre probably charged up the whole time whereas with serial killers it can come and go
318797 972 there is no 972 zipcode in the united states but it

318800 that many i dont know which one i should pick
318801 a few months ago i wrote that john mccain was an honorable man and he would run an honorable campaign i was wrong
318802 you know i was once one of those voters who wanted to have a beer with george bush this was before i figured out hed never want to have a beer with someone like me even if he did drink itd be with his rich cronies and after katrina and the war i decided maybe its better to have a president whos competent than one whos beer worthy
318803 well exactly it seemed like such a good reason to vote for someone
318804 you know i was once one of those voters who wanted to do coke with barack obama this was before i figured out hed never want to do lines with someone like me even if he did still do coke itd be in secret not with people in the wrong part of greenwich village and after the economy collapsed and iraq fell to iran i decided maybe its better to have a president whos competent than one whos coke worthy
318805 yes indeed thats most certainly true but we believed the media we thought he had americas best interests at heart heck we even liked the wife but who knew
318806 well exactly it seemed like such a good reason to vote for someone
318807 people are moving online and there are going to be more questions raised about how moving things online subjects people to copyright
318808 the internet works through copying things thats just how digital technology works
318809 copyright law used to be this obscure thing that only publishers were interested in
318810 its something that now affects everyone when you change copyright law now it affects everybody who owns a pc
318811 there are two cultures the web and the real world and whenever cyberspace comes up against the real world it finds that the real world has a different set of rules
318812 the idea of scrabble the idea that you would get points for spelling words cant be copyrighted
318813 the only thing you can copyright is the look and the feel of the game
318814 hasbro was on very solid ground i dont think there was any question about it
318815 thanks to this new electronic lounge called facebook board games are hot two indian students pointed hasbro to what could be their itunes and they responded with lawyers
318816 i call on the state government to uphold the inherent social justice philosophy of the labor party and purchase homes from those people in our community who are suffering with this burden financially and mentally
318817 this matter is not about economics it is about humanity
318818 people in this community rightfully feel let down by their own government
318819 these are hard working australians who have paid taxes all their working lives are they now to be abandoned by their own government
318820 this community is hurting and we must all work together to ease peoples pain and concerns
318821 then when the market recovers they can sell on the open market to recoup costs and turn a profit in addition to rental income
318822 es una mala se al ch vez no quiere inversionista ese es el mensaje
318823 el estado tiene ahorita la forma de pagar por estas compras pero qu pasa el d a que estas empresas empiezan a dar p rdidas y que el estado no tiene como pagar y necesita el dinero para otras cosas esto deteriora los pa ses
318824 invit a los representantes del grupo santander a abrir las negociaciones
318825 vamos a recuperar el banco de venezuela para ponerlo al servicio de los venezolanos de toda la econom a venezolana nos hace mucha falta un banco de esa magnitud
318826 sobre la cl usula de salvaguarda con la que chocaron las negociaciones
318827 hay que salvar este obst culo t cnico contra el que chocamos
318828 parece pr cticamente imposible concluir las negociaciones antes de finales de a o la idea es continuar avanzando para poder presentar un paquete terminado a la nueva administraci n estadounidense as como a india despu s de las elecciones
318829 la renovaci n la densificaci n y la ampliaci n

318831 durante el ltimo a o los hispanos han perdido puestos de trabajo a m s velocidad que cualquier otro grupo
318832 es por eso que el panorama es a n muy gris para ellos

318835 a menos que se tomen medidas extraordinarias y efectivas los negocios hispanos continuar n padeciendo los efectos de una econom a d bil
318836 not only is the federal interest insubstantial but federal jurisdiction over this state law malpractice claim would upend the balance between federal and state judicial responsibilities
318837 we obviously felt that the federal district court had jurisdiction over this matter
318838 we are reviewing the courts opinion and considering our next steps
318839 i dont know of anything that has happened that has gotten our members more concerned
318840 this is as difficult and as complicated technically and legally as anything in environmental law
318841 the superior court judge just with only a limited amount of information and a limited understanding reversed all the hard work by the alj and all the determinations of the agency
318842 we feel very strongly that the judge attempted to legislate or make policy from the bench
318843 so in some sense i dont understand why everybody is getting so hysterical about this
318844 its not like facilities would be stopped in their tracks from constructing here they just have to control it to the best of our ability right now over time the controls get better and better and better
318845 in trying to deal with a source thats going to emit millions of tons of co2 the focus is on that
318846 were not trying to get down to the level of a schoolhouse right now and address that problem so i think we need to keep our eye on the ball here
318847 substantial assistance to law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of another person who committed an offense
318848 purtich was in the prime years of his career as a lawyer when as a result of his offense conduct he largely destroyed the professional success he had achieved
318849 of course purtichs role as intermediary in the milberg weiss kickback scheme was also quite serious
318850 with regard to the defendants sentenced to date melvyn weiss william lerach and seymour lazar none of them cooperated with the governments investigation or prosecution each are clearly deserving of much harsher sentences than purtich because of their central roles in the kickback scheme including their obstruction of the courts
318851 there were many many derogatory things said about andrew cuomo and the people working with him and that he wasnt trusted that there was a sense that you know he wanted to be governor some day and wanted to destroy eliot spitzer
318852 i do recall andrew cuomo being described as an animal
318853 well it was you know it is so to speak was papering the file a gesture
318854 they cuomo investigators had indicated to us that you know any time you have inconsistent testimony there is always the potential for perjury or a perjury charge as opposed to just you know innocent differences of recollection
318855 we were specifically told that the attorney generals office was not doing a perjury investigation but i believe there may have been some discussion of you know the practical foibles of going in and testifying
318856 we wanted to know what the report was going to say sum and substance including our cooperation
318857 they wanted us to say positive things about the report including saying that it was fair and accurate i guess is the best way to describe it
318858 i want to thank the attorney generals office and the state inspector generals office for their efforts and for issuing an expeditious thorough professional and fair report
318859 to give the parties a chance to tell us if there are any inaccuracies and to avoid unfair surprise
318860 neither gov spitzers staff nor sen brunos staff both of whom were briefed indicated that there were any inaccuracies in the report
318861 indeed one year later it is clear that the findings in the attorney generals report were factually accurate and fair in tone
318862 not surprising that the governor stated the report was fair and accurate
318863 we knew that that report was at a minimum terribly incomplete and based upon an incomplete record
318864 those giving into laminacks appetite secured job security raises bonuses and promotions
318865 during and after working hours both on and off the premises and with the actual knowledge of his peers and superiors he used and continues to use his position of power and authority over vulnerable economically dependent and emotionally vulnerable subordinates to seduce or compel as circumstances might warrant intimate sexual relations of a conventional as well as deviate nature
318866 adopted the expedient practice of enabling laminacks tastes by handsomely compensating injured employees in exchange for their perpetual silence
318867 unlawful scheme to defraud thousands of fen phen litigation clients
318868 told her to be quiet and not inform anyone of this
318869 that allegation makes absolutely no sense because under oquinns contract the oquinn firm pays almost half of the expenses out of his fee so it doesnt really make sense for us to engage in some kind of a scheme to increase the expenses
318870 our effort the entire time we handled these expenses was to keep them as low as possible
318871 interesting to say the least because thats one of the primary reasons she was fired
318872 thats absolutely untrue im saddened that after victimizing her he wants to destroy her reputation im confident the evidence will show who is the victim and who is the wrongdoer
318873 she was very aggressive at seeking employment with us this is after all these alleged incidents of sexual harassment had occurred
318874 so that he would be in a better mood and more receptive to testifying in a manner consistent with the litigation theory of defendant law firms
318875 when all the facts come to light i sure hope the actual facts are reported with the same intensity as the alleged facts contained in the petition
318876 laminacks trysts are well known and an established part of both firms lore
318877 no cause of action under or alleging title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 42 u s c 2000e or chapter 21 of the texas labor code is being asserted at this time against any defendant
318878 now this piece starts off with middle c like this
318879 next time we go fishing no poles lets just grabem
318880 the conduct of federal programs or other programs or operations essential to the interests of our nation
318881 increased information sharing will benefit the department congress and the public as well as the private sector which controls the vast majority of the nations cyber infrastructure
318882 it is my hope that the release of this information will assist in improving security in both the public and private sectors
318883 protection of federal networks and the security of our homeland
318884 on march 20th you announced that rod beckstrom would be the director of the new national cyber security center within dhs
318885 prior to this announcement committee staff had been instructed that the existence of the ncsc was itself classified
318886 multi agency multi year plan to secure the federal governments cyber networks
318887 coordinate and integrate information necessary to help secure u s cyber networks and systems and help foster collaboration among federal cyber groups
318888 single location for all source situational awareness about cyber activity and security status of the u s networks and systems
318889 why was the determination made that the contract will be for a 10 month period
318890 how will the dhs provide appropriate oversight to ensure that the contractors support efforts do not intrude on inherently governmental functions
318891 loudoun county is an anomaly in the sense it has not followed the pattern of pw or herndon
318892 nascar has grown into the fastest growing sport in all of america
318893 we are only behind the nfl as far as television ratings last years event drew over 170 million dollars in one time expenditures here in southern nevada that economic rollover computes somewhere to a billion dollar impact on the local economy so everybody locally gets excited about it because it brings so many people to town the beds gaming tables the shows and the restaurants are full it is just a great weekend not just for las vegas motor speedway but also for southern nevada and the danger has a lot to do with it
318894 i wanted to take it to the next level of fan interactivity and no other sport in the world lets you get this close it literally is being in the locker room this has all turned out better than i expected i love what i see it makes me feel real proud to have everybody coming up and congratulating me they love it it is totally unique this puts us 10 years ahead of anybody else were in vegas and we wanted to be part of what its all about so our new facilities match the citys glamour and excitement now it revolutionizes the sport it makes it more fan friendly 12 000 people this weekend in the neon garage area almost touch the drivers hands watch over their shoulders as they work on their cars and thats important because its what we set out to achieve
318895 our new banking will increase the speed by about 18mph therell be above 200mph in places but the qualifying speed wile about 191mph we have safe walls so we hope no more danger but certainly a lot more entertaining for the fans the turning radius is a little more than any other track although there are pother tracks with bigger banking than atlanta and texas but there will be guys going through those turns going a complete lap without ever lifting their foot off the accelerator on the straight aways therell be getting above 200mph we have the worlds best drivers for our vegas racing weekend
318896 were tickled to death its turned out more spectacular state of the art and ahead of every other track in the world its the most dazzling makeover anywhere and in time for our 10th anniversary the entire project we hd no idea it would be as nice as it is brutons vision has been totally manifested the fans now get something here unlike anything else in the world the race fan always comes first lets give the fan to get close to the heroes of the sport while they are going about their business the race fan is so close to the stars as they work live and in person a few feet away theyll be able to peer right into see jeff gordon dale earnhardt jr kyle busch going about their business itll take some getting used to by the teams with the fans literally looking over their shoulders while they are tightening the engine parts fans will be able to come into the garage and look down at the cars as a surgeons class would be able to look down at an operation they will be able to see jeff gordon come out and talk to his crew chief about what needs to be done to the race car and watch the race team work on the race car it is going to bring a whole new element to las vegas we will have created the most wonderful sports facility center anywhere and well do it in the greatest city anywhere
318897 speeds will increase but were actually looking for the increased competition
318898 when the drivers are happy the fans are unhappy when the drivers are unhappy the fans are having a great time and theyre sure going to have a better time in las vegas from now on
318899 we have tremendous sight lines at las vegas motor speedway wonderful backdrop mountains on the eastside of lv and off in the distance the las vegas strip you have the fan from small town usa that comes here to watch nascar and returns to the strip to downtown and gets to enjoy all that las vegas has to offer whether it is a show the gaming or the great restaurants that we have it has got to be the number one attraction in all motor sports to come to las vegas for nascar weekend there is no better place no other city to get this
318900 lance burton in unbelievable he did amazing tricks for us right in front of our eyes i was speechless when he even made murphy disappear right beside me nobodys ever been able to do that
318901 in the printed edition of vegas magazine brittany also talks about her new movie black water transit where she claims she wears nothing the entire time and has sex with everyone
318902 about five minutes into the show he whispered in my ear this would be great in las vegas he liked the show he laughed and he sang along and he enjoyed it and at the end he said it reminded him very much of the 60s when he went into broadway and he had gone to see nichols and may those are my two collective heroes and the reason i went into python this musical is of course lovingly ripped off from the movie monty python and the holy grail which was made in 1975 for about 400 000 on the musical that is less than the lawyers cost but to come to the stage it needed quite a bit of changing we did about 17 drafts over 4 years but it made its money back after six months on broadway it was the big winner in london and we have a touring company that is really doing well everywhere
318903 i thought it was an extraordinary show and i thought it was so funny i had not laughed as hard at a broadway musical since the first time i saw noises off back in the 80s i described spamalot as the show that if you laugh too long you miss the next joke it just doesnt stop and that is why i wanted to do it i wasnt thinking about vegas and lo and behold they said we are opening up in vegas and they asked if i would be in it i thought what a dream when my wife and i were in new york i went to see every other show because i really wanted to see what else was out there i circled two roles and i said to my wife i have got to do these roles one was the lead in dirty rotten scoundrels which closed before i got a hold of it and the other was the king in spamalot so it is easy to hop over to the executive airport and go home in la in just 45 minutes this has been an extraordinary thing and ill be full time through the summer here in vegas but then i go back in september and film we are shooting family feud again ill also be doing a new nbc show and believe it or not theres even a new one too but i cant talk about that one yet so in some cases i will be leaving vegas at midnight flying back to shoot the next day and then flying back here to do the spamalot show again that same night these are the gravy years this is the time you do the things to give you greater freedom later in life so while the opportunities are there i am going to embrace them
318904 much has been written that maybe las vegas is not the place for comedy and musical theater the people come here from the midwest and around the world and they want spectacle they want big exciting things and maybe the musical theater isnt right for vegas over a period of years we have learned from the press and so we said why not face the inevitable and lets end it so we looked for the perfect piece of material to put a final chapter of theater into las vegas
318905 there is a reality to these hotels in vegas there is a certain amount of space and there are certain things you can do we said well if we could do spamalot in the grail theater where avenue q was we would be able to preserve our convention and meeting space instead of building a third theater i must confess that i am ashamed of myself that i did it because of the money and the planning the decision was taken to abbreviate the stay of q we wanted to bring to this city something that hasnt really been done before we believe that vegas is a rich and mature enough community to also exploit wit and this theater was built to be that place in this city where humor and wit prevail i said to eric the night i went to spamalot for the first time this is the easiest entertainment decision i have made in 40 years las vegas would understand it and they would love it we are committed to the show for as long as the public likes it
318906 only a couple of songs went all for one which we needed because we had a costume change for all the girls to get ready for the spamalot number
318907 i was very nervous about opening in london i wasnt sure which way they would jump
318908 i dont think we have added more vegas elements to it just because we are in vegas i realized that we couldnt improve or change the show because its so big and gross and over the top already we can only stay true to what we already do well that is part of the charm of it i am sure our vegas audiences will laugh like theyve never laughed before i find for me that it is more fun to work on python that anything else i tried to do a live reunion here in 1988 and we got very close we got an offer dates a hotel and then michael palin at the last minute said no he didnt want to do it it is scary to go back into the world of silliness but its essential to keep challenging yourself now though i dont think it will ever happen and thats why spamalot is so alive and well and keeping python alive and well too
318909 the material is wacky and absurd irreverent and politically incorrect which is how you would describe las vegas actually
318910 hey i can still get down and throw down and im not about to retire
318911 this is the show i should have done twenty years ago this is the dream come true
318912 the spirit of the great crooner is back in town
318913 are you lonesome tonight that elvis song and i pinspot barry and i said
318914 vegas will be the best speedway complex in the world this week
318915 las vegas is the entertainment capital of the world so we have to be the biggest and best
318916 its a perspective on the sport of auto racing that has never been available to race fans before call it adding the entertainment element race fans get the opportunity to see their favorite drivers up close and that strong relation ship is really alive and well at lvms
318917 segunda noche de danza rabe en bailando por un sue o 2008
318918 covered both social issues and business issues relating to the ongoing situation in seattle
318919 would go to the hassle and expense of continuing to pursue this case
318920 i explained to him that such a promise could not be made because those were issues for future deliberations of committees of the nba board of governors and the board itself
318921 at no time during the conversation did i threaten mr schultz in any way either expressly or implicitly regarding his continuation of this lawsuit or any other matter
318922 the fact is that any increase in the costs incurred by bcos is a direct result of bcoss decision to pursue this lawsuit in the face of a release that clearly implicates the interests of the nba
318923 it is not the result of the nbas perfectly reasonable and entirely predictable request to intervene to protect its interests
318924 i had it for about a month or so just constantly changing
318925 my focus is on the minnesota vikings and im trying to get better im not with the chiefs anymore people want to build up the animosity people know what the beef was for me right now im focusing on where ive got to be to help my team and this organization win football games thats all i care about and me being there might have taken away from that so coach made the decision to give me the day off and i took it and my body feels great for it
318926 its been a lot of work these last couple of weeks for myself
318927 its a little different i tell those young guys i said man i havent worked this much since i was a starter and i dont see my name at the front of that depth chart right now its a little different you come out there the day after a night like last night which was pretty much a scrimmage its taken a toll on us hopefully we get those guys back out there
318928 were looking at the route depths from wide receivers and trying to time up the play perfectly
318929 for the quarterback its about reading the coverage and progressing through reads correctly you should throw for a high percentage
318930 its about everybody getting to where theyre supposed to be and not making any mental mistakes
318931 we want guys to get to their spots whether were in zone or man were looking for guys to run to the football and tag the ballcarrier were also looking for turnovers and tipped balls
318932 it means the new team is starting to move forward and get serious about value creation and not flag planting it underlines the latent value of the business
318933 if we could value the rest of the business as we have just done then we would be around 2 50 a share instead of about 1 20p a share currently
318934 we identified it as one of our lower return businesses and harder to grow we could not see a way of getting round it
318935 there is a lot of growth opportunity in eastern europe such as poland and russia and we will look at other opportunities in eastern europe we have a lot of work to do to fix china which the other big opportunity
318936 this news a very reasonable price in difficult markets allowing kingfisher to exit a non core market and reduce its actual debt levels should be regarded as positive albeit not entirely unexpected
318937 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
318938 prison staff are genuinely worried for blake and amys management are happy because they feel she needs to move out of town
318939 there was nothing in the world that could set him off or make him do anything wrong to anybody
318940 as far as ive known him hed never got into a single fight in his whole life
318941 its early and i think the judge just wants to respect his rights to speak to counsel and hes giving him that opportunity
318942 i dont think it will be very long that theyll allow him to do that be without a lawyer
318943 he was just such an amazing guy he had a great personality
318944 he never cared for sitting around unless it was for a weekend with the guys playing risk he was always big on travelling he didnt like to sit in one place
318945 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
318946 that bill subversive sharp watch out for him misses nothing a dots connector
318947 cuil may be powered by past googlers but that still does not justify it doing well not all start ups are as privileged as friend feed
318948 standby counsel if required to conduct voir dire for mr duncan would be effectively eroding mr duncans right to self representation while simultaneously providing ineffective representation
318949 neither standby counsel nor this court should ask mr duncan to permit this trial role by standby counsel
318950 standby counsel if required to conduct voir dire for mr duncan would be effectively eroding mr duncans right to self representation while simultaneously providing ineffective representation
318951 neither standby counsel nor this court should ask mr duncan to permit this trial role by standby counsel
318952 hes been working at it and hes getting better but hes still a long way from being that shortstop that can go to his left and to his right
318953 basically we talked to him about this yesterday and he was resistant to it based on the fact that he was getting better and he felt that he could help the ball club
318954 even though he may be able to play in 12 days instead of 15 i think we can take this luxury now that we have manny and weve got a little more bench strength hes just taking one for the team basically
318955 whatever happened in boston is in the past im excited man i cant wait i feel like i took 5 000 pounds off my back
318956 its just a new chapter in my life im happy to be here thats all i can say las a great city im happy to be a dodger
318957 i want to say something from the bottom of my heart

318969 im just going to play hard well see what happens
318970 jack nicklaus isnt here so i guess thats a substitute
318971 because it would be pretty scary if it got a little panicky and some spectator or some of the golfers were too close that wouldnt have been an issue if a caddie had gotten too close
318972 the usga put some pin placements on us today that almost defy the imagination
318973 its just treacherous treacherous greens out there with some unbelievable pin placements
318974 im not going to comment about the golf course the usga should know better

318980 all men are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality
318981 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it

318990 los rumores que surgieron en inglaterra acerca de su salud son dram ticos sobredimensionados y falsos su visita es preventiva
318991 sabemos que todos los rivales son importantes pero tambi n es cierto que cruz azul es uno de los de m s trascendencia en el futbol mexicano seguro que ser un partido abierto din mico con mucha ida y vuelta y donde el que aproveche mejor las oportunidades se va a llevar los tres puntos
318992 vi parte del duelo de cruz azul de la semana pasada y es un equipo que juega bien que es r pido y que tiene grandes individualidades que pueden marcar la diferencia adem s es un equipo que intenta atacar pr cticamente todo el partido
318993 uno siempre busca anotar y marcar diferencia en los partidos yo espero volver a encontrar un gol pero primero est apoyar al grupo para ganar y sumar los tres puntos
318994 este atlas est demostrando cosas buenas tuvo un arranque espectacular y creo que tambi n los rivales se deben preocupar un poco por nosotros
318995 nosotros debemos salir concentrados en hacer bien nuestro trabajo e intentar ganar porque los tres puntos son importantes y porque estamos en nuestra casa y eso hay que aprovecharlo al m ximo
318996 santander indica que el monto de la comisi n a n despu s del aumento es similar al que cobran otras instituciones es de llamar la atenci n de este instituto central que instituciones que forman parte de un mercado competitivo eleven sus comisiones a los niveles de precios m s altos
318997 es preciso este tipo de estrategias con las cuales el banco de m xico no est de acuerdo en virtud de que constituyen barreras a la movilidad de los usuarios lo que impide que stos obtengan los beneficios de contar con una red de cajeros integrada y un sistema financiero eficiente
318998 banco de m xico no considera conveniente que instituciones que operan en un mercado competitivo establezcan sus comisiones a los niveles de precios m s altos cuando la competencia debe tener el resultado opuesto es decir que los precios se reduzcan a los niveles que ofrecen sus competidores con menores precios
318999 particularmente el pago de deuda la mayor a de las entidades del pa s desde el sexenio pasado han utilizado parte de los recursos de excedentes en el pago de sus deudas
319000 para recuperar el nivel de producci n y sobre todo para aprovechar la potencial explotaci n de crudo en aguas profundas
319001 hay constancias de que existen yacimientos en esa zona tenemos las pruebas de que empresas estadounidenses se disponen a hacer perforaciones y explotar el crudo
319002 adem s pemex ya hizo exploraci n afirm el legislador y adem s se perfor y explot lamentablemente s lo se obtuvo en ese pozo un crudo muy pesado pero diferentes estudios permiten contar con seguridad en resultados en la zona sin embargo y es aqu donde radica la necesidad de mayores inversiones incluso cabe la posibilidad de hacer acuerdos con empresas nacionales de noruega y brasil
319003 afortunadamente ya hay una plataforma de entendimiento con la oposici n hay confianza en que se obtendr una propuesta que abarque la mayor a de las posiciones expuestas en las tres propuestas de reforma al menos el 80 del conjunto
319004 we believe he was in the woods and near our officers who were also in the woods all night
319005 its not that the message is not out there were still trying to figure out why the african american community is not taking advantage of preventive methods
319006 a lot of people have the mindset that it will never happen to me that its not real unless it happens to you

319009 a sad day for alaska and for the senator after his 40 years of service to our state the people of alaska are resilient and strong
319010 i have great faith in our state and our people and we will continue to move forward
319011 knowingly and willfully engaged in a scheme to conceal a material fact that is his continuing receipt of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of things of value from a private corporation and its chief executive officer by among other things failing to report them as was required on stevens required yearly financial disclosure forms
319012 i have proudly served this nation and alaska for over 50 years
319013 it saddens me to learn that these charges have been brought against me i have never knowingly submitted a false disclosure form require by law as a u s senator
319014 our office has been flooded today with calls and e mails from supporters urging the senator to press on
319015 the message from them is clear alaska needs ted stevens in the u s senate
319016 news such as this rocks the foundation of our state
319017 the state senate is poised to make history this week as it considers approving a license for transcanada to move forward with an alaska gas pipeline
319018 in our legal system a man is presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law
319019 as far as i am concerned ted stevens remains my friend i believe in him
319020 but you know i believe in the america system of justice that hes presumed innocent
319021 i know ted stevens to be an honorable hard working alaskan who has served our state well for as long as we have been a state
319022 as to the charges we are at the beginning of the criminal process and there is a judicial procedure in place that will be followed
319023 one of the most effective and honest legislators i have ever worked with he has worked diligently to serve alaska and has fought to make life better for people in every region of our state i hope people will not rush to judgment and will let the judicial process work the process is based on being innocent until proven guilty
319024 senator stevens should step down from his post in washington its time for him to retire alaskans need representation in the senate that they can trust
319025 they have a special relationship with the alaska native population there is a lot of potential resource development on federal lands and we have a lot of coastline too
319026 we believe this is important not only for us and our bilateral relationship with india but for rest of the world
319027 this is an important day for india and for our civil nuclear initiative for the resumption of indias cooperation with our friends abroad
319028 this important issue will welcome india into the nonproliferation mainstream and assist india in meeting its growing energy needs in an environmentally friendly way
319029 todays agreement represents a major step forward to opening civil nuclear cooperation with india while strengthening the worlds nonproliferation regime
319030 there is serious concern that the united states has taken this step with the intention to create precedence and pave the way for israel to continue its clandestine weapon activities
319031 se necesita llorar bonito risas y haber llorado en la vida real aunque la gente dice que aparento ser muy buena mi marido dice que yo f cilmente podr a ser una excelente villana
319032 por supuesto sobre todo me ha ense ado la impotencia de no poder hacer algo que mejore su vida o mejor dicho de que es muy poco lo que puedes hacer para ayudarles ha sido un aprendizaje duro
319033 no yo siempre he cre do que las telenovelas tienen una funci n entretener su papel es que la gente se olvide de los problemas por un momento
319034 no siento que en el mundo de las telenovelas existen temas hist ricos did cticos de nostalgia y hay otras que son como un cuento de hadas es decir que t te lo crees o no te lo crees pienso que cadenas de amargura es un cuento una historia no creo que tenga un mensaje como tal
319035 yo la vi y me gust adem s curiosamente casi siempre me toca actuar en refritos bueno ahora le dicen remakes todas esas telenovelas las vi cuando era chavita y ya no tan chavita
319036 por eso no creo que me cueste trabajo porque el sentimiento de madre lo he arrastrado en casi todas las novelas obviamente es un personaje nuevo con otra sensibilidad pero todos mis personajes llevan mi experiencia de la vida
319037 ah est la novedad pero conf o mucho en la direcci n de karina duprez quien fue mi maestra en el instituto andr s soler
319038 que la delincuencia organizada se mueve por todo el pa s pero cuando han intentado hacer cosas en jalisco han tenido una respuesta r pida y una respuesta a favor de la ley y de los ciudadanos
319039 revealed operations which did not meet the fdas or actavis standards for good manufacturing practices
319040 did gene and i hate each other yes did we love each other yes
319041 herzog and a few other directors keep the movies vibrating for me not every movie needs to vibrate but unless a few do the thrill is gone
319042 the value of a motion picture is indicated by the rotation of a chubby thumb through 180 degrees
319043 its unfair he has a car already boo hoo hoosince he won it thats part of the game be happy for the guy use that to your advantage made him a deal
319044 theres a breeze that makes my breathing not so easy
319045 it wont drop the price now so why do it

319047 consumer confidence was at a 2 1 2 yr high
319048 the cost of regular gasoline has soared to over 4 a gallon
319049 they are claiming we need change and are blaming the republicans for everything
319050 although this democrat majority just adjourned for the democrat 5 week vacation house republicans are continuing to fight on the house floor although the lights mics and c span cameras have been turned off house republicans are on the floor speaking to the tax payers in the gallery who not surprisingly agree with republican energy proposals all republicans who are in town are encouraged to come to the house floor
319051 i am a democrat and here is my energy plan
319052 but c span which has no control over the cameras in the chamber has stopped broadcasting the house floor meaning no one is witnessing this except the assembled republicans their aides and one democrat rep dennis kucinich d ohio who has now left
319053 also republicans can thank shadegg for turning on the microphones the first time apparently the fiesty arizona conservative started typing random codes into the chambers public address system and accidentally typed the correct code allowing republicans brief access to the microphone before it was turned off again
319054 update 6 rep devin nunes r calif just pretended to be a democrat he stood on the other side of the chaber and listed all of the gop bills that the dems killed
319055 i am a democrat and here is my energy plan
319056 the dems are afraid to put it to a vote because they dont want to be on record opposing what would without a doubt lead to lower gas prices
319057 rep devin nunes r calif just pretended to be a democrat he stood on the other side of the chamber and listed all of the gop bills that the dems killed he then said i am a democrat and here is my energy plan
319058 the democrats did it back in 1995 when the republicans were in control democrats placed a big photo in the speakers chair of then speaker newt gingrich r ga wearing a diaper
319059 let me guess all you guys digging this story up voted for bush twice
319060 jack nicklaus isnt here so i guess thats a substitute
319061 because it would be pretty scary if it got a little panicky and some spectator or some of the golfers were too close that wouldnt have been an issue if a caddie had gotten too close
319062 the usga put some pin placements on us today that almost defy the imagination
319063 its just treacherous treacherous greens out there with some unbelievable pin placements
319064 im not going to comment about the golf course the usga should know better
319065 then i hit my first tee shot on 10 and walking off the tee my neck locked up
319066 whatever happened in boston is in the past im excited man i cant wait i feel like i took 5 000 pounds off my back
319067 its just a new chapter in my life im happy to be here thats all i can say las a great city im happy to be a dodger
319068 i want to say something from the bottom of my heart
319069 i want to thank the fans in boston i love you guys i just want to move on im thinking blue right now im thinking about the dodgers i want people to judge me on what i do here not what i did in boston
319070 im going to start maybe stealing some bases i dont go deep anymore i just hit line drives to right field
319071 can i go and get something to eat get ready for the game
319072 im like a little kid now im kind of nervous
319073 im just going to be manny and play the game
319074 in our hearts it is and in the mexican community it was 66 then it went to 99 in a matter of minutes it was all through the agent scott boras and his staff
319075 ive played a lot against him ill let you know in a month we went through some conversation
319076 clean it up a little bit and make it manageable
319077 ive got to cut it im going to be looking like a baby
319078 i dont want them to treat me different than the other guys if they want me to cut it ill cut it it will grow back
319079 you have to separate the desire to get out of boston and the desire to get out of the situation
319080 im just going to play hard well see what happens
319081 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
319082 ive never wanted to do anything remotely close to doping its never ever crossed my mind ive never been approached about doing it its never been an issue my entire career its the last thing i would ever do
319083 i referred some other contributors from over there to this article here anyway its a very interesting article click the images of the pages to
319084 he was in my fingers my heart each time petal scented air came through my window my emotions were thrown into turmoil
319085 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
319086 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
319087 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
319088 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
319089 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
319090 we are in a period that feels a lot like 1991 and 1992 and we had similar issues with a recession at that point in time high oil prices and fear of oil supply shortages
319091 for the next several months and i would say for the next year the credit situation that customers are facing in dealerships will take center stage
319092 the marketplace is changing rapidly and automakers that are more flexible in their production will fare better
319093 so i think it s pretty obvious that at least they acknowledged that
319094 and that is what campaigns are going to be like that s what every campaign that i have been involved in
319095 the one we know hes not jesus christ oh yeah hes the anti christ if the mainstream media does not call mccain out on this one it will be shameful i too am practically speechless with dismay mccain is obviously in his second childhood but what is the excuse of his staff
319096 mccain is behaving like a child a particularly obtuse rather spoiled child i sincerely hope that people aren t stupid or blind enough to fall for these tactics again
319097 dont lie dont cheat dont steal everything else is fair game
319098 vote for me im old and mean and rich and white
319099 pretty sad when your own 95 year old mom calls your ads
319100 at the time we started it no one else was doing it
319101 there wasnt a lot of reliable information out there about the flu
319102 we thought the contributions ought to be put together by everyone because something as wide ranging as a pandemic involves more than just the health department
319103 if you have to close the schools down in a pandemic parents have to know where to pick up their kids they need to know where they can get food and electricity it goes well beyond the virus itself
319104 one of the things we have accomplished is pushing governmental entities to be more transparent
319105 im not sure there would have even been a pandemicflu gov if it hadnt been for our site
319106 this is the wisdom of crowds everyone gets a chance to look at it if theres false information it needs to be corrected
319107 it was started to share information between associates in cardiology
319108 i didnt intend it to be shared throughout the world but it took on a life of its own
319109 its something that has potential to provide up to date medical information
319110 i have a wall of textbooks but sometimes you need more current information a textbook costs us 300 and by the time it comes out its out of date
319111 medicine has lagged behind other professions in its use of technology
319112 whatever we can do to make things more efficient we should do
319113 i wanted to use the power of a wiki for surgical knowledge
319114 doctors need an online resource that they can access at any time in a hospital in the old days they would rely on books but these get out of date and pages go missing so a wiki provides a great opportunity to close that information gap
319115 they have to submit a cv curriculum vitae of their credentials be approved by the site editors and also confirm their e mail address when an article is posted it can be approved by an editor and this status is shown
319116 simply managing their network they had arbitrarily picked an application and blocked their subscribers access to it
319117 disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable
319118 raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions
319119 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
319120 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
319121 i welcome todays bipartisan effort as an important step in the process of reducing our dangerous dependence on foreign oil
319122 settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered
319123 the parties to any dispute the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security shall first of all seek a solution by negotiation enquiry mediation conciliation arbitration judicial settlement resort to regional agencies or arrangements or other peaceful means of their choice

319135 made to stick why some ideas survive and others die
319136 i wouldnt have any idea this early in the preseason whether thatd be an accurate ranking
319137 i know its something thats not very significant until the end of the year and thats what we talked about with the team
319138 once we hold up that acc trophy everythings going to be fine
319139 my first fall practice my first camp it was a little different than the spring
319140 i think i have to get better and make more adjustments
319141 lets go lets go the ball cant be on the ground
319142 if our guys see it and are hungry and keep the hunger and it creates a sense of urgency then thats good
319143 if they dont work as hard and say weve arrived weve got this ranking and go about business as usual thats not good
319144 police you shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
319145 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
319146 gala muzicii din bacau va fi transmisa de televiziunea romana
319147 i speak to people in the game a lot and they tell me about ajax who in the 1970s won the european cup with an extremely young team and changed the face of the game
319148 people tell me that we are on course to do that but we need that stepping stone of winning something of knowing how to win
319149 before the euros i didnt know how it felt to win but now that i have experienced it i know what it takes you need to have tasted it
319150 look at chelsea they hadnt won anything in many years they got experienced players in won the league and that gave them experience and confidence together and others followed
319151 sometimes that is the key everyone said before last season that we werent even going to finish amongst the top four and we proved them wrong
319152 it would be beautiful he can play as centre forward or in the same role as raul just behind the forwards and also in the two positions in midfield
319153 ill use two different line ups for the two games so that we can keep running for the 90 minutes
319154 the obtuse and acute angles create slipping illusory shapes that make the towering forms look more dynamic and slender

319421 this is a much broader issue that wal mart but i think the battle to engage wal mart and for them to examine their own corporate values and what their policies and approaches are to their workers and how they are going to be good corporate citizens i think is absolutely vital
319422 if costco can do that it means wal mart can do it and if wal mart does it then what were going to see is other companies recognizing that they have some obligations not only to their shareholders but also to their stakeholders and thats workers and communities in which theyre located

319450 mr roves e mails from the white house to the justice department the fbi the pentagon congress and various federal regulatory agencies are obviously relevant to the factual issues that we intend to address in this case
319451 we are concerned about reports that mr rove not only destroyed e mails but also took steps to destroy the hard drives from which they had been sent
319452 we have been confidentially informed by a source we believe to be credible that karl rove has threatened michael connell a principal witness we have identified in our king lincoln case in federal court in columbus ohio that if he does not agree to take the fall for election fraud in ohio his wife heather will be prosecuted for supposed lobby law violations
319453 this appears to be in response to our designation of rove as the principal perpetrator in the ohio corrupt practices act rico claim with respect to which we issued document hold notices last thursday to you and to the us chamber of commerce institute for legal reform

319467 if you want to deploy a force in an environment like that unless you are prepared to suffer a lot of casualties you need a very well equipped force a very strong force
319468 the danger is humiliation is casualties is that if you send a force and you don t make a real difference then people will really turn away from somalia and that would be a real tragedy
319469 social dialogue should be not only interreligious but intra religious as well to achieve peaceful coexistence in the world

319483 for years many nations lacked a formal framework for the concept of civil security
319484 the increased threat of terrorism and regularly occurring natural disasters in the u s and around the world have given a renewed sense of urgency to this topic
319485 it is a historic effort not only in magnitude but also in terms of international support to the united states during wildfires
319486 it cant be an instance where the loudest voice in the room wins because that is not the integration that you are looking for
319487 that will not facilitate the partnership needed during a catastrophe
319488 in my country for example we have a different approach to crisis management and consequence management we have a different perception about these things and also about how to implement and manage these issues
319489 but i came here to learn about western perspectives to hear from western scholars and what they think about specific issues it was very useful for me
319490 we want to focus the course even more on some of the key mission areas of the civil security concept and the lessons learned from specific case studies
319491 we have already received a lot of input from our course participants on case studies that they think we ought to consider for future iterations of the program
319492 now the reality is that conventional and strategic force modernization programs are strongly supported in the services and in the congress
319493 the principal challenge therefore is how to ensure that the capabilities gained and counterinsurgency lessons learned from iraq and afghanistan as well as the lessons we learned from other places where we have engaged in irregular warfare over the last two decades are institutionalized within the defense establishment
319494 looking to the future we need to find a long term place in the base budget for these lessons
319495 i firmly believe that in the years ahead our military is much more likely to engage in asymmetric conflict than conventional conflict against a rising state power
319496 we must be ready for both kinds of conflict and fund the capabilities to do both
319497 there is no doubt in my mind that the modernization programs will continue to have strong institutional and congressional support
319498 i just want to make sure that the capabilities we need for the conflicts were in and most likely to face in the foreseeable future also are sustained long term

319504 in therapy we would usually start with building self esteem in the client so they could ensure that the verbal abuse didnt continue in the relationship or that the victim didnt continue in the relationship
319505 it often takes time for the partners of verbal abusers to realize that the abuser is the one with the problem

319513 he had learned from the day before that it was going to be some type of x isolation route and probably be a comeback

319530 myriad of problems including the failure to adequately fund defense counsel for poor people facing death sentences a decades long appeals process and the risk that innocent people will be sentenced to death
319531 ultimately the report says the people of california must make a choice spend hundreds of millions on reforming the current death penalty drastically narrow the states death penalty or replace the death penalty with permanent imprisonment
319532 im not well versed in contemporary choreography but they invited me to their gala in new york that fall and twylas in the upper room was fresh in my mind when they asked me which choreographer id like to work with
319533 we hung out for an afternoon and said lets do it we got to know each other talking about narrative versus non narrative the pros and cons of each
319534 im not a moviegoer so i hadnt seen his work there
319535 he has a ton of energy he has a lot of range hes very versatile and he had his own rock n roll band who could not love that also he knows his film history and he knows his 20th century classical music history the russians in particular
319536 the music that inspired me in the first place was mostly composed for ballet
319537 i figured ill start and then go play music with twyla and see what she responds to
319538 the first time we hung out listening to a lot of records
319539 she happened to be listening to a scott joplin opera i thought ive never written a rag im going to write her a rag and i knew i was going to use a lot of percussion i wanted to end up with five movements i set myself certain parameters that every movement would borrow from each other i tried to create something where if i had the movements laid out if they were made of glass and i dropped them i would take fragments of each of them and mix them up so that each was borrowing bits from the other
319540 danny had a sense of structure that was symphonic also hes used to action to seeing and then reinforcing so he was ideal from the point of view of supporting action he was very focused a delight to work with he would always take the extra step sending you three versions instead of just two
319541 my only content was a very physical one the difference between a force directed against itself and another person and force directed together outward
319542 it investigated how all rhythm evolves from a single walking step and how any of the metric structures come from that shift of weight right and left
319543 i began to think about right and left to find a sort of duality in the body from that came this feeling of the opposition we all have inside ourselves how we have to work to coordinate that power thats the physical grounding for the scenario of rabbit and rogue those two characters evolved from that the ballet did not evolve in language
319544 even though the material had been shaped on other dancers i could make it my own in terms of the musicality and the intent the dynamic phrasing with this one we went further i spent two weeks mano a mano working with her in the studio in her apartment she gives you a very clear direction to go in but she also lets you play
319545 came through not in a literal or direct way but just atmospherically i start onstage by myself so i set the tone im not a dark force but maybe more mischievous i dont mind creating chaos along the way
319546 i would have done the process over and over again
319547 i cant speak highly enough about her she was just unbelievable to work with the communication the focus she had on us physically and mentally she just homed in on exactly what she wanted she could sense what was going to come out emotionally not just physically if you were frustrated shed like that shed say keep that feeling in there through her choreography the individual comes out
319548 her sense of geometry and symmetry and shaping dynamics in a way thats not what one would think in the broader sense it was so full of surprises
319549 the culture the art world its not a fad of the west thats going to fade away china is a power
319550 i think there are a lot of opportunities to collaborate and partner for a long time ahead
319551 half life of a dream contemporary chinese art from the logan collection
319552 a whole new generation is coming up with a new vision
319553 i do see in this new generation a new kind of art being made
319554 maybe not new to the world but certainly new to china the first wave was political pop more direct and obvious work im seeing a much more introspective emotional psychological sexual type of work people investigating themselves and their identity sun xun is asking identity questions about his country where it came from where its going and the worlds perceptions
319555 has revealed itself to be more psychologically resonant than the facade of pop iconoclasm and gestures of ironic detachment might readily suggest
319556 reenact the psychic aftermath of an era in which representations of specific human emotions were replaced with the idealized faces of the revolution
319557 as the culture changes you see the subject matter changing
319558 when i came back to l a from that trip i was just full of passion and fire
319559 i had to learn the language it was almost frenetic i didnt know why i was doing it i just had to when i came to los angeles 10 years ago i thought it was the wild west now china is the wild west i love it
319560 things are changing at a rapid pace there arent any rules in a way i lived in the 798 complex a former munitions factory converted into a sprawling art center for two months at a friends studio and i kept getting lost because the roads were changing now it looks like soho but if you are a foreigner you are in demand everyone wants to collaborate
319561 the concrete dragon chinas urban revolution and what it means for the world
319562 they were effectively field tested far from the center of power
319563 being a smaller theater you can adapt and do things quickly
319564 i understand they want to protect the actors and thats good but the rules were clearly written in a different era
319565 the less veneer y it looks the better we want musical theater to reach out into the l a community like it hasnt done before and i think this is one way to achieve that
319566 the isolation that happens in a car and how you rewire that into something that can be viewed by many was an interesting concept

319576 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

319621 was actually part of a team that helped the government investigate the anthrax attacks after sept 11
319622 so even if ivins was involved how would a high government official know that a rogue bioweapons scientist was going to go postal with anthrax if that high government official was not himself involved

319668 behavioral scientist sheena iyengar and several colleagues analyzed company sponsored retirement programs for nearly 800 000 workers looking at how the participation rates varied as a function of how many fund choices the organization offered sure enough the researchers found that the more choices that were offered the less likely the employees were to enrol in the program at all for every 10 additional funds the company offered the participation rate dropped 2 by comparison they found that when only two funds were offered the rate of participation was roughly 75 but when fifty nine funds were offered the participation dropped below 60 in a second study they set up a display at an upscale super market in which passersby could sample a variety of jams that were all made by a single manufacturer either 6 or 24 flavors were offered at any given time the results demonstrated a clear and astonishing difference between the two conditions only 3 of those who approached the extensive choice display actually purchased any jam contrast that with the 30 who bought jam when they approached the limited choice display

319732 pak jk nggak bisa menghentikan gejolak di partai golkar setelah sejumlah tokoh nasional maju pada pilpres 2009
319733 kami akan berkongres november bersama sama kongres persatuan istri purnawirawan perin
319734 hal itu tidak didiskusikan tapi nuansanya sudah begitu artinya kalau ada yang secara pribadi sebagai wni ingin maju di politik praktis silakan saja
319735 beliau beliau itu memiliki potensi dan kemampuan untuk beraktivitas di bidang politik ya silakan saja
319736 komitmen ini bukan berarti pepabri melakukan politik praktis tapi ini politik negara yang harus kita sama sama laksanakan agar negara kita tenteram dan kita bisa beraktivitas secara baik
319737 kalau ada laporkan kepada saya nanti akan ditindaklanjuti masing masing kepala staf

319744 saya masuk islam tanggal 27 agustus saya bersyahadat di masjid ceng hoo surabaya dan disaksikan oleh banyak orang
319745 saya berangkat ke sana sendiri untungnya teman saya di piti masjid ceng hoo banyak jadi sudah dipersiapkan bahkan pak ali markus memberikan selamat ketika saya sudah bersyahadat
319746 setahu saya mereka hanya berani mengkritik atau menyindir mereka tidak berani bertanya secara frontal mungkin karena saya saudara tertua jadi mereka segan dengan saya
319747 saya memang senang membaca segala buku agama mulai dari agama budha kong hucu kristen dan islam
319748 dari pembacaan dan perenungan semua intisari agama yang saya serap bahwa semua agama itu benar dan mengajarkan kebaikan namanya juga mualaf amanah cuma penyampaiannya bermacam macam terangnya
319749 saya melihat islam adalah agama terakhir dan ia mengambil dari semua intisari agamayang telah ada sehingga ajaran islam begitu lugas dan mudah diserap secara kaidah
319750 dalam keluarga saya tidak fanatik memeluk satu agama saya dulu agamanya kristen sedangkan saudara saya ada yang budha ada juga yang kong hucu malah istri saya beragama budha
319751 anak saya saya bebaskan dalam memilih agama saya tidak pernah melarang hal itu
319752 saya pernah mencoba memeluk beberapa agama namun islamlah yang membuat saya lebih tenang dan pas dan saya bisa lebih gampang menangkap ajaran islam daripada yang lain
319753 saya mengenal islam lebih banyak setelah andrew menerangkan kepada saya dan keluarga tentang ajaran islam sesungguhnya
319754 saya juga heran padahal ia sejak kecil sudah ada di australia namun ia begitu kuat saat menerangkan tentang bagaimana ajaran islam
319755 ia membandingkan antara ayat per ayat bahkan beberapa dari paman dan bibinya tidak bisa menyela dan menjawab pertanyaan andrew
319756 sejak itu saya jadi tekun belajar islam saya baca al quran yang terjemahan dari bahasa inggris dan tionghoa saya terus mencari apa yang dikatakan andrew
319757 andrew itu untuk percaya dan yakin biasanya sudah melalui penelitian dan perbandingan antara baik dan buruknya
319758 saat saya beritahu saya menjadi muslim ia begitu senang ia menyebut lafal allahu akbar berulang ulang ia begitu senang saya masuk islam
319759 pertama kali saya melaksanakan salat hati saya rasanya tenteram dan damai tidak pernah saya merasakan hal seperti ini sebelumnya meski saya tidak fasih cara melafalkan arabnya namun saya tahu arti bahasa indonesianya
319760 saat shalat hati saya damai sehingga bisa melepas kejenuhan dan stres saat bekerja saya lebih mantap dalam mengerjakan tugas tugas kerja
319761 kalau salatnya sih sudah bisa dipelajari tapi kalau melafalkannya ini saya masih kaku butuh waktu yang banyak
319762 kalau lupa bacaannya bukunya saya baca lalu saya kembalikan lagi lucu pokoknya kalau melihat saya belajar salat
319763 saya berencana mendatangkan guru privat bahasa arab dan saya ingin sekali bisa melafalkan bacaan salat
319764 saat ini pkt juga diminta membantu masyarakat di daerah pemasaran di indonesia
319765 bantuan ini untuk membangun kembali 15 rumah yang hangus akibat musibah kebakaran
319766 jangan dilihat dari sisi besarnya bantuan namun kepedulian kami memang tak bisa diukur dengan uang
319767 bantuan yang sama juga diserahkan di lokasi gempa di kabupaten pesisir selatan sumatra barat yakni di kecamatan lunang silaut tapan linggo saribaganti dan sutera secara keseluruhan bantuan untuk kedua provinsi tersebut sebesar rp 200 juta
319768 di negeri kita ini memang telah banyak orang yang menyandang predikat sarjana namun harus kita akui bahwa masih banyak sarjana kita yang kebingungan mencari kerja pada akhirnya mereka harus menghadapi kenyataan hidup tidak hanya bertumpu pada selembar kertas yang namanya ijazah tapi bagaimana kita mampu menggali potensi untuk mengarungi liku liku kenyataan hidup
319769 semua masih saya kalkulasikan kalau saya pikir baik untuk negara untuk bangsa untuk rakyat ya saya insya allah akan maju tapi kalau justru menurut perhitungan saya tidak baik saya tidak akan maju
319770 ini masih tahun 2007 tidak tepat kalau sekarang ini saya harus menyampaikan saya maju atau tidak karena itu pada akhir masa bakti saya nanti saya akan menyampaikan secara terbuka bisa saja saya berkompetisi kembali bisa saja saya tidak akan mencalonkan diri sebagai presiden
319771 bagus karena itulah demokrasi yang makin mekar karena kalau kita berpikir positif makin banyak calon maka makin banyak pilihan rakyat pada saatnya nanti tentu akan memilih siapa yang menurut mereka tepat untuk memimpin negeri kita pada 2009 mendatang
319772 harus saya hormati harus kita hormati tapi kalau saya diminta memberikan komentar sekarang tidak tepat sutiyoso masih gubernur dki jakarta saya masih presiden
319773 kan tidak etis saya memberikan komentar pada pak sutiyoso yang masih menjabat gubernur tapi pencalonan beliau dalam kerangka demokrasi harus kita hormati
319774 kalau di as sudah sangat ramai kompetisinya karena memang di sana pilpres nya 2008 karena di sini masih dua tahun terlalu dini berbicara tentang pemilu 2009
319775 kalau tidak kasihan rakyat selain itu program kita tidak akan terlaksana
319776 beliau ketua umum partai golkar bacaan saya tentu beliau harus melakukan komunikasi dengan golkar dan keluarga besarnya tentang proyeksi politik 2009 hubungan saya dengan pak jusuf kalla tetap baik tentunya menjadi kewajiban saya dan pak jusuf kalla untuk lebih mencurahkan waktu pikiran tenaga kami berdua untuk menjalankan tugas
319777 semuanya akan dikaji sehingga data data lengkap untuk kali pertama kami akan melakukan data sekunder kajian lingkungan serta analisis dampak lingkungan atau amdal
319778 dari aspek ekonomi saya meyakini akan lebih murah harapannya modal pembangunan kembali dalam jangka waktu 25 tahun dan kami meyakini jembatan lebih aman dibanding terowongan
319779 tapi saya berharap pembangunannya tidak main main masjid di aceh aman dari tsunami karena uang pembangunannya tidak dikorupsi saya yakin jss ini jika tidak dikorupsi juga akan aman
319780 oh hanya karena dia masih muda ini saja yang anda tahu
319781 pada saat kami meraih kemenangan dan orang orang berbondong bondong masuk untuk memeluk ke dalam ajaran agama islam maka kami memuji dan bertasbih kepada nya
319782 wahai engkau ibnu abbas bagaimanakah menurut pandanganmu mengenai ayat di atas
319783 ketika allah swt menurunkan ayat ini nabi saw diberitahu oleh allah bahwa ini adalah saat datangnya ajal sudah dekat sekali masa ajal itu akan datang wahai muhammad maka perbanyaklah kamu bertasbih dengan menyucikan dan memuji tuhanmu mohon ampunanlah pada allah swt
319784 wahai anakku aku akan mengajarkan kepadamu beberapa pelajaran pertama jagalah olehmu segala perintah perintah allah swt
319785 tidaklah beriman di antara kita sehingga kita ridha dengan apa yang diajarkan islam yang dibawa oleh nabi saw
319786 jika kamu menjaga segala perintah dan larangan allah niscaya allah akan menjaga kamu
319787 kedua peliharalah perintah perintah allah dan jauhilah larangan larangan nya dengan tulus maka akan kamu jumpai allah swt di depanmu
319788 wahai anak adam aku menderita sakit mengapa engkau tidak menjenguk ku
319789 wahai tuhan bagaimana engkau sakit padahal engkau adalah tuhan semesta alam
319790 hamba ku yang bernama fulan bin fulan sakit mengapa engkau tidak menjenguknya padahal jika engkau menjenguknya engkau akan menemukan ku di sampingnya
319791 apabila kamu meminta sesuatu maka mintalah kepada allah swt dan jangan sekali kali kamu minta pada yang lain
319792 kalau sekiranya lautan menjadi tinta untuk menulis kalimat kalimat tuhanku sungguh habislah lautan itu sebelum habis ditulis kalimat kalimat tuhanku meskipun kami datangkan tambahan sebanyak itu pula qs al kahfi 18 109
319793 keempat apabila engkau memohon dan mencari pertolongan maka hendaklah kamu mencari pertolongan dan bantuan hanya kepada allah swt
319794 ini adalah gaji kamu ambil sebelah kanan ada peternakan onta ambil juga yang sebelah kiri ada kebun kurma
319795 ketahuilah sekiranya semua orang bersatu padu dan berkumpul untuk memberikan manfaat kepada kamu maka tidak akan memberikan manfaat semua itu kecuali yang telah ditetapkan oleh allah swt
319796 demikian juga sebaliknya jika semua orang bersatu padu dan saling menolong untuk memberikan bahaya pada kamu maka mereka tidak akan memberikan bahaya apapun kecuali atas izin allah swt
319797 aku tidak berkuasa mendatangkan kemudharatan dan tidak pula kemanfa atan kepada diriku melainkan apa yang dikehendaki allah
319798 kamu akan jumpai allah di depan maka kenalilah allah pada saat kamu dalam suasana bahagia jika kamu selalu ingat pada allah di saat kamu bahagia maka allah pun akan mengingat kamu pada waktu kamu susah ketahuilah bahwa sesuatu yang sudah luput dari kamu tidak akan menimpa kamu
319799 dan apa yang akan menimpa kamu tidak akan bisa kamu hindari dan ketahuilah sesungguhnya kemenangan itu bersama kesabaran
319800 maka bersusah payahlah kamu karena kenikmatan hidup itu dalam bersusah payah
319801 kepunyaan allah lah kerajaan langit dan bumi dia menciptakan apa yang dia kehendaki dia memberikan anak anak perempuan kepada siapa yang dia kehendaki dan memberikan anak anak lelaki kepada siapa yang dia kehendaki atau dia menganugrahkan kedua jenis laki laki dan perempuan kepada siapa yang dikehendakinya dan dia menjadikan mandul siapa yang dia dikehendaki sesungguhnya dia maha mengetahui lagi maha kuasa

319804 while it is an unfortunate circumstance for an olympian to come this far only to lose a coveted position on the olympic team ms hardy is working expediently and agreeably to resolve the situation with as little impact to the u s olympic team as possible
319805 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
319806 im still going to be on the left side and play both ways we just hope that it will single up me a little more and open up our rush lanes a little more
319807 were looking at a number of different things well have him on the open edge keep him away from tight ends and be able to rush the passer more and play on the split end side
319808 you look at last year teams slid protections to him doubled teamed him chipped him with backs and he still got eight if he can get out there on the island like he does and ill take care of the rest of the garbage over there on the left side he can do whatever he does and he does it good
319809 its like writing with the other hand like writing with my left hand it takes practice you can do all right at it you wont be the best at it but youll be all right at it
319810 football is a great way to connect with people so we can then tell them about other things we have going on
319811 theres no doubt that the statute is pretty lenient with regard to how they can spend their money
319812 really the big prohibition is on converting it to personal use
319813 they have access to something that other people do not have access to
319814 very few alumni have access to this number of tickets and then that they could buy these with their campaign funds it may be legal but that doesnt mean it actually passes the smell test
319815 i think its a culmination of obviously frustrating moments individually and team wise
319816 im not going into a ton of details but i certainly regretted it immediately afterward
319817 i think that played a big factor and being frustrated it was a pretty impulsive thing it was a pretty quick thing not too much thought behind it
319818 the rule is from the commissioners office when someone gets ejected from a game for throwing at somebody it comes with a suspension
319819 our feelings are he has to go pitch and have some success and hes got to do better against left handed hitters
319820 preferir an no malgastar tiempo y recursos en contestar este tipo de acusaciones por carecer de sustento f ctico y jur dico
319821 viene cumpliendo normalmente los compromisos que asumi en forma voluntaria por el periodo 2004 2008 la cndc por su parte asumi un rol activo en el seguimiento y control del proceso realizando exhaustivas auditorias
319822 estamos cerrando un anillo de provisi n de energ a para las pr ximas d cadas y desde varios frentes hecho que resulta auspicioso no s lo para los misioneros sino para el resto del pa s adem s de la matriz energ tica propia y de la ampliaci n de la estaci n transformadora de san isidro que duplic la potencia que ingresa a la provincia los misioneros avanzamos en la posibilidad concreta de importaci n de los megavatios necesarios para responder a la demanda del mediano plazo es decir que por todos los frentes posibles estamos asegurando el crecimiento de la industria el comercio y la mejor calidad de vida de la poblaci n
319823 la m s auspiciosa de todas las que tuvimos hasta el momento para avanzar en esta posibilidad
319824 la causa abierta ha dado un importante paso en su instrucci n que implica el agravamiento de la situaci n procesal de alto paran ya que la resoluci n dictada equivale a un auto de procesamiento en el que se advierten indicios suficientes y semiplena prueba de los hechos denunciados que la comprometen
319825 la apertura del sumario no implica la emisi n de juicio alguno por parte de la cndc sobre la existencia de la conducta atribuida por amayadap y mucho menos sobre la responsabilidad de apsa
319826 contestada la vista o vencido su plazo el tribunal resolver sobre la procedencia de la instrucci n del sumario
319827 si el tribunal considera satisfactorias las explicaciones o si concluida la instrucci n no hubiere m rito suficiente para la prosecuci n del procedimiento se dispondr su archivo
319828 concluida la instrucci n del sumario el tribunal notificar a los presuntos responsables para que en un plazo de quince 15 d as efect en su descargo y ofrezcan la prueba que consideren pertinente
319829 apsa no ha efectuado a n su descargo sino que s lo brindo explicaciones por lo tanto resulta evidente que la apertura de esta instancia no representa bajo ning n aspecto que la comisi n tenga por acreditada ninguna conducta anticompetitiva y por lo tanto no constituye un agravamiento de la situaci n procesal de la empresa
319830 por m s escuelas lindas o feas por m s docentes con voluntad que tengamos por m s chicos traviesos o no evidentemente el camino del progreso no se podr recorrer si no sabemos defender esa calidad educativa que fue insignia en la rep blica argentina
319831 pol ticas p blicas tendientes a construir una sociedad inclusiva y con igualdad de oportunidades y de posibilidades
319832 i speak to people in the game a lot and they tell me about ajax who in the 1970s won the with an extremely young team and changed the face of the game
319833 people tell me that we are on course to do that but we need that stepping stone of winning something of knowing how to win
319834 before the euros i didnt know how it felt to win but now that i have experienced it i know what it takes you need to have tasted it
319835 look at chelsea they hadnt won anything in many years they got experienced players in won the league and that gave them experience and confidence together and others followed
319836 sometimes that is the key everyone said before last season that we werent even going to finish amongst the top four and we proved them wrong
319837 it would be beautiful he can play as centre forward or in the same role as raul just behind the forwards and also in the two positions in midfield
319838 ill use two different line ups for the two games so that we can keep running for the 90 minutes
319839 were working hard to be in the best possible shape for the

319853 there is a limit to what we can do in pakistan
319854 the fact that were reduced to trying to send messages to the pakistanis by putting stories in newspapers tells you we dont have any good options
319855 it also suggests that the high level face to face contacts havent worked so far the trouble is these kinds of public threats are likely to backfire
319856 one thing we never understood is that india has always been the major threat for pakistan
319857 pakistan over the last several years has increasingly come to believe that it is being encircled by india and a u s india afghan axis
319858 we have created a set of perverse incentives for the pakistanis to continue their support for the taliban
319859 pakistan does not view the united states as a long term player in the region and certainly doesnt view pakistans strategic interests as congruent with ours and that divergence is getting larger not smaller
319860 there is good evidence that elements of the isi have re engaged with the taliban

319880 im working with two of cgsocietys great artists whom are wholeheartedly involved in the concept artwork that is helping me to shape this new retro universe martin bland and alex ruiz i adore these guys
319881 well thats not entirely true due to their popularity last time around every issue of this series will include mini comics and those will show us glimpses of non wwii adventures i really enjoyed how the first series was able to play with different eras within the same narrative but i think from here on out well concentrate on particular time periods or particular themes this time world war ii is our framework for the series after this one it will pit robo against a threat in the 20s and it should end in the modern day but a single event from 1908 ties it all together
319882 just like the previous series every issue still works on its own but the links between issues are much more direct this time
319883 we were able to hop around time in the previous series by exploring robos memory in a kind of free association style this time were focusing on a particular theme and a particular era to link everything together
319884 hes one of these people you couldnt possibly make up because itd be too unbelievable and youd have to dial it back a few notches otto was hitlers number one special agent and in this series he commands a squad of laufpanzers these specialized armored troops weve also got dr vanadis valkyrie the head researcher for another nazi super weapon program helsingard is connected to both of these things but youll have to read the series to find out how
319885 i mean dont freak out were not doing band of brothers and also a robot were very much aware that people pick up robo comics to have fun and frankly wed get bored with it ourselves if we didnt deliver on that everything we see is from robos perspective and hes still a young bot in this story to him its one big adventure not in a frivolous way but lets face it he knows hes bulletproof and he takes advantage of that to thwart enemy soldiers at every opportunity
319886 what developed was a really healthy series of checks and balances between us as a team i found that while this was developing i began to invest more and more of myself in the project it quickly went from a job to an obsession then at some point robo evolved into something slightly different and brian asked me to become his partner in the project definitely one of those happiest moments of my life sort of thing
319887 being called the smartest person in a room full of cabbage
319888 there are the obvious things of course working on a project that you care deeply about working in flip flops and a bathrobe from the comfort of home and discovering that this thing you love and work on in your bathrobe is being received warmly by the readers
319889 watching the book take shape on the page seeing how it evolves from the written script to the final inks to rewriting the script to fix the parts that i ignored and then seeing how much better it gets once ronda pattison colors and jeff powell on lettering get their hands on it is a joy
319890 jeff is probably the coolest part of it he and i were good friends back in high school but when i left nyc we lost touch i knew that he had worked in marvels bullpen back when they had one and was doing stuff for archie comics but i hadnt spoken to him in almost ten years it took a lot of internet searching but i eventually found a friend of a friend of a friend who put us in touch renewing that old friendship has been great almost from the get go it was like ten minutes and not a decade had passed and we slipped back into that comfortable groove that good friends share

319912 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
319913 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
319914 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
319915 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
319916 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
319917 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
