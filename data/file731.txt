7310075 no hay voluntad pol tica en el gobierno ni en el partido de llevar a cabo una de las reformas estructurales m s importantes para consolidar la democracia
7310076 no s lo no rectifica sino que vuelve a hacer cosas en sentido contrario y que s lo refuerzan ese poder que ilegal e inmoralmente sustituye al estado y se genera de nueva cuenta un ciclo de complicidad y componenda

7310083 un partido sin debate interno tiene argumentos d biles frente a la sociedad
7310084 el cen se legitim por sus discusiones permanentes por sus debates constantes y yo no veo que haya ahora la idea de debatir nada porque hay otra estrategia ahora la ruta seguida no es discutir los problemas del partido y c mo podemos retomar nuestro talante de partido reformador o de cambio democr tico para el pa s estamos en la ruta de ser un partido de gobierno y con el objetivo exclusivo de ganar elecciones el electorerismo

7310234 we can be happy with the game but not the result
7310235 we brought it on ourselves against bielefeld we twice took the lead and couldnt keep it
7310236 well have to work on that but we have taken a step forward today
7310237 when you take a point from a game like todays then you have to be happy
7310238 we played against a very good side that are creative and offensive the goal we conceded was a defensive error
7310239 after that we tried everything that our goal came so late is perhaps a little lucky but we are not an easy side to beat
7310240 our methods have the potential for providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on

7310256 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7310257 hes essentially put a middle aged white guy on the ticket and i think it compromises the change message
7310258 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11 theres nothing else
7310259 it is a real tribute to the leadership of our nominee barack obama that he would select joe biden
7310260 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able bring to the table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7310261 from a published law review article without quotation or attribution
7310262 the fighting in georgia underscored the need to bring some foreign policy experience to the ticket its critical that the veep be willing and able to take an axe or at least an ice pick to the presidential candidate of the other party senator obama also needs to improve his performance with lunch bucket and working class democrats biden has spent his career appealing to those voters the obama campaign clearly made the decision that they did not need their veep pick to reinforce their change message and that was a smart move obama brings plenty of change and excitement on his own
7310263 was accused of plagiarism when he did not credit neil kinnock then leader of the british labor party for much of his stump speech
7310264 john quinlan a reporter for the sioux city journal said his notes showed biden said he was quoting kinnock when he used the same passage in a speech aug 14 stories in the new york times the boston globe and other newspapers also said biden had used the rhetoric and credited kinnock for it

7310268 numerous mainstream portland churches advertise bible study groups womens groups and church services in private homes these are just as much open to the public as rabbi wilanskys sabbath services
7310269 the city doesnt take action against landlords about noise and loud parties until after numerous complaints who made the decision to jump on rabbi wilansky after only one complaint
7310270 concerns about parking on the street and about a website inviting coreligionists to pray are not cause to infringe upon the first amendment
7310271 i feel it was truly a historic night for all the people of portland to see hundreds who came out from all religious faiths and from the entire jewish spectrum people who remained for hours late at night to hear the case and stand behind chabad that is tremendous

7310305 what do you know a screwdriver that does your screwing for you
7310306 its been a fantastic day for me because i scored and we take three points and the lead in the league
7310307 its a dream for me i scored my first goal in the spl and i think i won man of the match because i did not get a yellow card
7310308 three points and for the third match we have not conceded a goal we have good improved concentration we have a good keeper and defence and this is very important
7310309 it was a very bad tackle as the ball was near me and he had no chance of getting the ball
7310310 i will return to italy because i have no clothes i always have to wear the kilmarnock tops and tracksuits
7310311 it was scrappy there was not a lot of football played it was a battle
7310312 one or two of my players are hurting after that alex neils away to hospital and chris swailes is stitched up and over the piece kilmarnock won the battle and the football match
7310313 i think somebodys followed through accidentally and hit him on his nose and face he had a huge blow to the face and im concerned about him so he went away in an ambulance it was accidental
7310314 i dont know how bad it is he has a twisted knee it has not been a good day at the office
7310315 people say that in the spl to get the ball down and pass it but i dont think that was the case today saturday
7310316 unfortunately weve lost a goal in the forty fifth minute to a set piece and that was the difference between the two sides
7310317 no i dont think that was a lesson at all to be honest
7310318 he was the sort to send one manuscript to virginia woolf another to his good friend sergeant bob buckingham of the metropolitan police and fear the literary judgment of both
7310319 with the performance i am happy i am unhappy with the finishing and if we only scored 50 or 60 percent of the chances we created we could have one 6 1 or 7 1
7310320 at the moment i dont like anything more only a win that is most important
7310321 the team understand what i want we play football we dont kick and run we mover without the ball and we create the shots now we must learn to score and this is the only point i am worried about with the team
7310322 david obua is a very good football player but he wanted to show to everyone that he is okay and good and he had a very good chance with his head and he didnt do it but i think for the future this was not a bad choice to take david to hearts
7310323 kello was not so confident because goalkeeper is a special position and behind you is nobody and the harmony wasnt the best between marius zaliukis and berra and kello
7310324 but this is not possible because kello was here but zaliukas and berra were with their national teams also maybe if we find between the defence and the goalkeeper well have a very good goalkeeper
7310325 jamie mcdonald did not lose his place he was not in training he was with the under 21s and it is like a pre season for kello i need to give him a chance to play maybe against airdrie ill put ballogh in the goal right now we need to do everything to give the player a chance and this is the way
7310326 hes lost the weight you see when i came here and christian nade was 110kg about 17 stone and when i first saw nade he was making runs but he didnt run he walked
7310327 i thought that we deserved at least a draw at half time
7310328 prince bauben has had a great chance and the goalie has made a great save and then morgaro gomis hits the post from point blank range almost and then we score a good goal so i thought at half time i thought we deserved to be at least level maybe if we had been a little bit luckier we might have been in front
7310329 but there was no indication of what was going to happen in the second half
7310330 we just didnt come out of the traps in the second half at all and right from the kick off we gave the ball away and that allowed motherwell to attack us and get on the ascendancy
7310331 and i didnt think we performed that great in the second half
7310332 probably for the first time since i have been at the club i can honestly say after the game i dont think we deserved to get a point today but we did and thats quite pleasing for me
7310333 hes made one save in particular well the penalty i thought was top drawer i think it was a decent penalty it was hit hard and hes anticipated it and got a good hand to it
7310334 obviously looking at it that has probably kept us in the game with the we way were playing but then if i look at graeme smith and the save he made from prince in the first half was top drawer and then the one at the end was even better because it was going in the top corner and we could have sneaked it
7310335 we could have nicked the three points right at the end but in football you dont always get what you deserve
7310336 it might have been a bit cruel for motherwell but i wouldve been delighted
7310337 i thought we were very poor in the second half but youve got to give hibs credit because they are a good side who looked dangerous on the break
7310338 first half i felt we were positive and up for it and while hibs created a few chances i was quite happy with the way we played
7310339 the 30 seconds into the second half and we lose a goal and it just went from there really

7310410 vroeger was alles anders toen ik op kamers ging had je nog geen draadloos internet alleen de benenwagen naar de brievenbus aan het andere eind van de slotlaan
7310411 wij hadden destijds twee telefoons eentje op zolder en eentje beneden en dan moest je afspraken maken wie wanneer mocht bellen
7310412 the ufc said that i might fight with quinton jackson but nothing has been signed yet they called me and offered a fight with him and i accepted but they didnt say anything else
7310413 jacksons troubles surely can be a problem but i want him back in december and against me
7310414 there is an absence from work because of his condition contracted by his employment so we believe it is workers compensation leave and not sick leave
7310415 it is a matter for negotiation but i wont go into detail
7310416 if we cannot resolve it the matter will go to court
7310417 i stole one billion yuan from all of you but since i am a rascal scoundrel no one can do anything about me so i will take out 10 million out of 1 billion yuan and whichever label gives in first by surrendering and promises not to accuse me i will give them some money but whoever insists otherwise not a cent will be given out to them
7310418 although the mp3 business brings huge page view traffic the scale of revenue is still not big
7310419 you stole my money but when i ask you to give it back you say that you have used the money to run a business and you are running a loss now so now you claim that you only can give me a small sum of money
7310420 we want to enter the luxury car market by providing our affluent customers with great products and exceptional service
7310421 we expect to sell 300 units during our maiden year
7310422 lexus is distinguished by having outstanding products superior quality and service
7310423 we will be strengthening our ckd operations this is very important to us
7310424 our recent runs show that inflation is still going to peak in the third quarter
7310425 if the international prices of oil continue with the downtrend and then consolidate at a lower level then we may see inflation top at below 13 percent
7310426 right now we still see inflation going up to the projected range of six to eight percent
7310427 this knee has been giving me a lot of trouble its stiff all the time
7310428 we have treated people that were hearing voices and not getting the medication they need
7310429 they go to the emergency room when we are closed because they cant be turned away
7310430 it is a problem its a waste of resources and it frustrates the emergency room doctors
7310431 but it is not something we ask on a regular basis unless it is related to what we are treating
7310432 the hospital wouldnt put anybody out if they didnt have a safe secure place to go
7310433 if we know a patient is homeless we certainly take that into account for their treatment options
7310434 again if the patient doesnt reveal those things to us we have no way of knowing
7310435 it is not necessarily the fact that they are homeless that concerns us
7310436 its the factors that led them to be homeless such as the lack of a social support structure or the lack of medical insurance
7310437 its unstable that is the key thing that defines it
7310438 if you dont have a strong mind you would lose it over there
7310439 youd be discouraged too if you were looking for housing and employment and nothing was coming your way
7310440 there are pre med students and brody students that want to do this
7310441 anytime a doctor signs up within a day the volunteer list is full
7310442 its very frustrating because i feel like im begging doctors to come supervise us
7310443 they experience the exact same problems as other people in eastern north carolina its just that they dont have insurance
7310444 they come to us for ibuprofen and aspirin that four dollars may be dinner for them
7310445 they are very thankful because they know we are trying to help them and it gives them a sense of pride that they are helping with our education

7310457 important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7310458 hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7310459 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7310460 we have to think about the patient and not be dogmatic about it
7310461 and thats the problem in canada were very dogmatic about public and private and you know this public and private system exists everywhere in the world except three countries canada cuba and north korea
7310462 for example a surgeon could do 90 per cent of his surgery in the public system but if theres no operating room available then he could do maybe five or 10 per cent of his practice in the private sector
7310463 but then you dont need to lose that surgeon in the public sector because hes doing a small part of his practice in the private sector
7310464 today the associated press whose articles are published in thousands of newspapers nationwide wrote a story about barack obamas vice presidential pick that sounded more like right wing fox than an unbiased news organization
7310465 mccain doesnt understand the economy he doesnt know how it works
7310466 no one has supported president bush on iraq more than i have
7310467 we have a lot of work to do its a very hard struggle particularly given the situation on the iraq pakistan border
7310468 you know that old beach boys song bomb iran bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb iran
7310469 make it a hundred that would be fine with me
7310470 well its common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al qaeda is going back into iran and receiving training and are coming back into iraq from iran thats well known and its unfortunate
7310471 the fact is that i have agreed with president bush far more than i have disagreed and on the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush
7310472 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
7310473 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues i still need to be educated

7310490 let me told you what happened gt me i had jus loaded my favorite mule bessie into da gt gt i didnt ask for any details
7310491 i had jus got bessie into da trailer and i was driving down gt da road
7310492 judge i am trying to establish gt the fact that at the scene of the accident this man told the highway gt patrolman on the scene that he was just fine now several weeks after the accident gt he is trying to sue my client i believe he is a fraud please tell him to answer the question
7310493 id like to hear what he has to say about his favorite mule bessie
7310494 first i held up three fingers to represent the trinity he responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there
7310495 then i waved my finger around my head to show him that god was all around us he responded by poin ting to the ground to show that god was also right here with us
7310496 i pulled out the wine and water to show that god absolves us of all our sins he pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin
7310497 he bested me at every move and i could not continue
7310498 first he told me that we had three days to get out of italy so i gave him the finger
7310499 then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of jews and i told him that we were staying right here
7310500 he took out his lunch so i took out mine
7310501 as well as one of the most successful debut single to be release in the country 13 the success of utadas singles eventually lead the album
7310502 addicted to you the first single from the album breaking the one million mark in its first week and reaching 1 on the oricon singles chart for two consecutive weeks a personal first and eventually netting sales of 1 784 000 copies remaining utadas most successful single of all time

7310504 i dont think its the music that im concerned about its obviously that i look really different and there really arent any completely asian people who are popular singers in the u s right now

7310508 for those who export it has been and will continue to be through the holiday season a more challenging period for them
7310509 it might be a little worse in the u s but i still think the trend will be to purchasing later and a little bit less and being a little bit more selective with discretionary dollars
7310510 we expect to see continued growth over last year but at a pace that is softer than it was in 2007
7310511 theres no question we have seen a small decline in employment in canada we have seen the cost of gas chew into family budgets but generally factors are still quite positive for canadian consumers
7310512 a lot of people who might not have otherwise been in the market find themselves as the school year starts kicking tires on new devices and new services
7310513 the electronic store today really is the toy store for adults and as consumers when we want to feel better about ourselves and want to buy something that diverts our attention from the trials and tribulations of life increasingly the electronics store is where we head

7310516 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
7310517 conflicts in the region would be viewed in a wholly different more reassuring and tolerant context if there were a binding and strong security pact that assured non use of force these conflicts are not frozen in the absence of a security pact there is an arms build up that is in itself destabilizing distorting national budgets and hampering the normal development of civil society yet in the caucasus our countries and peoples have lived under a common umbrella far more than we have been divided today we share a common vision of european integration a vision that is greater and more enduring than issues that divide us it is in the broader context of european integration that our issues should be resolved although integration with europe is not controversial nato expansion is never in history has a grand coalition formed to defeat a particular enemy survived after the task was completed not after the napoleonic wars not after world war i and not after world war ii after the wests cold war victory two things happened nato tried to reinvent itself by directing its attention and resources to other regions and addressing other problems containing russia was not a declared intention and nato created the euro atlantic partnership council which invited all eastern bloc and former soviet republics to participate this was visionary and potentially sustainable after all the organization for security and cooperation in europe and the council of europe extended their efficacy in that way by including the remnants of the ussr not only did they remain relevant and viable they contributed immeasurably to our own growth and development but nato also planned to continue and even expand in the same form even after its stated goal had long been met given the changed security environment and russias great security sensitivities this was it appears a strategic mistake georgias eagerness to get into nato is understandable but the security benefits to georgia that nato membership would bring would be offset by the creation of a dividing line in the caucasus and its attendant security challenges perhaps this is the caucasus moment a historic opportunity in the context of a new regional security pact for brussels washington and moscow to meet with tbilisi yerevan and baku and create a nonaligned caucasus free of security memberships and adversarial alliances such positive engaged inclusive neutrality will be possible and beneficial all around this would be in the best interest of this highly combustible region a u s russia confrontation at the georgia russia level will make life very difficult not just for us here in armenia but also for azerbaijan and turkey it is in the context of these existential security issues that we must view the recent turkish proposal for a caucasus stability and cooperation platform the black sea economic cooperation pact for example was created precisely for the purpose of bringing together those who otherwise shared no common forum for economic cooperation and the resolution of problems but its effectiveness has been limited because turkey lacked the commitment to use the forum as a way to relate with a country like armenia with whom its borders are closed the proposal today in this new tense environment must be more serious and sustained it must marginalize no one security issues are intertwined and they ought to be addressed in a stability pact with a comprehensive strong security component during his visit to baku last week turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan discussed the turkish plan and publicly made reference to armenias inclusion it is also a fortuitous coincidence that president abdullah gul of turkey has been invited by president serzh sargsian of armenia to watch the turkey armenia fifa world cup qualifying match on sept 6 together this offers an opportunity for these two neighbors to discuss common security challenges and pave the way for a region of peace
7310518 i had two weeks to try to impress nick the first is out of the way and i seem to have done that

7310525 we are so excited to finally get spore into the hands of fans and players
7310526 the maxis studio has had an absolute blast creating spore but the fun is just beginning the most engaging stories are truly the ones people create themselves and we cant wait to see how players not only craft and explore the spore universe but hear what stories they have to tell as a result
7310527 there is a rich history to the civil war especially in terms of covert military tactics
7310528 american warfare in the 1860s was brutal yet surprisingly sophisticated so it was essential for us to capture this duality
7310529 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
7310530 ive got nobody worth comparing to him so im going with the job killer in the funny underwear i used to be somebody so vote for me besides im on bath sides of every issue so you cant say i dont represent you when im sitting at one of my numerous kitchen tables eating my musilix
7310531 at least hes not mcbushsame who dumped his crippled wife and collaborated with the nvs blah blah blah
7310532 china has won the most gold medals and the united states of america won the most total
7310533 i believe each country will highlight what suits it best one country will say gold medals the other country will say the total tally counts we take no position on that
7310534 in the end there wasnt much reason for me to smile
7310535 because the pressure of being a gold medalist is huge
7310536 it was freer before but we live in a different world now
7310537 its what all or nearly all organizing committees have to live with
7310538 it is unlikely that you will see a games of this size and scope and stature ever again
7310539 our priority is to leave a legacy for the community
7310540 our message has been clear and unambiguous to use the london games to drive the participation in olympic sports
7310541 my goal is to make d c the highest performing urban school system in the country

7310554 wir denken gar nicht dar ber nach was die konkurrenz macht
7310555 nur eine frage dessen wo man steht und wie viel ressourcen man einsetzt
7310556 wenn man beispielsweise 100 leute braucht um ein f1 auto zu bauen dann haben wir 150 leute
7310557 zwei rennen vor schluss sind es dann vielleicht 70 leute am 09er auto und so weiter
7310558 a spokeswoman for the british olympic authority said there is going to be the opportunity to celebrate the success through different media
7310559 has grown to such proportions that it was necessary to alter the custom
7310560 it has come to my attention that there are several problems or inconsistencies in the way presidential wreaths have been used in the past
7310561 in response to random requests which seem unworthy of the significance that should accompany these tributes
7310562 most impressive it is appropriate for a great nation to honor the memory of its past leaders in such a manner you are to be commended for initiating such a program
7310563 i would think something like that should have been done long before me and it ought to continue to go on
7310564 hes from here the white house recognizes that and you get an order from them to honor your country its a big deal
7310565 my goal is to make d c the highest performing urban school system in the country

7310575 to think that this all started in that bloody womb of mine but i am glad i had it to bear you two
7310576 dad im wondering here mum is in the capable hands of staff whose authority she accepts at home shell just try to be the boss
7310577 she ought to come home it feels more natural if she dies there and i want to be around her for a bit i dont want to drive to this depressing hospital every day and leave her alone at night
7310578 we prefer not to receive telephone calls visitors or flowers
7310579 as soon as this medication loses its efficacy i request euthanasia
7310580 it should be your own decision none of us is to say anything
7310581 i think what she finds unbearable is not so much her pain and sickness but the fear of it getting worse and of losing control
7310582 the doctor had to ascertain if i was not being forced into euthanasia
7310583 i was planning to stay with some friends this weekend
7310584 and who has got more priority then your friends or your terminally ill mother
7310585 why dont you stay with your friends next week when im dead youll have all the time in the world then
7310586 when im dead its just going to be your dad and me here
7310587 does it happen at all that people pull out at the last minute
7310588 quite often i go home again and a new appointment is made but in many cases the patient passes away between visits
7310589 can i just ask you something is there still a lot you feel you need to do
7310590 i can always come back later if you are not ready
7310591 why did the paraplegic cross the road because he was stapled to the chicken
7310592 there isnt that divide where theres a couple of huge movies coming every week

7310595 there isnt that divide where theres a couple of huge movies coming every week

7310598 we want him to continue he has proved to be a very good coach
7310599 it has been a fantastic achievement you couldnt have asked for better terrys contract is up in march next year and we will sit down with him when hes come back and had a rest to talk about his future
7310600 he needs to take a huge amount of credit for qualifying eight boxers to come to these games

7310602 the campaign consciously or unconsciously became much more of a media operation than simply a presidential campaign because they recognized that by putting their message out onto these various platforms their supporters would spread it for them
7310603 we are going from the era of the sound bite to the sound blast
7310604 the athletes were never expected to carry the water for the activists it is a matter of individual conscience
7310605 ultimately it is more of an indictment of the atmosphere of intimidation and censorship imposed by the chinese government not to mention the confusing messages
7310606 softball 2016 but no headbands for darfur no tibetan flags
7310607 id suspect a major reason for this is that olympic athletes see the games as a once in lifetime opportunity to shine in their sport stand out and possibly cash in
7310608 its a moment that theyve been training and preparing for all their lives and to risk tarnishing all their hard work with a protest or political statement just isnt worth it
7310609 if at all we have threats from any quarter its from indian forces
7310610 for the foreseeable future new orleans will be surrounded by levees unable to protect against another storm like katrina when the army corps of engineers finishes 14 8 billion in post katrina work the city will have what are defined as 100 year levees under that standard experts say that every house being rebuilt in new orleans has a 26 percent chance of flooding again over a 30 year mortgage and every child born in new orleans would have nearly a 60 percent chance of seeing a major flood in his or her life
7310611 the official competition at the venice film festival may be called venezia 65 but it is just coming of age as a launching pad for academy award fare
7310612 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7310613 furthermore because there already are drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7310614 this is a very important discovery as it not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
7310615 releasing even a portion of this carbon into the atmosphere in the form of methane or carbon dioxide would have an significant impact on earths climate
7310616 es ist fantastisch dieses rennen gewonnen zu haben besonders nach der entt uschung von budapest
7310617 das team leistete wahnsinnige arbeit bei der vorbereitung auf diesen grand prix und die vorteile konnte man schon am allerersten tag sehen gestern sicherte ich mir die pole position und heute den sieg die schnellste rennrunde ist die sahne auf dem kuchen man kann nicht mehr verlangen besonders bei meinem 100 grand prix von denen ich jeden einzelnen mit einem ferrari motor bestritt
7310618 ich bekam einen guten start hin und ging von den ersten runden an ans limit im zweiten teil des rennens war das auto au ergew hnlich aber auch im letzten abschnitt als ich die weicheren reifen hatte konnte ich locker gute rundenzeiten fahren dies ist ein wichtiger moment in meiner karriere und ich muss in dieser art weiterarbeiten mir tut leid was kimi passiert ist wir m ssen unsere zuverl ssigkeit sehr sorgf ltig unter die lupe nehmen ich bin zuversichtlich dass das team wei welche gegenma nahmen getroffen werden m ssen um auf dieses problem zu reagieren so wie es dies in der vergangenheit immer getan hat
7310619 nach einem tag wie diesen gibt es nicht sonderlich viel zu sagen
7310620 es war definitiv nicht das wochenende das ich mir erhofft habe aber ich glaube nicht dass ich trotz dieses negativen ergebnisses nun aus dem rennen um den titel raus bin es sind noch sechs rennen zu fahren und damit 60 punkte zu holen wir haben gesehen dass sich die situation wirklich schnell ndern kann selbst wenn ich realisiere dass es nun komplizierter wird
7310621 heute verlor ich am start einen platz und hing im gesamten ersten teil des rennens im verkehr fest als ich dann eine freie strecke vor mir hatte war ich in der lage druck zu machen und gute rundenzeiten zu fahren beim zweiten boxenstopp machte ich einen fehler und fuhr los bevor ich dies h tte tun sollen
7310622 gl cklicherweise ist pietro timpini nicht allzu sehr verletzt ich w nsche ihm alles gute und hoffe dass es ihm bald besser geht es h tte sowieso nichts ver ndert da der motor kaputt ging nun m ssen wir uns darauf konzentrieren uns auf die kommenden runden vorzubereiten und unsere qualifying leistung zu verbessern
7310623 felipe zeigte das gesamte wochenende ber eine gro artige leistung
7310624 er war fantastisch und verdient all unser lob ungl cklicherweise waren wir einmal mehr nicht zuverl ssig sowohl aus der sicht der technik als auch in bezug auf die art und weise wie wir auf der strecke gearbeitet haben wenn man sieht was bei r ikk nens boxenstopp passierte und dass der motor kaputt ging erste untersuchungen deuten auf einen hnlichen fehler wie ihn felipe massa in ungarn ereilte
7310625 gl cklicherweise erlitt pietro timpini der mechaniker der betankte und bei kimis zweitem stopp verletzt wurde nur eine kleine fraktur an seinem linken fu und das ist nichts besonders ernstes heute haben wir zwei seiten der medaille gesehen wir verf gen ber ein gro artiges potenzial sowohl vom team als auch vom auto sind in der lage uns vor allen zu platzieren aber wenn nicht alle elemente an ihrem optimum arbeiten dann werfen wir wertvolle punkte weg die uns teuer zu stehen kommen wir m ssen daran arbeiten diese probleme zu beheben und das werden wir nun die kommenden tage ber tun
7310626 gestern war er im qualifying sehr schnell und heute fuhr er mit einem makellosen stil ohne dass er einen falschen fu setzte er holt sich damit nach der entt uschung von budapest einen absolut verdienten sieg ich m chte ihm mein kompliment aussprechen und auch dem ganzen team das so hart gearbeitet hat um sich auf diese veranstaltung vorzubereiten ungl cklicherweise litten wir einmal mehr an einem problem mit der zuverl ssigkeit dieses mal an kimis auto das uns wertvolle punkte gekostet hat
7310627 nun m ssen wir herausfinden was bei diesem weiteren motorschaden passiert ist und entscheiden wie wir reagieren das was passierte ist nat rlich ernst und wir werden alles in unserer macht stehende tun um in den kommenden rennen den boden gutzumachen den wir durch die probleme mit der zuverl ssigkeit verloren haben nun m ssen wir weiterhin maximal druck machen um das auto zu entwickeln und die zuverl ssigkeit zu verbessern so dass wir auf die kommenden rennen so gut wie m glich vorbereitet sind wir haben in monza und in jerez noch zwei test einheiten und eine menge harter arbeitstage in der fabrik vor uns liegen
7310628 abschlie end m chte ich ein paar worte ber pietro timpini verlieren unseren mechaniker der ungl cklicherweise bei kimis zweitem boxenstopp verletzt wurde seine ersten worte waren worte der entschuldigung denn er dachte dass der zwischenfall sein fehler war durch die leidenschaft widmung und die professionalit t die diese jungs t glich f r ferrari zeigen wird deutlich wie speziell unser team ist
7310629 wir konnten uns heute davon berzeugen dass aue sicherlich kein einfacher gegner ist au erdem werden sie zu hause verst rkt zu werke gehen es wird ein v llig anderes spiel in dem sie nichts zu verlieren haben
7310630 sie sind eine sehr sehr kampfstarke mannschaft und ein dfb pokalspiel vor heimischer kulisse ist nat rlich nicht mit dieser partie zu vergleichen da werden sie sich ganz anders pr sentieren und davor m ssen wir gewappnet sein
7310631 aue zurecht in die 3 liga geh rt sie werden am ende der saison sicherlich auch nichts mit dem abstieg zu tun haben

7310677 with the selection of senator joe biden as senator obamas vice president the democrats ticket has now become an even greater gamble for the jewish community
7310678 throughout his career senator biden has consistently been wrong on iran and his voting record on israel has been inconsistent like obama biden fundamentally misunderstands the threat posed by an iran determined to obtain nuclear weapons

7310753 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why
7310754 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
7310755 only by doing this will people be able to arrive at a coherent history of the shroud which takes into account and explains all of the available scientific and historical information
7310756 hes had other ideas but theyve all been shot down and this one will be shot down too
7310757 if you love christ why wouldnt you want to explore the possibility that you have an artifact of his material existence on earth
7310758 how i think about the shroud comes from the shroud its not gee im a christian so ill force it to be what i want it to be thats not scientific logic
7310759 its like were on an archaeological expedition thats not finished im not sure well ever be truly finished
7310760 a lot of the pleasure is in the journey itself
7310761 if we get to the point where we believe we have a viable hypothesis that works in the lab then we have scientific grounds to go to turin and say heres what we think has happened to the shroud
7310762 said jackson who does not subscribe to the theory that the tested sample was different than the rest of the shroud
7310763 the united states invaded iraq based on false premises the administration orchestrated a public relations drive to prove that iraq had weapons of mass destruction and connections to the 9 11 terrorists both proved false
7310764 whereas the efforts of international weapons inspectors united states intelligence agencies and iraqi defectors led to the discovery that iraq had large stockpiles of chemical weapons and a large scale biological weapons program and that iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program that was much closer to producing a nuclear weapon than intelligence reporting had previously indicated
7310765 to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability
7310766 beginning in may 2004 isg recovered a series of chemical weapons from coalition military units and other sources a total of 53 munitions have been recovered
7310767 initially saddam chose to conceal his nuclear program in its entirety as he did with iraqs bw biological warfare program aggressive un inspections after desert storm forced saddam to admit the existence of the program and destroy or surrender components of the program in the wake of desert storm iraq took steps to conceal key elements of its program and preserve what it could of the professional capabilities of its nuclear scientific community
7310768 many locations associated with previous wmd programs and sites under monitoring by the united nations have been completely looted often there is nothing but a concrete slab at locations where once stood plants or laboratories
7310769 we cannot express a firm view on the possibility that wmd elements were relocated out of iraq prior to the war
7310770 isg technical experts fully evaluated less than one quarter of one percent of the over 10 000 weapons caches throughout iraq
7310771 saddam wanted to end sanctions while preserving the capability to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction when sanctions were lifted
7310772 members of al qaida an organization bearing responsibility for the attacks are known to be in iraq
7310773 attacks underscored the gravity of the threat posed by the acquisition of wmd by international terrorist organizations
7310774 necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations including those who planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001
7310775 pre war administration statements that iraq provided safe haven for abu musab al zarqawi and other terrorist members were substantiated by the intelligence assessments
7310776 postwar information supports prewar assessments and statements that abu musab al zarqawi was in baghdad and that was present in northern iraq
7310777 one of the reported contacts between iraq and before the war has been confirmed and two other meetings have since been identified
7310778 a sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to draw inferences
7310779 that iraq provided material support to bin laden and al qaeda iraq collaborated in or supported bin laden al qaedas terrorist acts of september 11 iraq provided materiel support to al qaeda and that it did so with knowledge and intent to further al qaedas criminal acts
7310780 iraq both poses a continuing threat to the national security of the united states and international peace and security in the persian gulf region and remains in material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations by among other things continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability and supporting and harboring terrorist organizations
7310781 to assassinate former president bush and by firing on many thousands of occasions on united states and coalition armed forces
7310782 that threaten the lives and safety of united states citizens
7310783 to release repatriate or account for non iraqi citizens wrongfully detained by iraq including an american serviceman
7310784 on many thousands of occasions on united states and coalition armed forces engaged in enforcing the resolutions of the united nations security council
7310785 to use united states armed forces pursuant to united nations security council resolution 678 1990 in order to achieve implementation of security council resolution 660 661 662 664 665 666 667 669 674 and 677
7310786 statements by the president vice president secretary of state and the national security advisor regarding possible iraqi nuclear weapons program were generally substantiated by intelligence community estimates but did not convey the substantial disagreements that existed in the intelligence community
7310787 statements regarding iraqs possession of biological agents weapons production capability and use of mobile biological laboratories were substantiated by intelligence information
7310788 statements regarding iraqs possession of chemical weapons were substantiated by intelligence information
7310789 statements regarding iraqs possession of weapons of mass destruction were generally substantiated by intelligence information though many statements made regarding ongoing production prior to late 2002 reflected a higher level of certainty than the intelligence judgments themselves
7310790 statements regarding iraqi ballistic missiles were generally substantiated by available intelligence
7310791 statements that iraq was developing unmanned aerial vehicles that could be use to deliver chemical or biological weapons were generally substantiated by intelligence information but did not convey the substantial disagreements or evolving views that existed in the intelligence community
7310792 statements regarding iraqs support for terrorist groups other than were substantiated by intelligence information
7310793 statements that iraq provided safe haven for abu musab al zarqawi and other terrorist members were substantiated by the intelligence assessments
7310794 the president has authority under the constitution to take action in order to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the united states as congress recognized in public law 107 40
7310795 to take appropriate action in accordance with the constitution and relevant laws of the united states to bring iraq into compliance with its international obligations
7310796 little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism but peace easy taxes and a tolerable administration of justice all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things

7310811 china has been quick to catch up with india and surpass it in terms of art prices despite paying attention to art post 2004 bulk of the buyers of chinese art are westerners who started looking to quality chinese art in galleries spread across hong kong the indian market on the other hand is homegrown
7310812 few people were interested in chinese artists and their art
7310813 the global nature of the collectors have changed most of them have made money on their own which has given an amount of self confidence they see good things about indian and chinese art on the front pages of newspapers and flock to the global sales
7310814 now you have celebrities collectors like charles saatchi and frank cohen buying indian art i am sure we will cross the chinese market in the next three to four years
7310815 they are more focused on quality and only the best are being picked up it has never happened in the art market before

7310822 we have different gifts according to the grace given us if a mans gift is prophesying let him use it in proportion to his faith if it is serving let him serve if it is teaching let him teach if it is encouraging let him encourage if it is contributing to the needs of others let him give generously if it is leadership let him govern diligently if it is showing mercy let him do it cheerfully

7310824 nosotros creemos que es posible avanzar en negociaciones con bloques y frentes y ofrecerles una salida digna venimos haciendo un an lisis muy cuidadoso de la situaci n de hecho hemos tenido contactos con algunos mandos importantes de frentes y bloques de la guerrilla tanto de las farc como del eln y vemos que es viable avanzar en esas desmovilizaciones
7310825 hay cansancio eso lo hemos evidenciado hay p rdida del sentido de lucha y por eso creemos que hay una situaci n madura para las desmovilizaciones colectivas el reto es convencerlos de que tambi n con ellos podemos pactar procesos dignos
7310826 es indudable que la capacidad militar del erg se disminuy de manera significativa por la ofensiva militar si no es as ellos no habr an recapacitado pero tambi n se les ofreci una negociaci n digna estamos interesados en enviar ese mensaje que el gobierno sabe tender la mano

7310833 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7310834 they are voting for mccain not because they want him but because they are voting against obama actually you are voting against your country
7310835 who despite the hype doesnt seem to know as much about foreign affairs as they want us to believe and is also confused as to how many homes he owns and what kind of car he drives
7310836 those views are outside the view of mainstream republican thought
7310837 who will be the most effective person in the role of the vice presidency and in that make the most of the position for the country issues and people
7310838 romney never praised barack obama saying he would be proud to run with or against him
7310839 i think its really important for people who advocate reforms to live to the spirit of the reforms they advocate
7310840 i think somebody who makes campaign finance an issue has got to be consistent and walk the walk
7310841 who will be the most effective and knowledgable person in the role of vice president with an obama presidency
7310842 our studies have predicted a specific 3 dimensional shape displayed by a key protein that interacts with telomeres
7310843 this prediction has now provided us with a crucial tool that has propelled forward our studies of this protein
7310844 without est1 telomerase cannot get to the ends of chromosomes and thus telomeres shorten
7310845 the recent increase in the ability to predict protein structure is now permitting detailed analysis of many proteins including proteins like est3 whose function had been mysterious
7310846 this is surprising because tpp1 is not a subunit of the telomerase complex
7310847 what we now propose that this particular protein fold which both est3 and tpp1 exhibit is uniquely suited to the telomere
7310848 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7310849 furthermore because there already are drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7310850 this is a very important discovery as it not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
7310851 this finding means that it is possible to offer simple non invasive screening for patients with a family history of neuroblastoma
7310852 as we increase our knowledge of alk mutations we will also offer specialized diagnostic testing for all newly diagnosed patients with neuroblastoma to eventually allow oncologists to better customize treatment to a childs genetic profile
7310853 its an advantage to be able to start with agents that have already been shown to be safe in adults
7310854 together with this current study we are defining the genetic events that underlie this childhood cancer
7310855 better understanding of these biological pathways will guide our efforts to develop more effective treatments

7310859 jews found deliberate abortion unacceptable they also rejected exposure of children yet their opinions differed widely as to the penalty for accidental or therapeutic abortions christians viewed the fetus as gods creation they insisted that the destruction of the fetus was murder and that the perpetrators should be punished as murderers didache 2 2 and barnabas 20 1 2 prohibited abortion as murder the earliest information in the new testament seems to occur in the vice lists where pharmakeia may refer to the drug used in abortions clement of alexandria quotes an earlier christian writer who inferred from luke 1 41 that life begins at conception ecl 41 48 49 cf his own words in paed 2 10 96 the apologists defended christians against charges of immorality by noting the communitys rejection of abortion athenagoras leg 35 some christians practiced abortion however as hippolytus haer 9 7 and cyprian ep 52 2 indicate the council of elvira ca 305 can 63 68 enacted punishments against infanticide perhaps abortion the council of ancyra 314 can 21 prohibited abortion basil ep 188 2 ambrose hex 5 18 58 and jerome ep 22 13 supported that stance augustine quest exodus 9 80 and quest hept 2 differed as to when life began but he found intentional abortion of the formed fetus to be murder john chrysostom hom 32 in rom viewed deliberate abortion as murder
7310860 whence women reputed believers began to resort to drugs for producing sterility and to gird themselves round so to expel what was being conceived on account of their not wishing to have a child either by a slave or by any paltry fellow for the sake of their family and excessive wealth behold into how great impiety that lawless one has proceeded by inculcating adultery and murder at the same time
7310861 the womb of his wife was smitten by a blow of his heel and in the miscarriage that soon followed the offspring was brought forth the fruit of a fathers murder and now does he dare to condemn the hands of those who sacrifice when he himself is more guilty in his feet by which the son who was about to be born was slain

7310907 the panasonic lumix fx35 is a very stylish wide angle digicam with outstanding shooting performance the 4x optical zoom with the 25mm wide angle lens and 10 megapixel imaging sensor really compliment the ia shooting mode and o i s system the only thing holding these camera back is the noise that is present in the dark areas of all the photographs no matter what the iso setting
7310908 the panasonic fx35 is a well built digicam with an impressive piece of glass the leica dc vario elmarit that starts at a very wide 25mm equivalent and extends 4x to 100mm unfortunately that was where the fun stopped the panasonic fx35s menu system is painful to use and basic functions like digital zoom are awkward or simply not functional the panasonic fx35 packs some smart photo technology inside and if that was all anyone ever needed it might make the grade but thats not all anyone needs really ia mode is a better auto for many situations but none in which you want to control the camera ultimately it comes down to image quality and the panasonic fx35 compromises just a little too much with soft corners in images and odd demosaicing that produces a grainy appearance across the image

7310918 i believe they wanted it a bit more than us in the first half and the corner when they scored shows that
7310919 you think youd like to play ball with the law

7310921 cool as ice is a 1991 film loosely based on rebel without a cause and often referred to as the vanilla ice movie when first released cool as ice was universally panned by critics however over time it has become something of a cult classic cinematography by janusz kaminski who later became the much lauded regular cinematographer on steven spielbergs movies from schindlers list onwards johnny a freewheeling motorcycle riding musician rolls into a small town with his band and meets kathy an honor student who catches his eye meanwhile kathys father after being in the witness protection program is finally found by the two corrupt cops he escaped from years ago who claim he owes them a lot of money vanilla ices motorcycle was a 1991 suzuki gsx r750m his friends rode a pair of 1987 1990 kawasaki zx 750r bikes

7310930 we went to the area and found out that the bombardment was very heavy lots of houses have been destroyed and more than 90 non combatants including women children and elders have died
7310931 they have claimed that taliban were there they must prove it
7310932 so far it is not clear for us why the coalition conducted the air strikes
7310933 the foreign troops are not coordinating their operations with afghans they just dont do it

7310958 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain
7310959 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
7310960 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
7310961 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies

7310963 on the threshold of the new world order a rebirth for the united nations
7310964 collective security today must encompass not only the security of nations
7310965 but also mankinds security in a global environment that has proven vulnerable to debilitating changes wrought by mans own endeavors
7310966 thus in setting an american agenda for a new world order we must begin with a profound alteration in traditional thought
7310967 administration if not absent has been little more than an onlooker
7310968 foster the conditions and institutions necessary for a free economy and a free body politic to thrive
7310969 we should seek a steady mutual draw down to a ceiling of no more than 500 warheads per side
7310970 we should cut the gordian knot of difficult dismantlement by acting immediately to sequester all warheads to be eliminated
7310971 must be able to use force to stop rogue nations like north korea
7310972 nato should abandon its anachronistic posture the defense of allied territory against direct attack to make a great leap forward and adopt peace keeping outside nato territory as a formal alliance mission
7310973 the president has opposed every congressional effort to impose serious sanctions or even link trade to more reasonable chinese policies on human rights and the sale of dangerously destabilizing arms
7310974 no one can expect that trade sanctions against beijing would yield a sudden transformation of that regime but american foreign policy should leave no doubt and the bush administration has left much doubt that the united states stands squarely on the side of chinas brave and aspiring democrats to whom power will ultimately flow
7310975 for the united states it should become a paramount priority to promote american environmental technologies and services around the world
7310976 we do not despite what the president or anyone else may say have to choose between jobs and the environment

7310988 we have no leadership and no direction that is america today in the cities the rural areas and in indian country things must change and that change process will begin in denver
7310989 native attendees at the convention will carry the wishes of their people and will return to their homes having taken their rightful place in this political process
7310990 they will be energized and will be ready to make a difference for barack obama and for democratic candidates in many races
7310991 dass 12 milliarden euro in deutschland an steuergeldern mal eben versenkt werden und niemand in der regierung sagt er tr gt die verantwortung
7310992 ich halte es f r selbstverst ndlich dass das zust ndige untergremium des haushaltsausschusses ber die neue sachlage gr ndlich informiert wird
7310993 die opposition kann einen untersuchungsausschuss gemeinsam durchsetzen wenn sie sich einig ist
7310994 barack obama has engaged a whole new generation of people
7310995 have been taking some baby steps in addressing concerns of indian country
7310996 i think its good for both parties to fight over the native american vote
7310997 platform committees for both parties included native americans and we felt very satisfied at the work we got in both of those platforms
7310998 i dont think the political process has made much room for us over time
7310999 and as they beckon us in we will approach it with some hesitance that is human nature
7311000 to be effective in the party organization you must be engaged for a long period of time
7311001 we are beginning to find success the quicker we realize that the better off we are
7311002 politics have changed in how things are done in indian country the real question is where do we go from here
7311003 and also there is something about being a black female that is perhaps even more conflicting than any other race we are brought up to be proud exceedingly proud of our heritage and yet many of our beauty rituals are taken from idolizing and perpetuating standards of the white race we straighten our hair we lighten our skin etc etc etc we tell ourselves that black is beautiful and yet we spend hundreds of dollars doing whatever it takes to not remind ourselves that everyone does not think black is beautiful its never been a conscious thing for me until it is a conscious thing for me i like to get extensions because i like the idea of long hair until i eventually hate the idea of long hair and i get them removed with that said there is something about the process of removing the hair piece by piece which usually makes me break down and cry i begin to realize a bevy of things that i placed a heavy amount of my beauty on my hair that by getting extensions i am consciously extracting myself from my black identity to fit into the white society in which i am almost exclusively entrenched in and yet always isolated from that the freedom i feel from not having to worry about the way i look because i know my hair is in a shape that most black women could only dream of makes me angry depressed and regretful
7311004 releasing even a portion of this carbon into the atmosphere in the form of methane or would have an significant impact on earths climate
7311005 i think marriage is the hottest furnace of the spirit today
7311006 much more difficult than solitude much more challenging for people who want to work on themselves its a situation in which there are no alibis excruciating most of the time but its only in this situation that any kind of work can be done naturally i feel ambiguous about it
7311007 if a girl in paris has only one record its a leonard cohen album
7311008 nobodys ever twisted my arm perhaps because nobody ever saw any great profits to be made from my work
7311009 i was told i was a descendant of aaron the high priest
7311010 you couldnt get leonard to work with other musicians because he felt they were all laughing at him and they mostly were
7311011 its something that is in the mind from time to time
7311012 but when it really comes down to it the thing i like best is the song that stands by itself that you can walk around that just has its own life
7311013 if people can use the material in other areas im very happy
7311014 i was living in franklin in tennessee and id come into nashville just to see a movie wed been living out in the sticks for a long time and i saw this movie called
7311015 i was in the studio that night in nashville and i got this call from a chap called robert altman and he says listen you know i love those songs ive built a film around them can i use them i said who are you he said well i i did
7311016 i said i know it was enormously successful but i havent seen it
7311017 i said listen i just came out of the theatre i saw it twice you can have anything of mine you want
7311018 i did do some additional music only one thing that was used i did a guitar background for a little soliloquy by warren beatty its just barely perceptible but that is one of the nicest things i ever did i love that piece
7311019 then i saw the picture the finished picture without the music the soundtrack hadnt been completed
7311020 then i went to the theater in montreal and i saw the picture with the music and everything and it was great
7311021 the canadians are like the jews theyre continually examining their identity
7311022 i live in montreal which is a french city in quebec which is a french country especially now it is a country
7311023 so in a sense i live like a foreigner in my own city cut off by the fact that i dont speak french that well i can get by but its not a tongue i could ever move around in in a way that would satisfy the appetites of the mind or the heart
7311024 and because i live in french canada were estranged from the writers who live in toronto and winnipeg and vancouver so all these things are curious walls that either insulate or protect or exclude depending on how you look at it
7311025 i dont think anybody knows me as a writer or as a singer in montreal
7311026 montreal is a good base for me my center in the world
7311027 i spend time in greece in tennessee in mexico but i always go back to montreal
7311028 a lot of people wonder if you are as depressed as your songs sound and if so why
7311029 i cant really answer that i think that when people hear a song they hear it in a realm where these questions are irrelevant its only after they stop listening that the questions arise the songs themselves dont partake of a description like elation or depression its like a sexual embrace there are no questions until you step outside of the embrace separate yourself from it
7311030 theres a real quality of intimacy it seems to me
7311031 in everything youve written that im aware of intimacy in terms of what youre saying about yourself or just in the nature of the situation youre describing is this something you feel art or writing should do or something you find you have to do or
7311032 of course one is aware that there are different degrees different styles of approaching in other men and other works but ive never had an aesthetic that commanded me to approach my material in a certain way it
7311033 i always thought i was being objective i always thought i was being clear i always thought i was being factual its just a relative sense that its intimate in my own interior landscape its not intimate enough its still much too far from the interior reality thats what im working on
7311034 i have some songs now in the works that i think
7311035 ive always tried to make a documentary of the interior landscape i say to myself what
7311036 thats where the language comes of course one word leads to the next and as you know when words happen to be your medium they have their own contagion and their own susceptibility and their own invitations and their own hospitality to other words
7311037 but in terms of the subject matter and the approach its always been a documentary approach an attempt to establish the authentic events
7311038 before coming to new york id performed now and then in a very limited way id gone around canada read and sang
7311039 there was also a very fine group of poets in the city where i got my training wed put out our own books our own magazines there was no contract or deals made with any other part of the world we did consider ourselves self sufficient and the training was quite rigorous
7311040 did you travel to speak of in those early years
7311041 i always thought that montreal was one of the sacred cities of the mind and i never felt any desire at all to travel out of montreal it was not until i was 24 which is quite late in terms of traveling that i left the city i went to europe id gotten an award for a book i had written
7311042 i went to london and then im not a very good traveler i went to greece and i stayed there for the next eight years id never been in a sunny place and id never known what the sun was so i fell in love with the sun and a blonde girl and a white house
7311043 yeah most of the work was written there and even now though the new songs were at least three or four or even five years in the making it was in greece last summer that those ten or twelve golden days came when i was able to see the end of the songs see them to completion my house in greece which i still have ive heard it described in the european press as a villa which always amuses me this little house up on a hill its always been a good place to work in
7311044 a lot of people criticized me although i moved out of my house at the time of the coup in greece and i stopped living there then i cant acquire any virtue or merit from this act because it wasnt political
7311045 but it had nothing to do with politics i think the greek people are in a sense above their own politics thats a supercilious thing to say but the average guy there hell turn the picture over to the next leader go down and wave his flag for the next governor with a sense of i think profound contempt and sophistication about the whole process because theyre very much in touch with their own existence
7311046 you never felt you were treated bad as an american canadian
7311047 no i got there with the very first wave of foreigners when there were only five or six of us and we were a novelty we were their entertainment you know our goings on with drinking and girls we were their theater they gave us credit and they were very nice to us very helpful
7311048 i had a little record player that ran on batteries i would work outside on my terrace and if i would forget how fast the sun was moving and forget to move the record would melt right over the turntable i used to play ray charles all the time and i lost a couple of ray charles records i still have them theyre just like dali watches just dripped over the side of the turntable
7311049 well ive never been intimidated by form what we call a novel that is a book of prose where there are characters and developments and changes and situations thats always attracted me because in a sense it is the heavyweight arena i like it it frightens me from that point of view because of the regime that is involved in novel writing i cant be on the move it needs a desk it needs a room and a typewriter a regime and i like that very much
7311050 no i havent this will be the first book of prose since then the book is called
7311051 i think this is the traditional path of gifted people in america its obvious this is what happened to faulkner to frost to miller to a lot of jazz musicians americans are very very provincial they really are reluctant to accept new things they are totally ignorant about what is going on in other countries these countries in europe are old old cultures with a tremendous sense of tolerance and curiosity built into them so theyre very interested in new american products were not at all interested in theirs or in our own
7311052 i seem to be caught in the critical establishment between two critical houses on one side the literary people are very resentful that i have made money in the rock world this suggests to them somehow that i have sold out
7311053 and on the other side a lot of people in the rock establishment in their articles i notice that they always suggest that i dont know anything about music that my tunes are very limited as if i couldnt work in an augmented chord if i really thought it was needed
7311054 whereas in europe this doesnt exist theres no energy wasted on placing me because the culture is wide enough to include a figure like myself without any sense of abrasion
7311055 does it have any kind of effect on you or do you think on the musician in general
7311056 at this point yes i am interested in uh the market journey of the product but im very very interested also in the mind of the reviewers how they change over the decades and how a man approaches new work whether he approaches it in a spirit of curiosity charity interest or as a vehicle for his own self aggrandizement his own career whether he uses it as an opportunity to display humanism or cruelty i mean to me the critic is on trial at this point
7311057 the judge has no choice a singer must die for the lie in his voice
7311058 i never asked but i heard you cast your lot along with the poor how come i overheard your prayer that you be this and nothing more than just some grateful faithful womans favorite singing millionaire the patron saint of envy and the grocer of despair working for the yankee dollar
7311059 i was unaware of rock music when i first came with my songs to new york i didnt really know what was happening
7311060 so i thought i would head down to nashville i thought i could write some songs in that area
7311061 but i was really very moved when i came to new york by what was going on
7311062 i felt the exhilaration of the moment and i suppose i succumbed to the expectations of the moment and subsequently to the disappointments of the moment
7311063 so at the same time where you indulge yourself with certain feelings of paranoia disappointment disillusion on the other hand another kind of information establishes itself in the heart and the mind and you feel that this is the world and youre happy to know it
7311064 and then you maybe throw your weight behind other kinds of possibilities you can begin to understand other kinds of human institutions like marriage like work like order you begin to withdraw although part of the emotion will always be attached to anarchy to chaos to wild creativity to notions like that you begin to balance those concepts against other ones like law and order and i mean it in the real sense not just a political slogan but the real law and the real order that seems to govern our existence
7311065 very rarely one crosses into the other realm but the songs are by and large designed as songs and the poems designed as poems
7311066 it could be read as one poem one long poem this book
7311067 it depends on what part of the being is operative of course its wonderful to write a song i mean there is nothing like a song and you sing it to your woman or to your friend people come to your house and then you sing it in front of an audience and you record it i mean it has an amazing thrust and a poem it waits on the page and it moves in a much more secret way through the world and that also is well they each have their own way of travel
7311068 in a sense its natural but like every other thing that we call natural it takes a lot of work and practice
7311069 no it has the same terrors and pitfalls and possibilities for humiliation for me personally its a kind of dangerous work but so is writing if youre really going to lay your life out
7311070 yeah performing i mean you can really be humiliated there are other rewards and prizes that go with it you can come out with a sense of glory girls might fall in love with you they might be paying you very well all the possibilities of corruption and material gain and self congratulation are present but also at the same time there is this continual threat and presence of your own disgrace
7311071 you felt quite able to project the very personal interior vision of your songs in front of 130 000 people
7311072 but an audience of two or three or four thousand is the real test because you can really do all the wrong things you can play to the crowd you can play for laughs you can play for self pity you can play for heroic aspect there are so many ways of selling out in front of an audience theres no such thing as a casual performance one has an exact notion of what one is going to do out there
7311073 what are you trying to achieve in your songs what is your ambition
7311074 to make oneself attractive to master it to keep busy and avoid the poolroom and try to get good at what youre doing really its all an alibi for something nobodys ever been able to talk about
7311075 mostly my idea of a song is when you feel like singing and this is your song its not what songs should be not choosing this is the song you make because its the only one you can make this is the one that is yours the fact is that you feel like singing and this is the song that you know
7311076 most of the time youre just scraping the bottom of the barrel to find any kind of voice at all it could be a few words a tone of voice two chords together its a ragpickers trade as i practice it i dont stand on the mountain and received tablets
7311077 john lissauer is fantastic people are going to know about him way beyond the contribution he makes to my scene

7311178 ho avuto recentemente una violenta discussione con un mio caro amico di sinistra e mi sono reso conto che parla e argomenta come gli articoli dellunit o del manifesto o di repubblica certo ognuno pu avere le proprie idee ed opinioni ci mancherebbe ma questo mio amico cerca sempre di convincermi che una persona intelligente non pu essere di destra perch destra uguale a fascismo che senso ha oggi questa parola la causa della discussione stato il proclama del mio amico che ha stigmatizzato come la patente a punti non servita a nulla tanto anche se la ritiri guidano anche senza patente brunetta sta facendo solo propaganda nonostante le lamentele le ferrovie continuano a non funzionare napoli non stata ripulita anche questa solo propaganda del presidente spazzino e via andando ora io sono convinto che se berlusconi parlasse di meno e facesse meno palcoscenico ne guadagnerebbe qui non siamo in america dove il presidente suona il sassofono e viene apprezzato non abbiamo la cultura un po kitch degli anglosassoni per probabilmente lazione del governo difetta ancora di comunicazione oppure quelli di sinistra sono cos presuntuosi da non vedere o voler vedere i risultati che altri ottengono certo tutto perfettibile quindi se invece di criticare e prendere in giro con la loro arroganza e presunzione quelli di sinistra fossero pi collaborativi potrebbero nascere delle belle azioni condivise ed eque ma questa in italia fantapolitica purtroppo

7311355 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7311356 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7311357 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7311358 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out
7311359 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7311360 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved

7311379 bear in mind people were starting to see the african american civil rights movement build at this time there was a confluence of things going on including a movement in the folk music scene and he was at the forefront of all of this
7311380 in the folk music crowd everybody knew everybody everyone was interrelated
7311381 there was this great community of musicians with everyone playing everywhere
7311382 he was probably one of the most charismatic people youve ever known he had a warmth that just emanated
7311383 he walked into a room and lit it up people gravitated toward him because of that ability to reach out and touch people and really care about them just about everybody who knew him thought he was their best friend he had that effect on people

7311420 j discutimos isso na comiss o de atletas mas n o tem sido f cil
7311421 a cao tenta falar com os atletas mas em alguns casos surgem nos os seus agentes nas reuni es s comparecem um quarto ou um quinto dos convocados e alguns s o primas donas
7311422 receio que o progressivo aumento de condi es n o devidamente regulamentadas e responsabilizadas possa ter levado ao aburguesamento de alguns agentes desde atletas a dirigentes passando por treinadores
7311423 tempo de regulamentar e responsabilizar o usufruto das condi es que o pa s oferece

7311436 two guys go off on a cross country road trip to promote some product
7311437 they realized that sitting in front of a computer all day was going to kill them
7311438 we just need the game so we can mould the test team and give them a game before we play a test against australia
7311439 they want to back a winning side but we never go out there to lose on purpose and its a new playing style im trying to get out there rome wasnt built in a day and i ask the people to be patient to give us more time
7311440 it was all about execution because the chances were there but we cannot make mistakes like we did today its unacceptable for any international player
7311441 it was interesting when we screened the film for some of the parents and the kids
7311442 the parents were really moved they had no idea the kids were thinking those thoughts it just goes to show that if you take the time and pay attention and if youre quiet enough you hear things
7311443 he has patiently but persistently exposed dangerous predator priests and their corrupt church supervisors kids are safer because of his courage and compassion
7311444 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7311445 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7311446 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7311447 we dont think he is going to tell the backstory so the whole thing just seems kind of icky
7311448 when someone seems like they are hiding something its a big turnoff to the public
7311449 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7311450 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7311451 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7311452 she said yes so i took off my jersey and said well then id better not bring this in either
7311453 listen the kids going to be a big part of us winning here
7311454 we just need him to get back to where he was
7311455 if it takes him to go down and pitch a couple of games to get there thats what were going to do
7311456 estamos hablando de libertad de expresi n no solo de dar noticias programas de opini n como este estamos hablando tambi n de programas de todo tipo
7311457 el problema es cuando se declara estrat gico y se dice que el estado es responsable de la administraci n y se constituye empresas p blicas para administrar estos sectores o empresas de econom a mixta sector privado y gobierno en el mejor de los casos el estado ser solo socio pero con el 51 por ciento va a ser due o o socio
7311458 la constituci n estatiza la propiedad privada en el pa s y dora la p ldora con estos articulitos la prueba es cuando se incluye a los sectores estrat gicos y luego en el art culo 384 dice que se armar un sistema nacional de comunicaci n social ah estar todo ya todos son del estado ah est todo
7311459 no pueden las libertades estar controladas por el estado es pretender implantar ideolog as y cada individuo debe ser respetado no podemos callar a otros
7311460 en la constituci n no puede haber algo que cuelgue de los test culos la libertad de expresi n
7311461 el problema de correa es el fantasma de hugo ch vez no quiere que le pase lo que le pas a ch vez

7311463 hes been there for over thirty years but hes also the kind of guy who goes home every night so he is not part of that washington infrastructure that gets itself out of touch hes a regular guy
7311464 he has been around for a while he obviously understands these issues extremely well he understands the process he understands whats important to american growth so i think hes just a great edition

7311470 on more than one occasion been brought back in my mind to classes i took with dr bennett
7311471 on the threshold of the new world order a rebirth for the united nations
7311472 collective security today must encompass not only the security of nations
7311473 but also mankinds security in a global environment that has proven vulnerable to debilitating changes wrought by mans own endeavors
7311474 thus in setting an american agenda for a new world order we must begin with a profound alteration in traditional thought
7311475 administration if not absent has been little more than an onlooker
7311476 foster the conditions and institutions necessary for a free economy and a free body politic to thrive
7311477 we should seek a steady mutual draw down to a ceiling of no more than 500 warheads per side
7311478 we should cut the gordian knot of difficult dismantlement by acting immediately to sequester all warheads to be eliminated
7311479 must be able to use force to stop rogue nations like north korea
7311480 nato should abandon its anachronistic posture the defense of allied territory against direct attack to make a great leap forward and adopt peace keeping outside nato territory as a formal alliance mission
7311481 the president has opposed every congressional effort to impose serious sanctions or even link trade to more reasonable chinese policies on human rights and the sale of dangerously destabilizing arms
7311482 no one can expect that trade sanctions against beijing would yield a sudden transformation of that regime but american foreign policy should leave no doubt and the bush administration has left much doubt that the united states stands squarely on the side of chinas brave and aspiring democrats to whom power will ultimately flow
7311483 we do not despite what the president or anyone else
7311484 es ist so dass alle schon auf ein foul warten seine fouls sind dann fast immer automatisch eine gelbe karte
7311485 wir machen immer wieder die alten fehler abwehrfehler stellungsfehler das zieht sich jetzt schon ber jahre
7311486 wir m ssen was f r die defensive tun das kann man sich nicht leisten wenn man sich so wie wir international positionieren will
7311487 wir sind noch lange nicht da wo wir hinwollen n chste woche machen wir das besser
7311488 wenn wir jetzt schon oben w ren w re die bundesliga doch schon wieder langweilig
7311489 desde o in cio da campanha estamos percorrendo a cidade discutido seus problemas e solu es continuaremos assim at a vit ria
7311490 cresci 40 e a pesquisa pegou somente o primeiro programa de tv referindo se entrevista ao telejornal rj tv da rede globo que foi ao ar na quarta 20 a medida que os programas na televis o forem avan ando tenho certeza de que vou crescer ainda mais nas pesquisas
7311491 tenemos que estar seguros de que lo que digamos a las familias es la verdad
7311492 i believe that there is one god i affirm the unity of all creation and take the example and teachings of the human jesus as my way in life
7311493 i just want to study and be with my mom
7311494 a lot of guys try to run the same game that they ran over there but they end up falling on their face
7311495 you see we know spanish but we dont know the exact words and when we try to explain to somebody something theyre like huh
7311496 they shouldnt have deported you so soon after your surgery
7311497 i cant walk both my feet are in bad shape
7311498 finish high school and then you can come here at least here you have your grandparents your cousins over there what do you have
7311499 they deport them at any hour at 10 p m at midnight and in some cases they wind up in the street or they sleep in the offices of mexican immigration agents
7311500 to try our best not to bring women or juveniles after dark
7311501 i dont know how but im going to make it
7311502 its a noble thing that they want the family to be reunited but they are exposing them to danger
7311503 i just want to go back to michoacan with my mom
7311504 looking at photographs of the gravely wounded or dead is a profoundly affecting and emotional experience she said however i do feel that it is my duty as a journalist to see that a truthful account of the consequences of war is given
7311505 to see that a truthful account of the consequences of war is given
7311506 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
7311507 h h was daar al die drukte nu voor nodig
7311508 we remove the impaired driver that come through our checkpoint and the community and motorists know that we are still taking it seriously
7311509 all kinds of things are going on that are pushing people into this slow food place
7311510 we dont want the slow food movement to be about celebrity chefs and fancy restaurants
7311511 this is something very new for a lot of people in the mainstream
7311512 this food gets lumped into its only for the people who want to pay the price
7311513 but you know people are willing to pay it on nike shoes and cell phones and god knows what else theyll pay it on
7311514 they dont see that if you dont pay up front you pay out back youre going to pay in your health and in the loss of your culture and in the pleasure of your life
7311515 for me it means really bringing people to those difficult ideas of biodiversity and sustainability through the pleasure of the table
7311516 you smell these flowers and lemon verbena and basil its intoxicating
7311517 you dont need the rhetoric you just need the plate of food
7311518 it cant really be defined by the number of people giving their money
7311519 but there are many many people engaged in this kind of thinking and thats what really counts
7311520 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7311521 if i were in the obama camp i would lock
7311522 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7311523 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7311524 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7311525 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7311526 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7311527 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7311528 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us
7311529 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps

7311533 the fundamental problem in the american economy is that for years people treated rising asset prices as a substitute for personal savings

7311542 we want to encourage competitive sports in schools not the medals for all culture we have seen in previous years
7311543 it was wrong because it doesnt work in sport you get better by challenging yourself against other people a lot of sports are team games where people have to work together but they play against other teams
7311544 im very proud weve done as well as we have i had to be here today its such a momentous occasion
7311545 when it comes to the olympics theyre just brilliant they bring out the best in everyone theyre just such a happy event
7311546 it means a lot that london has them its something to be proud of instead of just moaning about the country its time to strike out and show what we can do
7311547 were not going to be able to compete with all the amazing graphics beijing has done but in our own way it will be equally good
7311548 if we can maintain that funding and get more investment that would be great
7311549 the more people start thinking positively and start promoting the london olympics as a positive thing the more successful theyre going to be
7311550 theyre going to be good for business good for development and infrastructure in the long term there will be all the facilities which we wouldnt have if we didnt have the olympics
7311551 its a once in a lifetime thing for it to be in my country im so very proud
7311552 we should be positive weve waited for years for it to come back people just need to get behind it and support their country
7311553 the tube is already so crowded i cant imagine it then with all the tourists coming over it will be a nightmare

7311560 i know that after the summer weve just have people dont really want to hear about saving water however i think this is a really beneficial decision from the minister for the environment
7311561 currently more than one third of the drinking water we treat here in ireland is used to flush toilets this new regulation will mean that all new toilet cisterns must be supplied with a dual flush dual flush toilet cisterns have a mechanism that allows two modes of operation involving a 6 litres and a 4 litres flush by contrast current single flush cisterns generally use between 6 litres and 9 litres per flush
7311562 its estimated that if the dual flush toilets are installed in all new dwellings it should reduce drinking water consumption by approximately 10 in these dwellings or by almost 500 million litres of drinking water every year this is beneficial both from the environmental point of view in saving water but also as a means of saving money as it is expensive to treat water to ensure it is safe to drink its ridiculous that so much treated drinking water is literally being flushed down the toilet each year and it is great to see that much of this waste will now be avoided

7311577 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7311578 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7311579 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7311580 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7311581 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7311582 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7311583 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7311584 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7311585 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should ben affleck be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us
7311586 why shouldnt he be in denver he has nothing to be ashamed of
7311587 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps
7311588 i dont think oprah hurts i think she helps a lot

7311593 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor
7311594 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead
7311595 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7311596 joe biden has a long record of experience its in sharp contrast to barack obamas record
7311597 we feel like its a bit of a disguise pick hes trying to disguise hes the most inexperienced candidate in the modern era
7311598 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
7311599 but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7311600 an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team
7311601 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy

7311617 every city has had its big twist on the games what they have thats different to every other county
7311618 the olympic movement is about bringing the world together im not sure what that difference will be but im looking forward to seeing what it is and how this city develops
7311619 we will draw on our wit flair imagination and ingenuity to build on what weve all witnessed in beijing and deliver a fantabulous olympics in what i consider to be not only my home but the home of sport
7311620 im london born and bred and i think it will do really big things for the city
7311621 the next summer games return to a country which i frequently boast has either invented or codified just about every major world sport
7311622 when i left it was all recession recession recession and weve come back to a country overwhelmed by olympic success
7311623 theres an overwhelming sense of people being excited by the next olympics being in london
7311624 a perfect storm of negative economic trends is battering working families across the united states
7311625 two thirds of the working age population was uninsured underinsured reported a medical bill problem or did not get needed health care because of cost in 2007
7311626 more than two in five adults in the 19 to 64 age group reported problems paying medical bills or had accumulated medical debt in 2007 up from one in three in 2005
7311627 i know that s not what everyone says some pundits claim that the united states has a uniquely individualistic culture and that americans won t accept any system that makes health care a collective responsibility
7311628 there s every reason to believe that a program that extends universal coverage to the nonelderly would soon become equally popular consider the case of massachusetts which passed a state level plan for universal coverage two years ago
7311629 the massachusetts plan has come in for a lot of criticism
7311630 obviously the biggest barrier to this is making sure john mccain isnt elected he literally
7311631 obama cant argue that hes a centrist on health care with no plans for increased government involvement because he likes to say things like if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system
7311632 his plan manages to occupy an uncomfortable middle space where its neither liberal enough to really fit into the sharp liberal argument nor centrist enough to protect him from attacks of being a traditional liberal and thats not a point of abstract logic in the primary he got slammed for not being liberal enough and now hes getting slammed for being too liberal its almost no surprise that obama doesnt really seem interested in making health care a defining issue its not really worked for him thus far

7311654 yes they have an experience with jesus christ who alone can set the captive free
7311655 if in his demon possession he can break ropes which are 1 8 inch in diameter could psychology help him then but not if he can break ropes up to 1 4 inch in diameter
7311656 and having spoiled principalities and powers satan and all of his henchmen were defeated at the cross by christ atoning for all sin sin was the legal right satan had to hold man in captivity with all sin atoned he has no more legal right to hold anyone in bondage he christ made a show of them openly what jesus did at the cross was in the face of the whole universe triumphing over them in it
7311657 it is impossible to separate psychology and theology as they relate to the counseling process the object of counseling is a human being created in gods image wholeness is achieved only when life is lived in the manner in which he intended therefore it is not a question of whether therapists rely upon the holy spirit or upon their counseling skills we must equip ourselves with the best tools available while being certain that the presence and power of the holy spirit permeates our personalities
7311658 that the presence and power of the holy spirit permeates our personalities
7311659 according as his divine power has given unto us all things the lord with largehanded generosity has given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness pertains to the fact that the lord jesus has given us everything we need regarding life and living through the knowledge of him who has called us to glory and virtue the knowledge addressed here speaks of what christ did at the cross which alone can provide glory and virtue

7311679 latest indications from china are that the state council are likely to approve the proposal to raise export taxes on fertiliser sometime in august the global market will then be short of urea and the slight correction we are seeing today is unlikely to endure
7311680 internationally phosphate prices are now static and as latin americas absence from the market continues prices are likely to remain so
7311681 while the market is quiet and we have seen a slight dip in prices an opportunity exists gleadell have product in the uk now for spot and forward deliveries
7311682 the difference this year is that in such a volatile market it is difficult to sell forward before we know our cost prices
7311683 this means we can only sell what we have available on a month by month basis
7311684 unlike the grain markets there is no effective futures market for the fertiliser industry therefore we cannot buy raw materials forward

7311706 i felt he was more seasoned he balances the ticket out he answers that question people have about experience
7311707 ive seen senator biden was not able to galvenize people even around his own candidacy
7311708 im pleased about the declaration and grateful to president bush

7311717 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7311718 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7311719 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7311720 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7311721 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
7311722 tremendous groundbreaking figure everyone admires her greatly he is going to need her in the senate

7311729 s amp p tracks 7 000 companies so the vast bulk are still either maintaining or raising their dividends
7311730 the market is sending a signal about sustainability at that point
7311731 the light volumes are really sort of the reasons behind why youve got some outsize moves i think the issues over all for the economy and the market are fairly well understood
7311732 the market is of this mind set that were going to continue to be flattish to down
7311733 we need to absolutely find a bottom in financials to really believe that the bear can be behind us
7311734 i was prepared to feel relieved having you know about everything not needing to keep secrets from you but i didnt expect to feel more than that i like it it makes me happy
7311735 youre still waiting for the running and the screaming arent you
7311736 of all the ways in which we tried to game out what rock bottom would look like even we would not have anticipated that two septuagenarians would be sentenced to re education through labour while the games were going on
7311737 the chinese government continues to give us an endless stream of material to work with and has an incredible tin ear
7311738 behind all of the pomp and glitter an untold number of chinese citizens are now languishing in labour camps prisons or simply missing as a result of these games
7311739 this repression will be remembered as one of the defining characteristics of the beijing games
7311740 the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation
7311741 people walking on the street are so happy so optimistic about their own tomorrow the athletes are happy about their performance about the competition about everything they see
7311742 there is one narrative that is the accepted narrative if you are on board with that narrative you can fully enjoy the games you can get excited by the chinese gold medals you can be part of this national project

7311779 with pervez musharraf out of the picture the us is in quandary over whom to support in pakistan in their fight against taliban as civilian leaders asif zardari nawaz sharif and yousaf raza gilani are less than ideal for washington
7311780 civilian leaders asif zardari nawaz sharif and prime minister yousaf raza gilani are all less than ideal to become the go to figure for the united states in pakistan
7311781 doubts are growing among american officials over the level of cooperation they can expect from the new army chief ashfaq parvez kayani a former head of intelligence who took over the post from mr musharraf in november 2007
7311782 the two countries have established a good neighbourly partnership and enjoyed friendship generation upon generation
7311783 mr prachanda has come to the beijing olympics closing ceremony within a week after being sworn in
7311784 this fully demonstrates the great attention nepal attaches to relations with china and its profound friendship with the chinese people we highly appreciate that
7311785 i know i will not get my deposit back but i want to cancel the cake anyway
7311786 the parliament is sovereign and one has to look at the future of pakistan s democracy which is more important than individuals as such
7311787 personally i am in favour of the chief justice but there are people in the party who say that he has become too politicised now

7311789 the intrusiveness of the surveillance is kept to a minimum
7311790 in the tragic airstrike and irresponsible and imprecise military operation in azizabad village in shindand district more than 89 of our innocent countrymen including women and children were martyred
7311791 the speaking fee for mr musharraf would be in the range of 150 000 200 000 a day plus jet and other vip arrangements on the ground
7311792 you can t change america and give our workers a fighting chance when after 3 million manufacturing jobs disappear you continue to support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas
7311793 you can t change america and end this war in iraq when you declare that no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have you can t change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of mr bush s presidency
7311794 we don t have to have four more years of mr bush and mr mccain
7311795 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think he s going to be very formidable
7311796 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been
7311797 were suppressed for the last couple of quarters and we have assumed that there isnt any substantial snap back as we look at next quarter
7311798 this is all bunk and we dont have to think of it at all because it doesnt match with our faith
7311799 well this evidence is pretty weak but theres nothing intrinsically unlikely about his body turning up he was buried someplace
7311800 oh yes the children played in that tomb and we had to install a concrete cover to keep them out
7311801 this discovery could destroy the faith of billions of chrstians
7311802 well this evidence is pretty weak but theres nothing intrinsically unlikely about his body turning up he was buried someplace
7311803 when the women entered the tomb of joseph of arimathea on sunday morning the loculus where jesus body had been laid was empty the theological explanation for this phenomenon is that jesus was resurrected from the dead however once jesus had been buried in accordance with jewish law there was no prohibition against removing the body from the tomb after the end of the sabbath and reburying it it is therefore possible that followers or family members removed jesus body from josephs tomb after the sabbath ended and buried it in a trench grave as it would have been unusual to say the least to leave a non relative in a family tomb whatever explanation one prefers the fact that jesus body did not remain in josephs tomb means that his bones could not have been collected in an ossuary at least not if we follow the gospel accounts
7311804 this discovery could destroy the faith of billions of christians
7311805 the truth is exactly in the middle between these two positions
7311806 48 i have long suspected that in american journalism every argument has exactly two sides
7311807 then did jesus add now technically im not actually in my flesh and bones which bartholomew buried in jerusalem after nipping round the back of the cave two days ago but i still you know have them just not on me and i didnt really eat that fish just hacked into your visual cortex to make you think i did still good trick right and all the apostles did groan and slap their foreheads
7311808 imagine how bummed youd be as a penguin with some monster leopard seal pushing around the ice chunk you were chillin on
7311809 it is well known and has been well known for a couple hundred years now that the nt writers are not eyewitnesses
7311810 christianity is the only religion on the planet that can be disproven objectively
7311811 crucifixion in the ancient world and the folly of the message of the cross
7311812 lifes most urgent question is what are you doing for others
7311813 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7311814 she had 50 percent of the democratic vote obama has 50 percent of the democratic vote
7311815 you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7311816 senator joe bidens personal story has been tested many many times
7311817 when you overcome adversity tragedy in your life as he has the kind of wisdom you get in the working class communities of scranton pennsylvania and wilmington delaware
7311818 theyre equally good tickets hillary clinton obviously has a longer relationship with a broader spectrum of voters women voters
7311819 but joe bidens going to grow on the american people very fast
7311820 they had a discussion back in early june about it and he spent more time with senator clinton alone talking about issues than he has with joe biden or anyone else
7311821 knew her he knew her very well and so there wasnt the same need as there was for other candidates
7311822 theres no question that people had strong feelings about their nominee we went from beginning to end
7311823 i think thats going to be the role of the convention to really be a unifying time
7311824 hes got to talk about economic issues and hes got to be more clear
7311825 we need certainly senator obama to let the americans know what his plan is for as president of the united states how hes going to help rebuild restore the middle class
7311826 i dont accept that thats what barack obama hasnt been doing and i think that he will give a clear picture again this week of where we have to go
7311827 joe biden works in washington but he doesnt live there
7311828 he is somebody who never has forgotten where hes from hes a down to earth kind of guy
7311829 you can pull up a lot of quotes from august when these two guys were running against each other
7311830 its a legitimate issue mccain either forgot how many he has or he just wasnt being truthful with those reporters
7311831 youre out of touch if you have seven houses and dont even remember
7311832 nothing good in the world has been accomplished without passion
7311833 the dread of public shame or private scorn though no excuse for murder may urge the victim of seduction to commit a crime at once so abominable and so dangerous

7311835 the marvel of marvels is not that god in his infinite love has not elected

7311855 twenty five taliban were killed including sidiq and one other commander
7311856 every generation there are changes in peoples relationship with government
7311857 government should do more especially when youre spending tens of billions of dollars in iraq protecting the interests of millionaires
7311858 weve got to revoke the tax cuts for the wealthy
7311859 we definitely need to do something more for the economically disadvantaged weve allowed big corporations to take millions for corporate leaders while workers get nothing
7311860 during the era when bill clinton was president there was a clear re centering of the party
7311861 there is a growing understanding that government can play a positive role in investing in our country
7311862 enormous dissatisfaction with the republican party has brought out the base more
7311863 the rise of the internet and bloggers have made the party more progressive
7311864 by 1980 the average person said i dont need government anymore
7311865 the whole world changes and people feel a little bit at sea and they need help
7311866 by financially punishing noncompliant states with the loss of federal funding the regulation would intrude on the authority of states to enact and enforce laws that ensure womens access to birth control
7311867 this is a giant step down a road that will potentially leave women with a major loss of access to contraceptive methods
7311868 pregnancy is not a disease to be treated by abortion and neither is fertility
7311869 to be coerced to treat it as if it were a condition that is pathological is unjust
7311870 there is an organized effort to force health care professionals to do things that violate their conscience
7311871 is not abortion or contraception but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience
7311872 an environment in the health care industry that is intolerant of certain religious beliefs ethnic and cultural traditions and moral convictions

7311884 the identified famous sites will be blocked first and the trc will look to see what sort of technical assistance can be provided to assist in this
7311885 this is where access is open but on computers with this package certain sites are blocked
7311886 the current package was not planned for such a large subscriber base
7311887 there is no foolproof method to completely block them all but it depends on how the authorities expect us to implement it
7311888 we have to do what can be done as soon as possible to implement this

7311894 who then is this that he commands even winds and luke 8 25
7311895 he sends out his command to the earth his word runs swiftly he gives snow like wool he scatters hoarfrost like ashes
7311896 all things work together for good for those who love him and are called according to his purpose
7311897 are not two sparrows sold for a penny and not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your father fear not therefore you are of more value than many sparrows

7311904 a powerful political force diverting popular attention away from secular social and political action encouraging a passive acceptance of existing conditions
7311905 for the catholic upper class as well as the prussian authorities the counterrevolutionary and socially pacifying efforts of the religious revival were visible and most welcome
7311906 if the political impetus for the christian social movement came from the need to counter social agitation the movements organizational form was an outgrowth of the sodalities congregations and related catholic organizations which had developed in the industrial areas after mid century
7311907 the enemy of religion is liberalism whose faith is disbelief and whose mother is the revolution

7311926 resolutely challenge with a united voice the predictions that newspapers are near death we have a platform we must use to champion measurements other than circulation to show our value our successes and in some areas our growth apme must become a champion of newspapers before the gloomy forecasts become self fulfilling
7311927 the suggestion that any united states administration had the power to influence decisively the course of a tremendous domestic political upheaval in another great country on another side of the globe is simply childish
7311928 thus the general effect of cold war extremism was to delay rather than hasten the great change that overtook the soviet union

7311945 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7311946 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7311947 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7311948 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7311949 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank

7311995 i am gently guided toward transformation into a higher more lifted state
7311996 i am right now connected with the highest and wisest the deepest and truest one with all that is in its wonder and perfection
7311997 its the speakers goal not to have us there if we were there for two months wed pass the energy bill
7311998 i truly believe the majority was misguided they have shifted the focus to consumption
7311999 it was written for the corn and soy bean producers of iowa and illinois
7312000 there are good things in the housing bill therell be oversight on freddie mac and fannie mae reining them in thats a good thing it will modernize fha thats a good thing

7312014 chi si arruola davvero sa che in uno scontro bisogna mettere tutto se stesso
7312015 intento davvero viva hai mai provato quella sensazione di adrenalina pura al cento per cento che ti fa stringere i pugni i denti inarcare le sopracciglia e gridare con tutta la voce che hai in gola e la sensazione che provo quando ho di fronte un ultras avversario o un poliziotto cattiveria allo stato brado odio puro come la neve atala lamore ingannevole lodio no lamore va e viene lodio con il passare degli anni cresce lodio forse il pi vero dei sentimenti
7312016 i veri ultras non sono infami la loro giustizia se la fanno tra loro braccia contro braccia questovuol dire essere ultras non puoi farti un credo con delle immagini tu hai visto degli scontri hai sentito delle voci eppure non sai ancora niente e pretendi di capire capire tutto atala non puoi capire n sentire per davvero cosa vuol dire essere ultras perch non la tua storia e nemmeno riuscirai a capire bene luca o me anche se mi hai visto hai visto dove vado a ficcarmi e se ti dicessi che perch ci credo sarebbe ancora troppo poco
7312017 qui cominciato tutto con lumidit e il puzzo delle cantine qui sono cresciuto imparando ad appartenere a qualcosa e non so non so se potrei raccontartelo con le parole ecco perch forse non te ne ho mai parlato come parlarti di questo cresci e credi che qualcosa cresca con te sotto la pelle e non ti abbandoner mai ti far marciare dritto e orgoglioso verso qualsiasi futuro non importa chi eri se eri ricco povero brutto o balbuziente la curva era davvero tua se riuscivi a conquistarla con i tuoi colori e prometteva di rimanerlo per sempre qui ho imparato a piangere a picchiare a maledire qui ho imparato ad avere amici a cucire gli striscioni con emozione e rispetto pensando a mio padre che ovunque fosse mi avrebbe visto mi avrebbe riconosciuto anche fra mille o pi uomini della curva e sarebbe stato con me sono cresciuto con i ragazzi della fossa con gli ideali della fossa cera il calcio e cera la mia vita cera milano e il sacrificio delle trasferte i soldi risparmiati per pagarci la benzina delle strasferte perch noi eravamo soli senza aiuti dalla societ o almeno provavamo a esserlo mascalzoni schietti ma liberi pronti a pagare pronti ad andare contro essere ultras voleva dire questo per noi ed essere ultras voleva dire curva e i fumogeni che si sollevano fino al cielo tingendo laria
7312018 i do way too many things but i love them all how can i give up any so you

7312021 cease to call slavery wrong and join them in calling it right
7312022 gt diary of a wimpy kid having never been a teenage boy i cant really relate but it sure made me feel sorry for kids nowadays it was a bit like malcom in the middle in stick figures it probably wont be getting a newberry medal or anything but it was cute
7312023 third worldiness living unreservedly in lifes duties problems successes and failures experiences and perplexities in doing so we throw ourselves completely into the arms of god taking seriously not our own sufferings but those of god in the world
7312024 on labor day all union members and their families have an excellent opportunity to come together with a broad range of community groups and movements to call for an end to the war in iraq for the troops to be brought home now and for the funds used for this war to instead be used to meet human needs
7312025 mi a raspuns vezi ca nici asta nu stii ia gandeste te putin
7312026 readers can stop worrying about those questions of obamas inexperience on such matters
7312027 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7312028 they say that our aggression our toughness came out of our slave situation
7312029 considering that jamaica had more slavery rebellion than any country in the world
7312030 its not a question of genetic pool but we have that
7312031 its a cultural thing too that we want to achieve
7312032 i think that he knows full well that his athletes have been using drugs
7312033 he set out to set up a lab to cheat they caught him he went to prison and now hes casting aspersions on other people who have stayed in this sport the last 40 years and have been clean
7312034 from 1948 until now we have been coming to the olympics in sprints ok and we have done well this is just a culmination of what has gone on for more than 40 years
7312035 which is difficult to translate exactly but could be said to mean though we may be small we are powerful beyond expectations
7312036 at the end of the day though there is a culture of track that the jamaicans have now mastered at a very high level
7312037 if usain bolt were born in north america or europe he would be now earning far more money as a professional basketball player with the odds of a much longer and more lucrative career
7312038 once upon a time they were saying we have it because we have fast fibers
7312039 so i said to them how many countries have fast fibers only a few areas in the world ah these are theories that dont hold strong when you have a complex situation
7312040 we passed exams at universities abroad because of the strength where other blacks failed
7312041 we feel because other people are now caught the playing field is now more level for us
7312042 all of them trained in the states and we caught them down in kingston
7312043 you remember that guy who believed in god so strongly
7312044 our athletes are strong believers in the almighty they believe that without the almighty they can do nothing and with the almighty they actually can do everything
7312045 we know that our athletes have trained hard that the country would not tolerate any kind of cheating because we are a moral christian country
7312046 for everyone who poured their time energy and creativity into the making of this project i give my sincerest congratulations

7312051 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7312052 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
7312053 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
7312054 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7312055 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7312056 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7312057 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7312058 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7312059 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7312060 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7312061 that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7312062 for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7312063 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7312064 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7312065 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7312066 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7312067 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7312068 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7312069 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7312070 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7312071 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7312072 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7312073 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7312074 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7312075 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7312076 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7312077 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7312078 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7312079 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7312080 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7312081 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7312082 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7312083 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7312084 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7312085 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7312086 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7312087 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7312088 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7312089 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll
7312090 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7312091 this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit pissed off
7312092 when that dreadful day comes the audience will be ready for it
7312093 the reason the finale of the last series worked so well is that it was top secret
7312094 it s a free country and people are entitled to say this is richard and judy going off into the dim antechamber of television but i would ask them whats the future digital or analogue of course we are going to get smaller audiences but this is the challenge of the moment
7312095 most people are desperate to be famous and would do anything
7312096 it appeals to the mentality of people who stop to watch after an accident
7312097 the wonderful thing about the olympics is seeing people become famous because they have talent what a lovely change
7312098 it is more fulfilling of course because it concerns talent the beatles didnt make it because of me but because of the songs they wrote
7312099 we have had a lot of complaints about the gassing of chicks from the germans this has gone all round the world and the one country that had a problem with it
7312100 i wanted to stand up and say hey after 65 years why do you need to bring that up it was a very unwise thing to say i was shocked
7312101 we work very closely with german tv and the german book publisher and we love all germans
7312102 i was driven to tell a certain kind of story about global consciousness and interconnectivity i asked can people with these powers find each other defeat evil and save the world it was important to have people in the show that werent just blonde haired blue eyed californians
7312103 our relationship with our audience is tenuous but they are passionate intense involved and yes obsessive
7312104 we were friends before we were a couple and were always going to be friends
7312105 we have two amazing kids together kevin is my boy
7312106 because the onset of symptoms of listeriosis can occur up to 70 days after contaminated food is consumed it is expected that the number of confirmed and suspected cases will continue to increase over the next several weeks
7312107 tragically our products have been linked to illness and loss of life
7312108 to those people who are ill and to the families who have lost loved ones i offer my deepest and sincerest sympathies
7312109 loss of airplane pitch control resulting from the in flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assemblys acme nut threads
7312110 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7312111 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7312112 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7312113 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7312114 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7312115 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7312116 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7312117 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7312118 i am looking forward to handing over a gb shirt to kate ellis because they were shocked that we thought we could get anywhere near them in the medal table
7312119 weve beaten them we have got more gold medals and indeed more medals
7312120 general opinion in the party is in favour of parting ways
7312121 we do not want a civilian president with the same powers that musharraf had mainly the power to dissolve parliament
7312122 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday
7312123 i am also willing to contest the presidential election but i am bound to obey what the party decides
7312124 its been something ive always wanted to have in a convention hall

7312210 the opening of the mall at the klia contact pier is expected to boost the revenue further for this year we cant really gauge but we anticipate it to contribute at least 20 per cent to eramans business next year
7312211 we are bringing retail to the next level no airport in the world has a lifestyle approach
7312212 to mitigate any downside we will continue to improve our offerings airport retailing is unique and a niche market as travellers generally buy on impulse and for asians the general purchasing trend is mainly for giftings
7312213 there will be immediate savings in loading time for the palm oil companies due to the tankers payload size our customers can deliver more in less time to their buyers and reduce the number of tankers required to deliver their products
7312214 it would be faster to clear 40 tonnes in one tanker otherwise 1 5 tankers are required to clear the same amount
7312215 two more will arrive soon we are seeking funding to roll out the purchase of the remaining tankers
7312216 we are affected as others fuel is the biggest chunk of our cost we have undertaken cost cutting measures such as relocating our depots and opening new ones closer to our key customer locations to reduce journeys hence better fuel economy
7312217 apart from reviewing our charter rates by 35 to 45 per cent to mitigate higher cost we have beefed up our fleet management system by introducing engine idling time reducing tanker turnaround time increasing tanker usage on weekends and replacing the smaller tankers with bigger ones it will keep the cost at bay
7312218 we are certain we will never dry out of business looking at the potential in malaysia our customers are already asking us to increase the number of super tankers
7312219 ive met him and talked to him he has the desire
7312220 he has a heck of a chance of doing well
7312221 mccain camps overplaying of pow card called to account from all corners
7312222 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7312223 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7312224 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7312225 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7312226 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7312227 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7312228 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever thank you to the people of china
7312229 im an east end boy and im proud that its happening in london i was very proud to be involved in the first place bringing it back to england and to london its going to generate so much interest in sport and kids are already getting excited about it we have seen what the chinese have done here and im sure we will better that without a doubt

7312237 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7312238 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7312239 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7312240 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7312241 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7312242 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7312243 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7312244 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7312245 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7312246 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7312247 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7312248 who are open to doing something on the production side
7312249 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7312250 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7312251 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7312252 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7312253 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7312254 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7312255 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7312256 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7312257 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7312258 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7312259 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7312260 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7312261 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7312262 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7312263 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7312264 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7312265 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7312266 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7312267 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7312268 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7312269 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7312270 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7312271 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7312272 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7312273 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7312274 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7312275 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7312276 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7312277 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7312278 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7312279 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7312280 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7312281 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7312282 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7312283 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7312284 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7312285 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7312286 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7312287 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7312288 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7312289 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7312290 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7312291 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7312292 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7312293 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7312294 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

7312317 this meeting will certainly improve better understanding as we have discussed some very contemporary and contentious issues
7312318 it was an individual aberration not an organisational attempt it is highly regrettable
7312319 we will examine the list and give it to the home ministry
7312320 we have identified some 46 spots and handed over a list to the bdr for its position on that
7312321 docs and local police are still looking to find the family
7312322 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms five pounds eight ounces and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
7312323 itll be something thatll have to be assessed once that child is located
7312324 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
7312325 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms five pounds eight ounces and they give the same dose to babies twice his size
7312326 we do the same thing if we have a jehovahs witness parent who is refusing to allow their child to have a blood transfusion or a hiv positive mother who does not agree to her baby being given hiv drugs we need to look after the childs rights
7312327 docs and local police are still looking to find the family
7312328 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms five pounds eight ounces and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
7312329 itll be something thatll have to be assessed once that child is located
7312330 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
7312331 we are talking a potentially major and awful outcome for this child and it is our job to protect children when they cant make decisions for themselves
7312332 docs and local police are still looking to find the family
7312333 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms five pounds eight ounces and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
7312334 itll be something thatll have to be assessed once that child is located
7312335 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
7312336 we are talking a potentially major and awful outcome for this child and it is our job to protect children when they cant make decisions for themselves
7312337 and youve thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled fear to bring children into the world for threatening my baby unborn and un named you aint worth the blood that flows through your viens
7312338 again i tell you that if two of you on earth agree on anything you ask for it will be done for you by my father in heaven for where two or three come together in my name there am i with them
7312339 and youve thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled fear to bring children into the world for threatening my baby unborn and un named you aint worth the blood that flows through your viens
7312340 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
7312341 im trying to help you i guess that makes me evil
7312342 yeah they did that to prisoners being executed because they were going ot die anyway then there was corruption then they put a stop to it
7312343 we are trying to ensure the release of madam khaleda zia through higher courts since she made it clear that she would not apply for getting release on parole or on the basis of executive order
7312344 we do not want a civilian president with the same powers that musharraf had mainly the power to dissolve parliament
7312345 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday
7312346 the alliance is intact today but its future depends on the fulfilment of the promise zardari made for the restoration of the judges
7312347 we the four party alliance have rejected the ordinance rpo the next parliamentary elections will be illegal if it is held under this ordinance
7312348 its like serving old wine in a new bottle which a caretaker government or the election commission doesnt have any jurisdiction to do it only an elected parliament can enact such a law
7312349 such conditions are not acceptable to khaleda zia and even the people wont accept those
7312350 the commission is definitely going to extend the deadline by another month after september 1 initially set by the commission
7312351 yes there is a possibility of extending the time by one month it will be announced later on
7312352 the hearings will begin soon maybe within a week or so
7312353 we have shortage of fishes against the increasing demand as the water bodies drying out day by day
7312354 the water bodies also being filled up for the establishment of industries and other purposes
7312355 we have also taken steps to promulgate the national shrimp ordinance within three months for the development of this important sector
7312356 we have 807 species of fishes of the species 260 are sweet water fishes and rest of them marine fishes
7312357 i knew how good aiden was when i left but he has improved a hell of a lot
7312358 aiden has pretty much everything now the final delivery the shot or pass he has that end product to his game now
7312359 and he scares the life out of defenders when he starts running at them if the players make runs ahead of him then he will find them
7312360 the pace of the team as we are breaking is different from when i was last here especially with some of the attacking players we have
7312361 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7312362 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7312363 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7312364 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7312365 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7312366 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7312367 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7312368 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7312369 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7312370 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7312371 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7312372 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7312373 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7312374 senator obama had a great conversation with senator clinton this week as well as former president bill clinton everybodys on board
7312375 and its going to drive the media crazy when we come out of this convention united hillary clinton joe biden everybody that ran for this office is going to be united
7312376 you could fill your whole show with the nasty things that john mccain and mitt romney said about each other just a few months ago
7312377 the first person that he sat down and talked to at all about this vice presidential issue was senator clinton alone
7312378 they can run any attack ad they want but heres the issue americans want a change in the direction of this nation
7312379 joes a guy who grew up in a working class household they both understand the experience that americans are going through now
7312380 by the end of the campaign when she had really connected with american voters particularly working class voters i think she was having a great time
7312381 joe is only known by political insiders by the eastern half of pennsylvania and by delaware
7312382 i dont think thats a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer then we have something to talk about
7312383 im prepared to preside over legislation that will take a comprehensive approach
7312384 include that drilling let it compete and see where we come down on it and if that in fact is a good alternative then that is something that we should do
7312385 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7312386 actually the first part of my comment was just thrown in to make people like you mad
7312387 he also has an occasional tendency to stick his foot in his mouth
7312388 hey lets make obama and biden join forces oh the mind bwahahahah double think you goyim double think
7312389 we want the announcement of dates of election of all components of the senate immediately by removing the pro vc and the treasurer recruited during the government of the four party alliance for their ill attempts and irregularities galore at the university
7312390 the proctor and the assistant proctors are taking handsome money every month without discharging their duties on the days of examinations
7312391 when we started people told us we dont know any jewish people
7312392 its always helpful to teach other people what you know
7312393 theres a lot of jews who just dont know how to express it
7312394 i was feeling really kind of cynical but this this was great
7312395 we never rest theres always more people to meet and things to do
7312396 the accenture chicago triathlon the worlds largest triathlon has hosted many olympic triathletes
7312397 we are known as a great competition and the place to be if you are a top triathlete racing the international distance
7312398 chicago is one of triathlons greatest stages and with the windy city vying as a finalist to host the 2016 summer olympic games our world class event is definitely the one to watch
7312399 especially when theres police cars around as its bloody terrifying
7312400 the challenge has nothing to do with gender the challenge has to do with coming to a new part of the world and learning a new culture a new language in part because i dont speak maori at the moment and learning to steer the good ship christchurch wherever god would have her sail

7312414 ha sido un evento deportivo espectacular pero se celebraron ante las violaciones de los derechos humanos puesto que se impidi que los activistas expresasen de manera pac fica sus puntos de vista
7312415 las autoridades chinas y el coi ten an una oportunidad de demostrar la mejora de los derechos humanos pero en muchos aspectos fracasaron
7312416 the obama desire to get out and the mccain desire to succeed could be coming together in the form of an ability to get out while succeeding
7312417 the simple truth is that we do not have sufficient forces in iraq to meet our military objectives
7312418 facts have to affect your decision making and over the course of 16 months things are going to constantly change
7312419 he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq even today with victory in sight
7312420 due giorni dopo larrivo del free gaza e del liberty accolti da un festoso benvenuto a gaza tra 20 e 25 degli osservatori per i diritti umani andranno in mare con i pescatori per mostrare sostegno alla lotta per mantenere produttiva la loro attivit secondo un recente articolo del guardian
7312421 nel 1990 lattivit di pesca a gaza produceva un ricavo annuale di circa 5 milioni di sterline nel 2007 si era dimezzato e si sta ancora riducendo velocemente secondo gli accordi di oslo che nel 1993 si supponeva preannunciassero lavvento di uno stato palestinese indipendente i pescatori di gaza avrebbero potuto percorrere 20 miglia marine verso il mare aperto v immagine a sinistra mappa allegata allaccordo per gaza e gerico del 1994 dove avrebbero potuto prendere le sardine migranti dal delta del nilo verso la turchia in primavera ma negli anni recenti le navi della marina israeliana hanno imposto i loro limiti assai ridotti qualche volta a meno di 6 miglia
7312422 cosa d a israele il diritto di togliere il sostentamento a questi pescatori e perch il mondo permette loro di distruggere unattivit che serviva a mantenere migliaia di palestinesi
7312423 noi intendiamo sfidare quel diritto sostenuto da navi da guerra e mitragliatrici proprio come abbiamo sfidato il diritto di israele di impedire il nostro approdo qui sabato

7312446 i woke up in my bed with a gun to my head
7312447 the guy told me if you move im going to kill you
7312448 i couldnt see the gun i felt it it was a rifle or single barrel shotgun then he started asking where the money was
7312449 after it happened i realized i was robbed at gunpoint
7312450 she said it looks like people had keys to get into the house
7312451 complt complainant reports on above d t l date time and location 2 b ms black males did enter house once inside did threaten complts with handgun demanding cash suspects did take 2 x boxes video games and 1 laptop and complts cellphone complt cannot id there was no sign of force entering
7312452 he said theres nothing we can do there was no breaking and entering
7312453 the detective said that takes too much time and money
7312454 if someone was to grade that paper on grammar alone he the detective would have failed
7312455 everyone wants to go to homicide but if you want to learn to be a detective this is the best place to learn interviewing skills
7312456 we rarely have evidence on these suspects so you have to become their friend and talk to them
7312457 detectives spend hours and hours talking to suspects and eventually they break down
7312458 the gods honest truth is that i wouldnt rather be anywhere but st louis thats where i was hoping to go
7312459 last year i tested out as the second strongest player on the team my strength has been questioned but i try and prove it
7312460 i dont listen to what the experts say its what the rams say i knew i had the talent to be the first wide receiver picked
7312461 the goal is to do everything the coach tells me to do every day compete and make plays and if they feel like im fit to be ready to play in september then i am
7312462 the main nickname was the ram killer thats what the seattle people called me and i guess thats what some of them called me here but no longer
7312463 the window is only so big and i realize im getting towards the end of that i still enjoy playing i still enjoy the whole experience of it
7312464 this is a fun way to meet and greet our fans
7312465 we take pride in our accessibility and our community involvement and we feel good about showing the community what our program is all about
7312466 obviously its just been tremendously more challenging its only human nature if youre being shot at from one angle the energy is on trying to survive
7312467 every city has had its big twist on the games what they have thats different to every other county
7312468 the olympic movement is about bringing the world together im not sure what that difference will be but im looking forward to seeing what it is and how this city develops
7312469 we will draw on our wit flair imagination and ingenuity to build on what weve all witnessed in beijing and deliver a fantabulous olympics in what i consider to be not only my home but the home of sport
7312470 im london born and bred and i think it will do really big things for the city
7312471 the next summer games return to a country which i frequently boast has either invented or codified just about every major world sport
7312472 when i left it was all recession recession recession and weve come back to a country overwhelmed by olympic success
7312473 theres an overwhelming sense of people being excited by the next olympics being in london
7312474 assess the actual situation in tibet and let the world know the truth
7312475 fighting is still going on we hit and destroyed over 40 militants bunkers and a training camp
7312476 we have confirmed reports that 50 militants were killed while 10 of our soldiers were martyred
7312477 except for some few mps who are in hiding all our elected 100 members of parliament should be there on monday
7312478 no withdrawal has been mentioned today the russians are keeping all their previous illegal checkpoints
7312479 people are coming back bit by bit still not everyone is back but we are getting back to normal
7312480 but we are still scared how can we be sure there is not going to be another war the russian troops have only gone back 10 kilometres outside the city
7312481 picked somebody who has unparalleled expertise on foreign policy somebody who will help him rebuild the economy put people back to work make our country independent of energy
7312482 were comfortable with our pick we had a lot of great choices and we talked to a lot of different people but i think we settled on a great pick and a great partnership to bring about change in this country

7312495 the first open media site where anyone can report from anywhere
7312496 it should stimulate a conversation about the responsible use of alcohol
7312497 abuse or non abuse of alcohol is not always a matter of age it is common sense and maturity
7312498 otterbein recognizes the merit of the united methodist position that abstinence is a responsible form of christian love and witness
7312499 the college believes that the consumption of alcoholic beverages enhances neither the educational process nor the quality of life the otterbein community functions on the basis of mutual trust and responsibility and the consumption of alcoholic beverages is potentially disruptive of this educational environment
7312500 at the risk of over generalizing many college age students are at one extreme or the other they drink to get drunk or they dont drink
7312501 we lost against two teams the u s and china we had beaten in qualifying matches if we were to play them again you never know the result because so many of the teams are of the same level
7312502 the bronze medal is not gold but in spite of that it still has a lot of value it will be so nice if there could be two bronze medals but there is only one
7312503 the bronze medal does not come easily its the unity of the whole team that sent us through i have no regret and this is the most honorable moment in my life
7312504 i cant describe my feeling now its hard to say good bye because i have been with this team for eight years none of the medals is more important than a team fighting side by side i hope the young players will carry on this team spirit
7312505 they were so hopeless that i believed they gave up at the third set
7312506 but today i saw perseverance on them again the most valuable quality which i think helped them win the athens gold and will help to overcome the adversities to be stronger in the future
7312507 in this aspect the bronze medal means much more than the gold medal
7312508 some coaches even cried when we were trying to find out why we lost let alone the girls we have too much pressure as our mission to enter the final but we didnt injuries and low spirit hampered us and i also failed to help the girls have a proper attitude towards win and lose
7312509 my dream is to win the gold but im satisfied with the result today as we finally overcame setbacks over the past four years especially the past two weeks and the girls really did a good job today
7312510 el balance es excelente hace un mes hab a muchos detalles que pulir y mejorar y se ha hecho un esfuerzo bestial pero la imagen que hoy ha dado valencia al mundo ha sido espectacular charlie whaiting ha empleado esta palabra para definir el gran premio

7312568 felipe has had an extraordinary weekend yesterday he was very quick in qualifying and today he drove in impeccable style without putting a foot wrong to take what was a very well deserved win after the disappointment of budapest i want to compliment him and the whole team who have worked so hard in preparing for this event unfortunately once again we have suffered with a reliability problem this time on kimis car which lost us precious points now we have to find out what happened in yet another engine failure and then decide how to react clearly what happened is serious and we will have to do all in our power to make up for the ground we have lost through reliability problems in the coming races now we must continue to push to the maximum to develop the car and improve reliability in order to be as well prepared as possible for the forthcoming races we still have two test sessions at monza and then jerez and a lot of hard days work in the factory finally i want to say a few words about piero timpini our mechanic unfortunately injured in kimis second pit stop his first words were to say sorry as though the incident was his fault it is thanks to the passion dedication and professionalism that these guys show on a daily basis for ferrari how special is our team
7312569 its fantastic having won this race especially after the disappointment of budapest the team did an amazing job in preparing for this grand prix and the benefits of that could be seen right from the very first day yesterday i got pole and today the win with the race fastest lap as the icing on the cake you cannot ask for more especially at my one hundredth grand prix with every single one of them powered by a ferrari engine i got a good start and i pushed to the maximum right from the early laps in the second part of the race the car was exceptional but also in the final stint when i had the softer tyres i could do the lap times easily this is an important moment in my career and i must continue to work in this way i am sorry for what happened to kimi we have to look very carefully at our reliability i am confident the team knows which countermeasures to take to react to this issue as it has always done in the past
7312570 not much to say after a day like this it was definitely not the weekend i was hoping for but i do not believe that despite this negative result i am now out of the running for the title there are still six races to go and sixty points up for grabs we have seen that the situation change really quickly even if i realize things are now more complicated today i lost a place at the start and i was stuck in traffic for all of the first stint then when i had a clear track ahead of me i was able to push and was doing good lap times at the second pit stop i made a mistake and left before i should have done fortunately pietro timpini is not too badly hurt i wish him all the best and hope he gets better soon in any case it would not have changed anything as then the engine broke now we must concentrate on preparing for the next rounds and on improving our qualifying performance
7312571 i wasnt mad but i just said id like to get a score
7312572 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7312573 thats because he is still that scrappy kid from scranton who beat the odds the dedicated family man and committed catholic who knows every conductor on that amtrak train to wilmington
7312574 is genuinely a friend of mine ive known john for 35 years
7312575 and during those 18 months i must tell you frankly
7312576 i have been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and gave in to the swift boat politics he once so deplored
7312577 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about
7312578 its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7312579 i once heard of a man so rich he didnt know his kids were in college the story was a joke but sen john mccain republican presidential nominee to be brought it back to mind when he forgot how many houses he owns
7312580 in a new tv ad and at a speech in
7312581 whats in a house or seven hahahahahahaha the real issue here is not how rich the candidates happen to be finalists in the presidential race are by their very nature elites having risen to the top through education wealth connections or foxlike cunning
7312582 the real issue is whether they are elitists in other words are they in touch with your deeply felt values and urgent concerns dear voter or do they think theyre better than you and do they show it

7312608 they that turn the world upside down are come here also
7312609 living at home with your parents is a very powerful contraception
7312610 its about how much the man participates in child care
7312611 what dominates is the issue of gender equity and that in turn raises the fertility level for example there is a debate right now about whether to make paternity leave compulsory its an issue of making sure women and men have equal rights and opportunities if men are taking leave after the birth of a child the women can return to work for part of that time
7312612 the age gap between generations is widening and in many cases grandparents who would be the ones relied upon for child care themselves become the ones in need of care
7312613 we have to accept we have lost some big players who are difficult to replace but the boss knows what hes doing for me arsenal is arsenal and this club has something special that no others have we have to take care of it thats why you have to be intelligent in your decisions
7312614 i have friends in spain in italy and they speak to me about other clubs and i know that im privileged to be where i am and i dont want to lose it im still young i want to win things for the club i want to get experience and i want to compete because when you see football around the world you see very few teams that play the way that we play and i just enjoy the way we play
7312615 i came here when i was 16 and i feel its my home now i think i will be lucky to be here as long as i can to play for arsenal i dont even want to think about whether i would find a similar environment elsewhere because im happy where i am whenever people say another team is the best in the world i know where i am and how i feel here which is the most important thing

7312621 lo que hay que hacer es ayudar al gobierno a aplicar las medidas innovadoras que est ejecutando de manera inmediata y urgente

7312624 pese a que el impacto a corto plazo en el reino unido es m nimo est n ocurriendo cosas que resultan preocupantes desde el punto de vista de este pa s y que constituyen una amenaza potencial a medio o largo plazo

7312628 in spite of that the impact in the short term in the united kingdom is minimal there happen things that turn out to be worrying from the point of view of these country and that constitute a potential threat to average half or long term
7312629 displeasing towards the south these are more accessible geographically to the countries angl fonos of the region as gambia ghana nigeria sierra leone and liberia which populations have narrower links with the united kingdom and which are already in different degrees sources fountains of irregular migrations to this country
7312630 this route route the canaries it she is cheaper and rapid than different as the one that goes from lybia to italy or the one that uses the air transport
7312631 the new comer of singhalese and paquistan es indicates that dealers who operate from more remote regions are exploring also this route
7312632 nos dejaron entender que el destino era madrid o m laga
7312633 nos despertaron a las tres de la madrugada en el centro de acogida de tenerife y nos dejaron entender en el momento de embarcar que el destino nuestro era madrid o m laga
7312634 estamos muy decepcionados pues el regreso forzoso a senegal acaba con nuestra esperanza de una vida mejor y el deseo de poder ser tiles a nuestro familia y nuestro pa s
7312635 they woke us up at three oclock in the morning in the center of reception of tenerife and left us to deal in the moment to embark that our destiny was madrid or malaga

7312649 i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life

7312651 hoeveel wil je er voor hebben en wat is de grote van de trommel vroeg ze me dus via email
7312652 it is very hard some days to know which way is up
7312653 to be nobody but yourself in a world which is working night and day to make you like everybody else means to fight the hardest battle any human being can fight and never stop fighting
7312654 unconditional love does not require sacrificing self pride yes self never
7312655 the secret lies in being brave enough everyday to embrace the truth that whispers constantly from within
7312656 my friendship is eternal my ability to care at all costs is immeasurable my heart soul and spirits depth belong to only one man i am a woman of truth even in my humanness and i will always be perfectly flawed

7312661 overall i think a year from now we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course
7312662 we will win this conflict we will win it easily
7312663 wanted to change the republican party platform to protect abortion rights in cases of rape and incest now he doesnt
7312664 im committed to making sure that theres equal pay for equal work that is my record and you can count on it
7312665 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues i still need to be educated
7312666 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
7312667 read my lips candidate no new taxes no matter what
7312668 im not making a read my lips statement in that i will not raise taxes
7312669 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country

7312681 passione perch colpa di quella se ti ho fatto diventare un mostro assetato di sangue
7312682 no passione perch quella che ha legato per sempre il nostro rapporto quel sentimento che ha fatto s che restassimo insieme per leternit quel sentimento che ha deciso di non farci perdere lun laltro quel sentimento senza il quale non esisterebbe lamore vero sai che senza passione non pu esserci vero amore
7312683 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7312684 i think that whitney will do really well with it she is a very likable person
7312685 as far as i know ive just been filming for a fourth season of the hills
7312686 im sorry i wasted your time i sat down thinking this would be deeper and more poetic that it actually was
7312687 responsibly appropriately and in the best interests of patient safety
7312688 safety is our primary concern always with the development of any new treatment
7312689 they didnt explain to the parents that this was an experimental vaccine and a lot of the parents who signed consent forms were illiterate
7312690 in some cases they first gave them the vaccine and then gave them a 13 page consent form to sign that i had to read three times to understand
7312691 while legal authorities investigate were in an observation phase to see if everything happened as expected or if there were deviations that caused damage in this case the death of seven kids
7312692 the analysis in this paper assumes that the entire observed change in heart attacks is attributable to the smoking ban
7312693 one cannot rule out the very plausible alternative hypothesis that the observed decline in heart attacks is explained by random variation in the data and the already existing secular trend of declining heart attacks in scotland
7312694 we might even say that the smoking ban caused a rise in heart attacks in wales
7312695 the issue is do not expect to get to the end of the day and have enough money from prevention savings to pay for the uninsured
7312696 for example drugs used to treat high cholesterol yield much greater value for the money if the targeted population is at high risk for coronary heart disease
7312697 in todays world where the rate of medical care inflation is twice the rate of regular inflation anything done 10 years from now is in real dollars 25 percent more expensive
7312698 keep people as healthy as possible as long as possible so that they dont spend as much money being sick
7312699 have early old age last as long as possible and late old age last 15 minutes

7312707 after much ado the eraserheads concert is most definitely pushing through philip morris and its brands have pulled out from the concert but another company is taking over the production they have already started work on the site in the fort
7312708 unfortunately the concert is no longer free registrations at the red nation site are now void an official announcement and ticketing details will come out in major newspapers and on the radio on tuesday
7312709 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
7312710 its becoming time to give some credit to the in ring efforts of mark henry
7312711 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
7312712 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
7312713 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
7312714 when you were younger did you set an ideal age to marry

7312718 gordon brown is determined to put on the biggest and best rock show the world has ever witnessed
7312719 music and the cultural aspects of the games will be very important as we move forward to 2012
7312720 in all these areas where our creativity is leading the world i think we will want to showcase that to the world when they look in on london in 2012
7312721 britain is the home of football we gave it to the world and i hope there will be a team in 2012
7312722 like so many people around the world i have followed their endeavours with great interest and admiration to all the participants and to everyone who has supported them so well i send my warmest congratulations
7312723 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympics the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7312724 football is the best sport in the world so it should be top of the list
7312725 i will be 37 in four years time so im not sure i will still be playing but you never know
7312726 i think hes great he is so talented and has got so much confidence its such a big stage and the whole world is watching so if you can perform like he has then you deserve to gloat
7312727 we are the champions after the orderly precision of the beijing olympics it was time on sunday for a first look at what organizers hope will be the fun of london 2012
7312728 every city has had its big twist on the games what they have thats different to every other county said swim star michael phelps who was at the london show
7312729 the olympic movement is about bringing the world together im not sure what that difference will be but im looking forward to seeing what it is and how this city develops
7312730 we will draw on our wit flair imagination and ingenuity to build on what weve all witnessed in beijing and deliver a fantabulous olympics in what i consider to be not only my home but the home of sport london mayor boris johnson said from beijing
7312731 i cant believe theyre really here said 14 year old mcfly fan lisa evans who said she had arrived at 7 30 a
7312732 im london born and bred and i think it will do really big things for the city singer sophie ellis bextor said after singing james bond theme
7312733 give it to me gesture as he waited to grab the flag
7312734 the next summer games return to a country which i frequently boast has either invented or codified just about every major world sport johnson said
7312735 when i left it was all recession recession recession and weve come back to a country overwhelmed by olympic success wiggins said
7312736 theres an overwhelming sense of people being excited by the next olympics being in london
7312737 you dont need to show the world your cooter to get respect a little cleavage and butt cheek is more than enough
7312738 you can forget in the emotion of winning about the country and what that means
7312739 we did it the whole tournament put our hands over our hearts i didnt want any slippage because it wasnt over yet
7312740 in terms of all the measures that we look at our athletes behavior their reception in the country the medal production how this has captured the attention and reinvigorated the olympic movement in the united states all those make this at least since the 1984 los angeles olympics our best performance ever
7312741 were going to have to re double our efforts in future games
7312742 we need to focus and mesh sports where we really dont show up
7312743 the way the athletes have carried themselves and respected their opponents respected our flag the other flags i think the u s olympic team has delivered a message of friendship and respect and at the same time been furiously competitive thats what we need
7312744 the olympics are about good timing good luck good preparation and good execution
7312745 dropping a baton isnt bad luck its bad execution responsibility for the relay debacle lies with many people and many groups from administration to coaches to athletes
7312746 our performance across the board in team sports in these games may be the best ever
7312747 we will not abandon those sports in an attempt to earn medals in individual sports which sometimes may be less expensive
7312748 this team that probably a year ago no one would consider to be worthy of being olympic champions has come out and proved everyone wrong
7312749 i just realized this is silly to keep paying this much
7312750 you have to have a cell these days but you dont have to pay ridiculous prices

7312765 our party will fight to the finish to get the land back
7312766 the government acquired 997 acres of land for the project the project needs about 600 acres
7312767 it is totally impractical to give back the land as demanded returning the 400 acres means scrapping the entire project

7312782 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7312783 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7312784 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7312785 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7312786 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7312787 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7312788 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7312789 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7312790 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7312791 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7312792 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track

7312799 i knew how good aiden was when i left but he has improved a hell of a lot
7312800 aiden has pretty much everything now the final delivery the shot or pass he has that end product to his game now
7312801 and he scares the life out of defenders when he starts running at them if the players make runs ahead of him then he will find them
7312802 the pace of the team as we are breaking is different from when i was last here especially with some of the attacking players we have
7312803 i just realized this is silly to keep paying this much

7312808 any man who is under 30 and is not a liberal has not heart and any man who is over 30 and is not a conservative has no brains
7312809 an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last
7312810 if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was and never will be
7312811 the day that this country ceases to be free for irreligion it will cease to be free for religion except for the sect that can win political power
7312812 a government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away
7312813 on two occasions i have been asked pray mr babbage if you put into the machine wrong figures will the right answers come out i am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question

7312824 it was evening around the time for the last prayer when armed men came and took my son islamuddin by force i have eye witness statements from nine people that he was there from that night until now my son has never been seen
7312825 the commander and three of his fighters came and took my wife out of our home and took her to their house about 200 metres away and in front of these witnesses raped her
7312826 there are difficulties were rebuilding institutions including our justice institutions and there are shortcomings but the president and the government are committed to the rule of law on all equally
7312827 theyre in the government karzai the americans the british sit down with them they have impunity theyve become very courageous and can do whatever crimes they like
7312828 at the end of the day my mom said you played here for nine years give the family back home a chance to see you live
7312829 she said if you sign there for three years youll still only be 34 and maybe you can still finish in edmonton
7312830 the west is tougher boogaard brian mcgrattan is in phoenix now jody shelley raitis ivanans los angeles hordichuk d j king st louis roy scott parker colorado
7312831 the east has some older guys like brash donald brashear and wade belak they only will fight because they feel they have to the west has younger guys who like doing it
7312832 they were very generous on pay they take care of everything
7312833 they treat you like a king life is good it was a great great experience
7312834 it was a ton of fun believe it or not hockey is really pretty decent over there i would say probably a little bit below the american league
7312835 i believe weve identified a number of things we can do to strengthen that situation and no 1 is putting a winning team on the ice and getting people back into the building
7312836 we have a great team of people down there right now coach ken hitchcock general manager scott howson and president mike priest im very comfortable with their vision to build this franchise to mold this club from the ground up
7312837 they got most of the players they wanted this summer in free agency and in the draft
7312838 the level of engagement that people wanted to have with him will be less so with me im guessing
7312839 i understood it early in life there can be only one founder the rest of us have to find our niche
7312840 what do we do to get this team to the other level
7312841 it was clear the russian born defenseman did not live up to expectations after signing a three year 5 4 million deal as a free agent last summer
7312842 lamoriello has suggested he would like to add another defenseman in addition to giving young players like matthew corrente a shot at making the team and this could open a little salary space to swing a trade for a more established defenseman
7312843 agiu mais agressivamente que muitos dos bancos centrais no mundo
7312844 se meirelles e outros agora s o falc es aqueles que s o a favor de uma abordagem mais agressiva contra a infla o isso porque h n o muito tempo o brasil estava perdendo a luta
7312845 durante uma das muitas lutas passadas do brasil contra a infla o henrique meirelles lembra ele e sua empregada tinham um acordo no dia do pagamento ela n o precisava trabalhar dessa forma ela podia correr at o mercado e gastar todo o sal rio do m s antes que ele se tornasse sem valor
7312846 these were men who had been sentenced and found guilty by the supreme court walking around freely
7312847 it was evening around the time for the last prayer when armed men came and took my son islamuddin by force i have eye witness statements from nine people that he was there from that night until now my son has never been seen
7312848 the commander and three of his fighters came and took my wife out of our home and took her to their house about 200 metres away and in front of these witnesses raped her
7312849 there are difficulties were rebuilding institutions including our justice institutions and there are shortcomings but the president and the government are committed to the rule of law on all equally
7312850 theyre in the government karzai the americans the british sit down with them they have impunity theyve become very courageous and can do whatever crimes they like

7312861 what are you going to do come home to an empty house every night
7312862 people are friends and theyre honest people but situations change
7312863 you have to do this with a person you trust
7312864 i knew he wouldnt sacrifice paying the mortgage to do other things and he had to trust that i had enough money saved
7312865 if i were married it would be much easier to say i like this
7312866 if you put your trust in me i will stand up at that convention and say our divisions are behind us our hope for the future and our time to change has come
7312867 obama cannot win this election alone obama wants people to get involved in the process and has created opportunities for people to volunteer and get involved
7312868 so while the deadline is between now and august 15th you really want to volunteer before that deadline to increase your chances of getting a ticket
7312869 they are trying to make the process as fair as they could
7312870 your hair is so pretty susie and he softly stroked my head
7312871 no he did not we just saw him he is not dead

7312875 i dont think any one can prepare for this role
7312876 its a lot of long hours seven days a week but you know what youre so busy you dont realize how crazy it is and its just getting crazier so
7312877 everyone said look were going to do this we think it is the right thing to open up this convention to the people of colorado and to the people of the country and to give them the opportunity to participate
7312878 people were a little overwhelmed at first but i think as we evolved as a team together and started planning this out we definitely realized that we could pull this off
7312879 it was fun watching teammates getting tossed into the river especially after they bragged how great they would be
7312880 most people throw very very sharp elbows to get a seat at the table and thats not matts style
7312881 hes quiet so people underestimate him underestimating him could be the biggest mistake that people can make
7312882 one of the things is having been on the obama staff during the primaries doing politics he knows who needs what who needs to be stroked more who needs little extra care there
7312883 he knows that all delegates are equal but some delegates are more equal than others
7312884 you cant plan for every option or any problem that might come up
7312885 but we have a really crack team a very talented team with years of convention experience theyve left no detail unturned
7312886 im not going to get into details of those conversations
7312887 the spark of potential consciousness embedded at that biological instant probably drew energy from these environs from where else could it come
7312888 present the new as if it was old like gandhi

7312942 es ist immer rgerlich wenn man 2 0 f hrt und dann noch unentschieden spielt aber das 1 2 ist einfach zu schnell gefallen
7312943 wir h tten nat rlich 2 0 in f hrung gehen m ssen es hat in der ein oder anderen situation die letzte durchschlagskraft gefehlt dennoch haben wir insgesamt eine ordentliche leistung geboten
7312944 das war ein spiel zu dem wir in der ersten stunde nichts beigetragen haben in den letzten 30 minuten lief es dann besser insofern bin ich mit dem punkt zufrieden

7312948 the athletes were never expected to carry the water for the activists it is a matter of individual conscience
7312949 ultimately it is more of an indictment of the atmosphere of intimidation and censorship imposed by the chinese government not to mention the confusing messages
7312950 id suspect a major reason for this is that olympic athletes see the games as a once in lifetime opportunity to shine in their sport stand out and possibly cash in
7312951 its a moment that theyve been training and preparing for all their lives and to risk tarnishing all their hard work with a protest or political statement just isnt worth it
7312952 the goal was not to stick a finger in chinas eye but rather to raise world consciousness about how china underwrites mass slaughter as a way to urge the international community to intercede with beijing

7312990 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7312991 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7312992 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7312993 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7312994 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it

7313047 one day we did 36 in one day basically me running up and down the beach tagging other peoples fish
7313048 theres no legal obligation to report a tag or throw a fish back id just hope theyd report back to me where they caught it
7313049 im pleased about the declaration and grateful to president bush
7313050 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7313051 i dont know just a plane it was on the radio
7313052 we took 2nd avenue all the way down upon arrival towers one and two were both ablaze the second plane had hit the second tower already both towers were totally engulfed people were jumping out of the buildings there was airplane fuselage and landing gear around the site body parts victims remains on the floor there were some injuries on the street some cars were on fire
7313053 we did see part of i didnt see it but jeff johnson told me later on he did see part of the landing gear actually fell right through the roof and it was in one of the jacuzzis in another room
7313054 we parked on west street and i guess about albany west street and albany got out of the car and started going up west street and there were body parts in the street
7313055 when we passed 10 and 10 theres a bridge that runs i guess into one of the buildings directly south of trade center no 2 theres a pedestrian walkway as we passed that we came into the debris field
7313056 an explosion goes off actually this was the second plane impact rep i immediately tell everyone to get out of the car and hide somewhere go underneath something its interesting because as we were there there was a police car i guess on vesey on the corner there and some debris comes down from whatever this explosion was at the time we really didnt know and it just crushes it i mean crushes the top front of the police car which really scared me at that point q could you tell if it was airplane parts a it looked like an airplane part afterward yes it did it looked like part of an engine it was pretty big it was probably the size of the hood because it kind of hit it bounced and then rolled off
7313057 we heard the plane briefly the earth shook the buildings shook a tremendous fireball overhead i thought there was a bomb or an explosion
7313058 i figured as long as we didnt get hit by the plane we were ahead of the game the next thing i was worried about was getting hit by the parts
7313059 the four of us got out of the car we started to cross broadway and the second plane went into the other tower
7313060 by the time we got near 2 world trade center people were jumping off the roof like crazy landing near the hotel and the street was littered with body parts i dont know if it was from the plane or what but there was just body parts all over the place chunks of meat
7313061 i saw airplane parts on west street q how did you know they were airplane parts a it looked like pieces of a plane skin of a plane i mean they werent really discernible i couldnt say this was this part of a plane or that was that part just knowing a plane had hit the building and i looked and i saw it looked like the skin off a wing or a fuselage or wherever it came from q clearly not building material a no the building material was sort of gray and you could see it you know how it differed from the plane
7313062 the other thing that was actually evident though is what appeared to be some plane parts like some circular pieces of a plane and lots of shoes i dont know if that was women jumping out of their jumping out of their heels to run but there were just impressed me there were no you know there were no injuries on the street at that point but there was lots of shoes all over the place and plane parts it was the same thing in both directions
7313063 we just passed a compact car where the engine was running and the door was open which looked to me like the driver had escaped
7313064 there were people dead people everywhere dont know if you want to know that what did you do you know you can say it whatever you saw you know they the people were just
7313065 our initial response was seeing body parts and airplane parts all over the west side just traumatic to see
7313066 we were coming across and we walked down we had to go down to the command center we carried all our tools the bottles everything and as were walking down
7313067 like i remember walking by with the chief and i remember seeing the airplane engine you know pieces of you know obviously trade center all over
7313068 i parked soon thereafter on west street geared up and walked along west street
7313069 once we started taking off i guess 30 feet in front of us there was a lady on the ground by the curb and she was just waving her arms thats all she could wave her legs were crushed apparently she got hit by part of the landing gear one of the tires of the airplane there was a large tire next to her the person who was next to her i guess worked with her said something hit her it may have been the landing gear it was a large piece of metal that was so sharp it slit her whole back open buttocks her legs were exposed bones we boarded her as fast as we could there was nowhere to grab her she was too slippery so i grabbed the hip bone that was exposed we just kind of picked her up put her on the long board and we strapped her up put her on the stretcher and took as much flesh as we could it was just hanging all over the place put it between her legs put her in the ambulance and rushed her to beekman
7313070 a study of some issues raised in a paper by wood amp reynolds
7313071 plaintiffs claim that a terrorist attack was not responsible for the destruction of the world trade center complex
7313072 the defendants knowingly participated in the fraud of furthering the false claim that two wide body jetliners hit the world trade center on 9 11 01
7313073 all defendants moved to dismiss the lawsuits as being frivolous and for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim pursuant to fed r civ p 12 b 1 and 6 respectively the motions to dismiss are granted and all three complaints are dismissed with prejudice
7313074 plaintiffs maintain that the alleged fraudulent nature of the investigation has furthered the deception perpetrated upon the masses that the wtc was demolished as a result of terrorists plowing two commercial airplanes filled with thousand of gallons of jet fuel directly into the twin towers at a high rate of speed
7313075 are operational in earth s orbit at high altitude low altitude at sea and on land ranging in lethality from the capacity to do great damage such as that of destroying the world trade center twin towers in less than 10 seconds each as occurred on 9 11 01 down to and including imposition of a disabling stun on human beings for crowd control and or other psy ops psychological operations purposes
7313076 plaintiffs understandably offer nothing more than conjecture and supposition to support their claim that the towers were struck by high powered energy beams their personal hypothesis about what should be concluded from publicly disclosed information does not qualify either of them as an original source of information in order to sustain an individual fca claim on behalf of the government
7313077 plaintiffs theories about the cause of the 9 11 disaster completely fail to state a cognizable claim for relief
7313078 fellow citizens 9 11 was a false flag operation by an international war crimes racketeering organisation to provide a pretext to engage in a genocidal and ecocidal depleted uranium bombing of central asia afghanistan and iraq in order to secure vast oil and uranium reserves to roll out a terror based national security state system worldwide and to implement the final stages of a world depopulation policy
7313079 its obvious to me that you have to consider all the possible alternatives
7313080 you cant exclude any lest as you proceed in your investigation and eliminate hypotheses you eliminate the true hypothesis because youve never allowed it to be considered
7313081 now isnt it true that on the 5th of november last year you rode naked through the streets on top of a dustcart letting off fireworks and singing i did it my way loudly
7313082 money can buy almost anything but anything is nothing when youre dead
7313083 you totally disregard the writings of what the church received from the apostles plus you disregard other writings that might help augment what the bible is saying you dont know what was taught and you deny that anybody else can instead you want us to rely on that silly woman dee dee who just writes whatever pops into her imagination that will possibly support a doctrine that has little real basis in fact

7313119 it is expected that the corporation would experience financial losses for about three years and then become a self sustaining enterprise
7313120 those that claim that todays approval of the budget should be postponed are doing so for political reasons rather than professional reasons
7313121 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7313122 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7313123 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7313124 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7313125 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7313126 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7313127 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7313128 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7313129 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should ben affleck be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us
7313130 why shouldnt he be in denver he has nothing to be ashamed of
7313131 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps

7313136 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7313137 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7313138 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7313139 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7313140 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7313141 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7313142 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7313143 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track

7313153 du hast in den ersten runden eine plastikt te aufgesammelt war das die phase in runde acht als du etwas auf heikki kovalainen verloren hast
7313154 ja das war in der mitte der ersten stints runde acht k nnte hinkommen
7313155 auch wenn felipe massa und lewis hamilton schneller waren so konntest du aber von kovalainen und kimi r ikk nen wegziehen
7313156 ja aber ich kam dennoch eine halbe minute nach hamilton ins ziel das ist schon eine gro e l cke der entscheidende moment des wochenendes war das qualifying ich kam auf rang drei und es stellte sich heute heraus dass ich mehr sprit an bord hatte als die beiden autos vor mir daher waren die runden im qualifying besonders gut und das war der schl ssel ansonsten w re ich hinter kimi und kovalainen gestartet und w re ich h chstwahrscheinlich auch hinter ihnen ins ziel gekommen
7313157 glaubst du dass du deine jetzige position im rest der saison behaupten kannst
7313158 ich werde es versuchen im vergangenen rennen startete ich auch aus der zweiten reihe aber ich kam viel weiter hinten ins ziel ich gebe mein bestes ich glaube dass das alle versuchen aber wir m ssen realistisch sein unsere wahre pace d rfte eher dem entsprechen was wir im rennen zeigten nicht wie im qualifying bei l ngeren stints haben wir etwas mehr probleme als ferrari und mclaren mit neuen reifen konnte ich etwas mehr herausholen aber sobald die reifen etwas abgefahren sind beginnt das auto zu sehr zu rutschen dann kann man nichts mehr ausrichten
7313159 die jungs haben nach dem feuer einen unglaublichen job gemacht

7313161 ein platz in reihe eins ist toll hoffentlich holen wir im rennen ein gutes ergebnis
7313162 es ist ziemlich klar ersichtlich dass wir auf den rundestrecken richtig schnelle autos besitzen
7313163 helio und ich pushen uns gegenseitig und das ist ein gro er bonus denn so haben wir gleich zwei richtig schnelle autos wir vergleichen nach jeder session die daten und so kann jeder vom anderen lernen wir arbeiten eng zusammen und das hilft

7313191 so he said it was very good his one complaint was he was surprised that there were no protests that took place china did open up a couple of parks set aside for protest zones with the condition that people had to apply to hold a protest there well 77 people applied to hold protests none were held so basically china is saying those protest applications were either withdrawn or were resolved so jacques rogge was a little surprised to hear that and also a little concerned to hear that

7313207 neither b c nor any individual health authority is alone in its challenge to recruit and retain the number of physicians required to meet the growing demand for medical care over the coming decades
7313208 because most physicians serving communities are private business people and do not work for ih recruitment was the responsibility of site level physicians alone however given recruitment challenges in todays market ih has developed a comprehensive approach to support communities in attracting physicians
7313209 research shows that more than 50 per cent of physicians would use the web to begin searching for new practice opportunities the new website ensures that the health authority is able to maximize web based marketing strategies in its efforts to address current physician supply challenges for communities throughout ih

7313214 we still have to get the chassis figured out and get a good steering and brake system going before we build the frame then we will cover the frame with a mold exterior of a penguin hopefully once its all airbrushed itll look pretty good and will run well

7313219 not at all we respect that the city is trying to get rid of graffiti but its not going to stop someone from being an artist and wanting to be an artist so this is a legal and safe way to do whatever you want on the side of a truck

7313226 i havent heard that is the case today so unfortunately i cannot support a full road closure which otherwise might have support of the neighbourhood just to get it over with
7313227 if it is the wish of council we are quite prepared to have that manned 24 hours a day to prevent other traffic from using that route

7313244 would be how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight other questions raised by controlling the mind how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands as cognitive neuroscience and related technologies become more pervasive using technology for nefarious purposes becomes easier
7313245 the potential impact of neuroscience research is greater than previously thought

7313261 but it turned out to be a wonderfully appropriate venue in that like the opera it is really neither east nor west this is music ive lived with for most of my life and now i have this magnificent cast to produce it i want to say im a pig in but that would be indelicate im in heaven in a sense ive been waiting to do something like this since i was a boy
7313262 and must have taught me how to make a piano work
7313263 what i remember most is how he treated me like an adult no hello little boy stuff and i had this lucky conversational break in that they started to talk about ts eliot we had this tape at home of alec guinness reading eliot which i knew so i quoted some which bacon seemed to quite like
7313264 outlandish juxtapositions of evocative sound objects that hover shimmering or dreamily revolve in a seemingly motionless sonic emulsion i know of no other music quite like it in these defining respects
7313265 but many paintings by dal de chirico magritte mr ad s himself seems to see his music rather than hear it
7313266 there was no model of the nine to five life
7313267 but i could see that my parents worked extremely hard in a slightly less conventional way
7313268 being puzzled and challenged by certain sounds there was a bit of attraction and a bit of repulsion in that these sour notes made me wince but i really wanted to go back to them and find out why they hurt me so much
7313269 depeche mode duran duran who im not going to be snobby about a flock of seagulls the human league those things have a sound you just dont find now there is a sort of harshness and violence although some of it is out of tune
7313270 more into doing these thorny problematic pieces that i would play rather solidly
7313271 and i think it started very quietly and then everyone came in very loudly together
7313272 something like minimalism was still seen as an attack on other types of contemporary composition that sort of division and anger doesnt seem to matter so much any more and it actually feels very last century it was so polarised and thank goodness it is over there are lots of things people can disagree about without having to argue under some sort of standard
7313273 no agenda is more important than what a piece needs to be and looking back the only pieces that really survived from that terrible ideological time are the ones that stepped away from the whole thing
7313274 hearing his music coming out of a record player at the guildhall when i was 15 or 16 although not knowing what it was about i could tell from the very first line that there was blood rushing through it it had an emotional interest that i didnt necessarily hear in a lot of his contemporaries a door into that sound world had been opened
7313275 it was a very big moment for me there was definitely something of a mythological dimension in my head that he was there in the hall
7313276 musicians generally run a mile from it even when you have worked out what to do with the notation it is almost designed as an assault course on a musician but working with a group for so long means they are prepared to go the extra mile and capable of going that extra half inch
7313277 but a rather different kind of genius i knew he had these outstanding gifts so it was a rather nice surprise that he was also a recognisably ordinary person he was very much rooted in real life which i think was something that appealed to me about his music while it has always been brilliant it has also always been meaningful people said that his earlier music was brilliant but superficial in fact i think something like the chamber symphony was very moving and extraordinary and he went on to take on increasingly large themes in a quite visionary way
7313278 he had this sound that was and is his own you can listen to it blind and know it is tom it communicates itself very directly to an audience and is so clever and witty and draws on this vast array of influences from both high and low culture
7313279 the phenomenon of ad ss celebrity has achieved a self perpetuating critical mass in which the detail of this piece or that performance can seem almost incidental
7313280 he manages to distil the affective power of the nimrod variation from elgars enigma into just 17 bars
7313281 uncanny ability to give elegant eloquent musical form to strange and disturbing subjects to be subversive in very public places
7313282 enviable position of never knowing what hell do next but having complete confidence that it will be a masterpiece it has also afforded a view of the performance tradition that has grown up for the work the piano quintet 2000 was commissioned by the arditti quartet who played in their own way
7313283 but then hearing the scharoun ensemble made up of members of the berlin philharmonic giving a performance straight out of the central european tradition showed the work in a completely new light
7313284 i was writing it literally right up to the performance and i think that slow process of putting notes on a page came through in my conducting when i came back and did it in 2007 i wasnt thinking about the writing process and was instead just thinking about making the action happen so i pushed it a little faster which i think worked a little better
7313285 i had a beautiful page and a half length aria but the music pushed me very hard as it was written at the extreme top of my voice it wasnt technically difficult in terms of things like key or time signatures in the way some of his other work is tricky but it was challenging and in the end worked brilliantly in terms of the role caliban is not an easeful character
7313286 its 20 minutes long and normally id have to wait until id written three or four other pieces which would be unrelated apart from being written by me before i had the requisite amount of music to release a cd but i thought it might be better to just put it out straight away and i hope that will be the way i do things in future
7313287 it just didnt occur to anyone there to comment on the fact that there are some pictures to look at while youre listening to music
7313288 london in particular is crawling with new music its like an anthill
7313289 writing and performing and conducting is fine in artistic terms
7313290 i seem to be able to manage all three but physically it is hard i felt i was having to force a piece recently and i got quite ill working on this stravinsky has been absolutely invigorating but i am looking forward to that sense of allowing the empty vessel to replenish itself a little i do need my well of imagination to catch up a bit
7313291 theres always music going through my head and ill certainly be doing some writing
7313292 doing them all has also served me very well where they meet is in making a shape out of the fog most of what i do as a composer is gradually seeing your way to something clear out of something far less clear the final piece might be the clear shape itself or the clear shape might be the process in getting there and its the same with everything else its really all about attempting to make something out of nothing
7313293 i hadnt planned the third movement of asyla as having a house music element but once i started the piece rushed in that direction the devil was on one shoulder and an angel on the other and i remember thinking i might never be taken seriously again but it was never going to be hooked on classics its a knights move away and is related to house music in the way a haydn minuet might be related to music in a viennese square david lynch said all his films have a scene which he calls the eye of a duck a duck is this feathery thing apart from the eye but without the eye the rest of the duck would not have its duckness this is my eye of the duck

7313295 we need to come to the table in september at the senior official level to test the seriousness of going forward to bring forward new ideas to overcome some of the problems that we encountered in july that we were not able to overcome at that time and quite frankly to stop the deterioration and the erosion of what was on the table in july

7313313 we live in a surveillance society it is pointless to talk about surveillance society in the future tense in all the rich countries of the world everyday life is suffused with surveillance encounters not merely from dawn to dusk but 24 7 some encounters obtrude into the routine like when we get a ticket for running a red light when no one was around but the camera but the majority are now just part of the fabric of daily life unremarkable
7313314 in the world of high technology and global commerce unintended consequences of well meaning actions and policies abound
7313315 moreover privacy and data protection laws do not easily regulate a wide range of surveillance practices such as those that are part of modern telecommunications and cannot easily be interpreted expansively to do so in addition the harm that surveillance may do to individuals groups and whole societies do not come within the range of impacts that these individual rights based laws are designed to remedy or prevent
7313316 identity systems must only reveal information identifying a user with the users consent
7313317 function creep whilst the capabilities of individual technologies and systems are important there is also increasing technological synergy or convergence of surveillance technologies
7313318 businesses and citizens are being conscripted into the construction of a surveillance society
7313319 this also means that new products can emerge out of older technologies which in themselves had been understood and managed by regulators coming together to create an entirely unforeseen and unregulated function
7313320 with human discretion removed and embedded in code and when cultural and national identity has become such a contested dimension of life carrying a heavy freight of life chances and choices memories and hopes it is ironic that parallel efforts are made to reduce it to machine readable formulae and algorithms for ease of bureaucratic policing and corporate administration

7313398 luvdarts are much more than just a mobile video download to the consumer they are digital greeting cards they can send to their family friends and lovers but to a business they are valuable tools in harnessing the power of word of mouth peer2peer advertising
7313399 well its a well known fact that the most effective marketing comes from personal recommendations by family and friends and there have never been greater opportunities for a business to market directly to consumers than the mobile space presents today the problem is how to get directly to the consumer without violating their privacy and rules set forth to protect the consumer by the wireless industry luvdarts get people to spread the word family to family friend to friend lover to lover and we let the businesses subsidize the activity
7313400 its simple we let a business run a campaign whenever they want to drive more traffic to their physical location or website s they can choose the start and end dates their target market daily download budget and incentives we then stock their luvdart downloading store with co branded luvdarts they distribute a code to their customers who can visit that store and download luvdarts free under the terms of that campaign
7313401 oh i get it the business pays for the download later at a wholesale price
7313402 thats right the business only pays for whats been downloaded to be clear there is a setup charge for each campaign
7313403 hmmm very interesting concept i see where people will want to send luvdarts to their family and friends as they also carry a businesses message and promotions without violating their privacy how are you going to get this going with businesses
7313404 thats a great question first we think any business that advertises in the yellow pages will be interested in a luvdarts campaign why the average business is paying a monthly amount for an ad they cant change for 12 months in the yellow pages we give them the ability to run a campaign of different sizes and targets whenever they please for local businesses as well as national that is huge the traffic that will come from a campaign is generated mainly from their existing patrons word of mouth and the business is able to control the times when it may need more traffic driven to its location

7313410 our approach has been exceedingly effective for both young men and women we are uniquely positioned to give clients the wake up call of wilderness therapy as well as the counseling services and tools to stay clean and sober permanently
7313411 we are the only wilderness program out there that teaches daily living skills and helps clients acclimate to being in a community setting prior to discharge so the transition onward doesnt come as such a culture shock that gives each individual a chance to see how recovery will look for them not just in the wilderness but back in real life
7313412 by living and working with these young people day and night both in the unfamiliar wilderness setting and familiar base camp environment we can go beyond words and talk therapy and actually see how their substance abuse and co occurring issues impact their daily lives
7313413 in just two years we have established a strong national reputation for clinical excellence
7313414 our therapists travel all over the country to attend conferences develop new skills and improve the quality of their services their hard work has helped us make a name for ourselves in a relatively short period of time
7313415 the substance abuse field is relatively young so there is always room for improvement
7313416 one of our hallmarks is that were never satisfied with the status quo we are always evolving and finding new ways to provide the highest quality clinical services and state of the art treatment when it comes to substance abuse and co occurring mental health issues

7313452 the zurich and london agreements form a landmark in the course of this struggle but at the same time are a starting point for further struggles with the object of capitalising on what has been achieved for further conquests
7313453 greek cypriots must continue to march forward to complete the work began by the eoka heroes
7313454 until this small turkish community that forms part of the turkish race which has been the terrible enemy of hellenism is expelled the duty to the heroes of eoka cannot be considered as terminated

7313463 i cannot rule out that the state duma will appeal to the countrys leadership to recognize the independence of abkhazia

7313465 right after the conflict with georgia russia would look very indecent if it immediately annexed south ossetia and abkhazia
7313466 russia will be perfectly content if they are pseudo independent states
7313467 the wisest thing to do at this point like in kosovo would be to recognize their self styled governments and maybe give them a 10 year stabilization period
7313468 russia will be perfectly content if they are pseudo independent states

7313554 for months ive searched for a leader to finish this journey alongside me and to join in me in making washington work for the american people i searched for a leader who understands the rising costs confronting working people and who will always put their dreams first a leader who sees clearly the challenges facing america in a changing world with our security and standing set back by eight years of a failed foreign policy a leader who shares my vision of an open government that calls all citizens democrats republicans and independents to a common purpose above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden joe biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7313555 ill say straight up to you john mccain and the press knows this is genuinely a friend of mine ive known john for 35 years he served our country with extraordinary courage and i know he wants to do right by america but the harsh truth is ladies and gentlemen you cant change america when you boast and these are johns words quote the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush ladies and gentlemen thats what he said you cant change america when you supported george bushs policies 95 of the time you cant change america when you believe and these are his own words that in the bush administration weve made great progress economically you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote ladies and gentlemen you cant change america you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7313556 ladies and gentlemen this is no ordinary time this is no ordinary election and this may be our last chance to reclaim the america we love to restore americas soul now its time for all of us as lincoln said to put our feet in the right place and to stand firm

7313627 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7313628 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7313629 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7313630 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7313631 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
7313632 tremendous groundbreaking figure everyone admires her greatly he is going to need her in the senate
7313633 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7313634 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old
7313635 the convention will give us an opportunity to reach out to those people hillary is going to be 100 per cent for him
7313636 now three years later our country is still mired in the middle east were talking about more war more cold war and russia and georgia and invading iran and pakistan

7313659 you know all i want for christmas this year is to have a bright sister
7313660 they are planning to target colleges and universities with a new version of the kindle
7313661 ive submitted an objection to this proposed development as i have serious concerns about certain aspects specifically the residential element the large number of parking spaces provided and the overall height of the buildings
7313662 i would have a major worry about the height of some of the proposed buildings while i accept that the castleknock urban centre strategy ucs which was recently adopted by the council suggests an indicative height of 4 stories for buildings in this area i would argue that this is inappropriate in an area which still has a typical village setting i would say that at most buildings should not exceed 3 stories and that the proposed development should be amended to reflect this
7313663 provision for such a large number of cars is obviously going to have a big impact on traffic in the centre of castleknock village i believe that the proposed number of spaces is too great as i point out in my objection the amount of parking contained within the proposed development is significantly more than the amount which the castleknock ucs suggested would be appropriate i would propose that the number of parking spaces be reduced in line with what the castleknock ucs suggests in order to reduce the traffic impact on the village castleknock village will soon be served with a significantly upgraded bus corridor as such the use of public transport should be encouraged as much as possible creating large commercial car parks acts as a disincentive to this
7313664 out of the 49 proposed apartments in the development only one is a 3 bed all the rest are 1 or 2 beds as such it is clear that there is a significant undersupply of large family friendly 3 bed units and an oversupply of 1 bed units in a development that is being promoted as a model of new urban design we think it is highly inappropriate that so many small apartments should be constructed this would also be in keeping with the castleknock ucs which suggests limiting the number of small apartments
7313665 while i would welcome certain aspects of this development such as the idea of an extension of the existing streetscape and the plans for new civic spaces i hope fingal county coiuncil will take on board the reservations myself and residents have on the issue outlined in our objections
7313666 i need to know if you dance just like you would

7313683 it was a horror i thought it was a terror attack
7313684 gurl i thought rosie odonnell was breaking into my apartment
7313685 the worst natural disaster to strike america since hurricane barbara flooded houston
7313686 besides im only a block or so away wheres krystal
7313687 i say we go inside where its cool how about a hug whyre you so snippy today
7313688 i was having a bad day until now i hope youll forgive me
7313689 what did you say to mrs hammerstein that sent her packing
7313690 perhaps you have forgotten that you are in brentwood if you want a discount you might be better served in echo park
7313691 i told the cheap bitch to look elsewhere so in case you havent heard my husband is having an affair have you recently colored your hair you really should consider going blond youre beginning to look like ann miller
7313692 stanleys impotent you know his dick only works once every three or four years the thing is well i never expected he would stray so close to home
7313693 we should call krystal and ask if she knows that is unless her mouth is full of limp sausage right now
7313694 damned illegals what do you mean she knows of course she knows
7313695 god you are an awful woman last weekend she and i were having cocktails at the w in westwood and we saw stanley leaving the hotel with a woman i think she was fresh out of high school or something
7313696 whatever her age she is very pretty pass me your water
7313697 anyway the girl has red hair but all resemblance to krystal stops there
7313698 we went to the area and found out that the bombardment was very heavy lots of houses have been destroyed and more than 90 non combatants including women children and elderly people have died
7313699 they have claimed that taliban were there they must prove it
7313700 so far it is not clear for us why the coalition conducted the air strikes

7313702 the afghan government has frequently emphasised not harming civilians but unfortunately it has not been listened to very well
7313703 the concern is that the government and international community will lose the credibility of the afghan people
7313704 the paradox is that the pursuit of passion involves excitement mystery unpredictability but the pursuit of intimacy involves wanting to be known completely and expecting predictability and yet we want both
7313705 a modicum of freedom in a relationship dont ask the other person to give up freedom so you can feel more secure
7313706 i was afraid to see the stars so cold so far and so very lonely oh so lonely all that space just empty space so far from home ive circled round and round this house orbit after orbit sometimes id wonder what it would be like never to stop and circle alone up there forever and what if i got there got to the moon and couldnt get back sure everyone dies but im afraid to die alone so far from home and if theres no god then thats really really alone
7313707 how about chew hot shot where are you and whats the report
7313708 why hell were out here in this hell hole trying to git on my fish
7313709 sloppy out to the spuds but settling down out here where we were on garbled day before yesterday at ah garbled 2 foot
7313710 we just lost an antenna the mount snapped is it better out there
7313711 hell dont let a few bumps bother you hit the fasten seat belt sign and bring it on
7313712 we just lost the depth o meter i think the transducer got knocked off standby the troll just went over the mount broke but the cord got caught on the power steering actuator so we saved it to hell with this were rtp pronto
7313713 people probably didnt think i would get far because of where im from
7313714 being able to do what ive always wanted to do my entire life is a gift and my whole dream has come true to see where i am from where i was is just crazy
7313715 if we can spend 10 to 12 billion a month in iraq we sure as hell can pay 10 to 12 million billion dollars right here in the united states
7313716 i apologize by the way i usually say heck especially after church that sort of slipped out
7313717 the nonprofit nonpartisan advocacy partner of the american cancer society
7313718 milf units that targeted villages have engaged in serious violations of international law and should be held to account
7313719 but experience from around the world shows that the deployment of civilian militias can set off a chain of reprisals and only increases the danger facing civilians
7313720 all sides to this conflict should step back from the brink and demonstrate their commitment to avoid harming civilians the milf must control its forces and the philippine government should take responsibility for the security of all peoples in the philippines regardless of religion or ethnicity
7313721 we have to protect ourselves the military could not warrant our safety they come late
7313722 the recent violent attacks by milf elements have of course shaken many of mindanaos residents who have every right to demand greater protection
7313723 many people in mindanao are terrified of a return to a period when armed muslim insurgents and christian vigilante ilaga groups attacked civilians with impunity

7313736 the recent growth of large single specialty groups that dominate a market might also contribute to decreased charity care in seattle for example access to orthopedic surgeons is virtually nonexistent for uninsured people and medicaid enrollees because a single group of orthopedic surgeons has a virtual monopoly in the community and does not accept medicaid or uninsured patients

7313740 residents are not satisfied with the pace of the recovery effort but they do see it moving in the right direction
7313741 this was one of the worst races ever for me
7313742 to finish ninth in a car which is obviously good enough for third is a disaster
7313743 after qualifying i was pretty confident because we realised we could go well
7313744 but in the race i had big problems with the harder tyres during the first two stints and it was only better at the end with the softer compound
7313745 i lost one position after the start and later in the race i couldnt gain any
7313746 certainly we enjoyed being back on the podium with it being the fifth time this year for robert
7313747 starting from eighth was not an ideal situation for nick
7313748 we were hoping he would improve one or two places at the start but in the heat of the moment he unfortunately lost a position and then the race was basically over for him
7313749 nick started from eighth hence we expected him to score championship points
7313750 we saw another extremely solid vodafone mclaren mercedes team performance today the result of which was a very useful clutch of championship points but in truth we lost the chance of outright victory yesterday in qualifying
7313751 in my view its pretty clear that if lewis had qualified with the same level of fuel as felipe hed probably have been able to control the race from the front
7313752 the nature of the circuit dictated that it was always going to be difficult for lewis to overtake today and that being the case we opted fairly early on to take the championship strategic option of settling for second place
7313753 my start was good and i was consequently able to overtake kimi raikkonen before the first corner
7313754 however im not really happy with how the race went for me after that because i had grip problems with the prime tyres in the first and second stints whereas with the option tyres in the last stint i had much better grip and traction
7313755 as a result i could close the gap to robert kubica a little
7313756 at least i scored five points but a podium would have been much nicer
7313757 i had a good start to the race and gained three places to 13th but that was the highlight of my race really
7313758 we made things difficult for ourselves by qualifying so far back on the grid after we had expected to perform a lot better
7313759 i was heavily fuelled compared to most others and running long on a one stop strategy but i was stuck behind heidfeld when he had already pitted which cost me some time as i didnt have the pace to overtake him
7313760 we ran the option tyre for the second stint which was initially fine but then the rears went away quite badly due to the rear brakes overheating
7313761 after qualifying we took the opportunity to start from the pit lane and work on the car to try and resolve the issues that we had yesterday
7313762 we changed the brakes completely so the car was very different to drive but it did improve a little bit during the race
7313763 we need to get to the bottom of the brake problems that we have had all weekend as these cost me a lot of time and positions it was a poor weekend overall
7313764 fundamentally we have improved the car over the august break and we saw clear signs of that progress in free practice
7313765 we didnt make the most of that when it counted this weekend and we suffered in qualifying and the race as a result
7313766 so our first priority will be to understand where we failed and make sure we have a more robust approach for spa and beyond
7313767 after such a bad result we came here to a track that was new for everybody and we just did a fantastic job preparing the car in the practice sessions choosing the right tyres which i think was pretty difficult and then making pole position winning the race and making the fastest lap
7313768 theres nothing more you can ask for especially after such a bad result in hungary
7313769 im so glad and happy especially after such a disaster in hungary
7313770 the start was just great and i was very keen to start on the clean side
7313771 we made it i braked a little bit too early for the first corner watching how they were fighting behind but i managed to stay in front
7313772 the first stint was very good and i was pulling away from lewis by a couple of tenths every lap
7313773 i think we won the race in the second stint because the car was just perfect then and the lap times were improving lap by lap it was amazing to see the gap increasing at that rate
7313774 in the last stint with the increased grip on the track the temperature or whatever the car was even better on the soft tyres
7313775 so i was able to drive in a really relaxed way which sometimes is a big problem but i was doing similar lap times as the second stint
7313776 so it was amazing how the car behaved in the last stint as well
7313777 we still need to work very hard on that because today we had another problem with kimi and another one in the pits
7313778 we have so many important races in front of us
7313779 picked somebody who has unparalleled expertise on foreign policy somebody who will help him rebuild the economy put people back to work make our country independent of energy
7313780 were comfortable with our pick we had a lot of great choices and we talked to a lot of different people but i think we settled on a great pick and a great partnership to bring about change in this country
7313781 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7313782 she had 50 percent of the democratic vote obama has 50 percent of the democratic vote
7313783 you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7313784 senator joe bidens personal story has been tested many many times

7313786 theyre equally good tickets hillary clinton obviously has a longer relationship with a broader spectrum of voters women voters
7313787 but joe bidens going to grow on the american people very fast
7313788 they had a discussion back in early june about it and he spent more time with senator clinton alone talking about issues than he has with joe biden or anyone else
7313789 knew her he knew her very well and so there wasnt the same need as there was for other candidates
7313790 theres no question that people had strong feelings about their nominee we went from beginning to end
7313791 i think thats going to be the role of the convention to really be a unifying time
7313792 hes got to talk about economic issues and hes got to be more clear
7313793 we need certainly senator obama to let the americans know what his plan is for as president of the united states how hes going to help rebuild restore the middle class
7313794 i dont accept that thats what barack obama hasnt been doing and i think that he will give a clear picture again this week of where we have to go
7313795 joe biden works in washington but he doesnt live there
7313796 he is somebody who never has forgotten where hes from hes a down to earth kind of guy

7313819 herr haug heute nur platz zwei f r lewis keine chance gegen felipe massa aber wm punkte gesammelt wie haben sie das rennen gesehen
7313820 absolut stark das rennen ist sehr vorentschieden wenn man erster oder zweiter im qualifying ist wenn man nicht auf der richtigen seite steht das haben wir schon oft gesehen das soll gar keine entschuldigung sein aber ich glaube mit einem gewonnenen start ist da schon viel erreicht siehe ungarn siehe hier
7313821 massa war gut aber sicher nicht rundherum unschlagbar das m chte ich gar nicht sagen denn wenn man vorne f hrt sieht das spiel anders aus wenn man druck machen kann er hat verdient gewonnen aber ferrari ist sicherlich unter druck ihnen ist zweimal hintereinander im zweiten rennen der motor kaputt gegangen das zweite rennen wird f r massa spa sein ich will berhaupt nicht unken aber das geh rt in die saisonplanung mit dazu mir tut es leid f r die kollegen aber man muss technisch perfekt sein wir bekommen neue motoren f r spa und spa ist die motorenstrecke schlechthin auch uns kann was passieren um gottes willen nur da ist sicherlich druck in der partie
7313822 wir hatten die gr ten ersatzteilkisten dabei und haben 0 0 gebraucht das ist wirklich sehr erfreulich
7313823 wir haben dreimal 14 punkte gemacht und jetzt 13 damit haben wir den abstand in der konstrukteurs wm auf acht punkte verk rzt das waren schon mal 24 der wagen f hrt in die richtige richtung sage ich mal ich finde es toll dass so viele fahrer berhaupt keinen fehler gemacht haben wir hatten die gr ten ersatzteilkisten dabei und haben 0 0 gebraucht das ist wirklich sehr erfreulich jeder hat mit dem safety car gerechnet es war eine grandiose premiere es ging nichts kaputt und es war wunderbar und sch n 18 punkte sind das maximum die hat man lieber aber wenn man dreimal 14 und einmal 13 hat dann ist man in diesem kompetitiven feld sicherlich gut unterwegs in diesen vier rennen waren wir am besten von allen
7313824 es ist besser wenn man die facts nennt das ist wie bei einem bankkonto wenn man regelm ig auch nur kleine betr ge einzahlt dann wird die summe gr er am schluss wird zusammengez hlt ich wei wie es ist wenn ein punkt fehlt denn das haben wir im letzten jahr gleich bei zwei fahrern erlebt
7313825 lewis hamilton hat jetzt sechs punkte vorsprung und scheint sehr gut in form zu sein haben sie das gef hl dass schon eine vorentscheidung gefallen sein k nnte
7313826 berhaupt nicht kimi r ikk nen ist da auch noch mittendrin und es ist auch zu kubica nicht weit ich glaube sowieso dass kubica echte zeiten setzt in der formel 1 er hat seinen marktwert enorm gesteigert nick heidfeld anm d red ist kein fahrer der es langsam angehen l sst aber vom speed her war robert kubica heute in einer anderen liga ich kenne die gr nde daf r nicht
7313827 wir haben insgesamt einen tollen grand prix gehabt viele werden sagen dass es nicht spannend genug war aber wir haben vettel auf dem sechsten und glock auf dem siebten platz mit einer guten strategie rosberg auf dem achten wir sind mit zwei autos auch deutsch dabei bmw mit einem auto der toyota wird auch in k ln gebaut die deutschen fans d rfen sich da nicht beklagen da gibt es immer tolle themen
7313828 ich als sportfan muss sagen dass ich mich f r toro rosso und f r sebastian vettel anm d red freue man kennt ihn seit er in der formel bmw gefahren ist er hat einen aufstieg gemacht und f hrt hier voll mit den gro en buben mit hat rundenlang mit kimi r ikk nen mitgehalten da muss man gerhard berger franz tost giorgio ascanelli und all den leuten die dahinter stehen ein kompliment machen
7313829 so ein team sollte auch mal ordentlich sponsorgeld bekommen denn die sind aus dem nichts vom 18 20 platz in einem halben jahr aufgestiegen sie haben adrian newey als konstrukteur den ich aus unserer zusammenarbeit gut kenne das ist toll so etwas zu sehen wenn sie mal vor uns fahren ist meine begeisterung wahrscheinlich ein bisschen kleiner aber bisher ist es wirklich toll
7313830 f r lewis hat es bei der siegerehrung von den spaniern ein paar pfiffe gegeben
7313831 die blamieren sich doch selbst das ist sport er hat alonso in den meisten f llen geschlagen wenn man das nicht akzeptieren kann dann kann ich dar ber nicht mal grinsen die sollen pfeifen aber das ist peinlich
7313832 ja er hatte r ckenbeschwerden gestern war es ganz bel da h tte er fast nicht fahren k nnen in der fr h haben wir schon dar ber nachgedacht aber wir haben nat rlich keine ger usche deswegen gemacht nach dem rennen kann man es ja sagen er hatte einen nerv eingeklemmt und hatte ganz ble schmerzen aber die physiotherapeuten haben einen superjob gemacht es ging heute schon das soll auch keine ausrede sein aber das war gestern vor dem qualifying nat rlich nicht ideal als rennvorbereitung wenn man nicht erster werden kann dann muss man versuchen die acht punkte zu machen so kann man weltmeister werden
7313833 ja aber da hat er seine gro e klasse gezeigt der dritte hat nat rlich einen vorteil auf der griplinie gegen den zweiten kubica war schon daneben aber lewis hat seinen punkt verteidigt und dann war die sache gegessen kubica hat in der ecke dann viel verloren weil er nicht das ganze momentum mitnehmen konnte
7313834 dann war der boxenstopp von felipe massa wo er fast mit adrian sutil kollidiert w re wie haben sie das gesehen erwarten sie eine strafe
7313835 wir m chten so nicht rennen gewinnen das ist ganz klar mit der pole und dem gewonnenen start h tten wir das rennen gewinnen k nnen aber so nicht ich denke das ergebnis wird schon so bleiben wir sind mal vorsorglich deutlich weniger als zehn sekunden drangeblieben ich glaube n mlich nicht dass es eine f nf sekunden strafe gibt
7313836 vor dem letzten rennen waren wir f nf und acht punkte vor unseren verfolgern jetzt sind es sechs und 13 es ist gut gelaufen wir haben uns glaube ich sehr gut verkauft hier es war eine grandiose premiere in valencia

7313844 as pessoas se mostraram muito mais interessadas nos personagens negativos que nos moralmente corretos isso para mim foi uma completa surpresa
7313845 porque todas estas coisas mundanas estes maus desejos a loucura pelo sexo ambi o de comprar tudo que atrai voc s e o orgulho que resulta da riqueza e do prest gio n o prov m de deus e sim do pr prio mundo pecaminoso e este mundo est perecendo e estas coisas m s e proibidas perecer o com ele mas todo aquele que faz a vontade de deus viver para sempre
7313846 n o se enganem ningu m zomba de deus o que uma pessoa plantar isso mesmo que colher se plantar no terreno da sua natureza humana desse terreno colher a morte por m se plantar no terreno do esp rito de deus desse terreno colher a vida eterna n o nos cansemos de fazer o bem pois se n o desanimarmos chegar o tempo certo em que faremos a colheita

7313856 venham a mim todos voc s que est o cansados de carregar as suas pesadas cargas e eu lhes darei descanso
7313857 h caminhos que parecem certos mas podem acabar levando para a morte
7313858 jesus respondeu eu sou o caminho a verdade e a vida ningu m pode chegar at o pai a n o ser por mim
7313859 ent o jesus disse para os que creram nele se voc s continuarem a obedecer aos meus ensinamentos ser o de fato meus disc pulos e conhecer o a verdade e a verdade os libertar
7313860 eu sempre fui muito ligado m sica ao rock e sempre tive dolos como jimi hendrix janis joplin e jim morrison que morreram de overdose eu queria viver e morrer jovem como eles e tinha na cabe a aquele mito de n o chegar aos 30 anos como o mick jagger falou um dia
7313861 estou t o perdida ser que algum dia vou me encontrar
7313862 disse jesus venham a mim todos voc s que est o cansados de carregar as suas pesadas cargas e eu lhes darei descanso
7313863 mas voc s s o a ra a escolhida os sacerdotes do rei a na o completamente dedicada a deus o povo que pertence a ele voc s foram escolhidos para anunciar os atos poderosos de deus que os chamou da escurid o para a sua maravilhosa luz
7313864 porquanto para mim o viver cristo e o morrer lucro
7313865 se voc s ficarem unidos comigo e as minhas palavras continuarem em voc s voc s receber o tudo o que pedirem
7313866 coisas que o olho n o viu e o ouvido n o ouviu e n o subiram ao cora o do homem

7313868 eu n o o recebi de ningu m e ningu m o ensinou a mim mas foi o pr prio jesus cristo que o revelou para mim
7313869 essas prova es s o para mostrar que a f que voc s t m verdadeira pois at o ouro que pode ser destru do provado pelo fogo da mesma maneira a f que voc s t m que vale muito mais do que o ouro precisa ser provada para que continue firme e assim voc s receber o aprova o gl ria e honra no dia em que jesus cristo for revelado portanto estejam prontos para agir continuem alertas e ponham toda a sua esperan a na b n o que ser dada a voc s quando jesus cristo for revelado

7313872 o senhor deus diz mas agora voltem para mim com todo o cora o jejuando chorando e se lamentando em sinal de arrependimento n o rasguem as roupas mas sim o cora o
7313873 portanto arrependam se e voltem para deus a fim de que ele perdoe os pecados de voc s
7313874 jesus respondeu eu afirmo ao senhor que isto verdade ningu m pode ver o reino de deus se n o nascer de novo
7313875 de maneira que cada vez que voc s comem deste p o e bebem deste c lice est o anunciando a morte do senhor at que ele venha por isso aquele que comer do p o do senhor ou beber do seu c lice de modo que ofenda a honra do senhor estar pecando contra o corpo e o sangue do senhor portanto que cada um examine a sua consci ncia e ent o coma do p o e beba do c lice pois a pessoa que comer do p o ou beber do c lice sem reconhecer que se trata do corpo do senhor estar sendo julgada ao comer e beber para o seu pr prio castigo por isso que muitos de voc s est o doentes e fracos e alguns j morreram se examin ssemos primeiro a nossa consci ncia n s n o ser amos julgados pelo senhor mas somos julgados e castigados pelo senhor para n o sermos condenados junto com o mundo
7313876 em paz tamb m me deitarei e dormirei porque s tu senhor me fazes habitar em seguran a
7313877 deus eu te pe o apenas duas coisas para minha vida nesta terra n o me deixes ser um mentiroso este o primeiro pedido al m disso n o me deixes ficar nem muito rico e nem muito pobre d me somente aquilo de que realmente preciso

7313879 eu afirmo a voc s que isto verdade quem n o receber o reino de deus como uma crian a nunca entrar nele
7313880 agora que fomos aceitos por deus pela nossa f nele temos paz com ele por meio do nosso senhor jesus cristo agora j n o existe nenhuma condena o para as pessoas que est o unidas com cristo jesus
7313881 que as pessoas perversas mudem a sua maneira de viver e abandonem os seus maus pensamentos voltem para o senhor nosso deus pois ele tem compaix o e perdoa completamente

7313904 eis aqui o que t o somente achei que deus fez ao homem reto por m eles buscaram muitas ast cias
7313905 tudo o que aprendi se resume nisto deus nos fez simples e direitos mas n s complicamos tudo
7313906 de que se queixa pois o homem vivente queixe se cada um dos seus pecados
7313907 porque deus amou o mundo tanto que deu o seu nico filho para que todo aquele que nele crer n o morra mas tenha a vida eterna

7314004 this is a program that recognizes the efforts restaurants put into their wine lists

7314029 most people recognize that poverty is a problem but when they learn about what a real person actually experiences it runs deeper
7314030 weve always had a fondness for reading as a band we have played there three times and every time it has been better than the time before
7314031 im really excited and i really hope it will go off its one of my favourite festivals to visit and play
7314032 ive been there countless times as a fan i dont imagine many people will know much of the new stuff so were not going to overload our set
7314033 we did it in brooklyn we put the audience in there and we got the two times world champions to come on stage and it worked really well got the rhythm going
7314034 it was great fun so weve brought them up today
7314035 most of the international media listening to bolts interview didnt know who hayden was
7314036 at present we do not have any confirmed contracts for chick fil a stores in new york city new york city is a growth market for chick fil a and it is our hope that in the near future we are able to build a chick fil a store in new york
7314037 la idea es poder anunciar el cierre de las negociaciones de este acuerdo bilateral durante la cumbre del apec y con la presencia del presidente de m xico felipe calder n
7314038 nos reunimos con el nuevo ministro de econom a de m xico quien lleva las negociaciones comerciales y ya nos anunci su pronta visita para continuar con las negociaciones
7314039 en este momento nos interesa que el equipo negociador mexicano nos d se ales claras pero nos han dicho que har n todos los esfuerzos posibles para enviarnos en setiembre una nueva propuesta que nos permitir seguir negociando
7314040 la derogaci n de la ley de la selva significa un retroceso reaccionario
7314041 se ha establecido una relaci n de compromiso con varios pa ses lo que ha permitido combatir el desabastecimiento el saboteo etc
7314042 no estamos dejando a los venezolanos sin comer sin vivienda no estamos dejando de invertir aqu para invertir en otros pa ses nosotros tenemos el nivel de inversi n en 53 por ciento y los recursos en relaci n al petr leo van dirigidos a resolver cosas de infraestructura
7314043 las reservas de eeuu est n disminuyendo supongo que tendr n para 9 10 a os a diferencia de venezuela que es donde hay m s reservas de todos los pa ses que est n en la opep
7314044 yo no creo que podamos disminuir la capacidad de producci n estamos en el tercer lugar de suplidor de crudo de eeuu pdvsa es la empresa m s importante del mundo ahorita la industria petrolera se mide en cuanto a las reservas no por las ganancias y si se acaba el petr leo podemos alimentarnos durante 49 a os
7314045 el empleado petrolero siente que su trabajo est siendo tomado en cuenta porque se est invirtiendo ese recurso en el pa s siente que est m s asistido que antes
7314046 yo fui trabajador petrolero y conozco bien esa industria mucha gente critic pdval pero lo que no saben algunas personas es que los trabajadores tienen experiencia en comercializaci n de productos la capacidad de pdvsa es un elemento auxiliar en el rea agr cola y en diversos rubros
7314047 the second commandment of the teaching you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not seduce boys you shall not commit fornication you shall not steal you shall not practice magic you shall not use potions you shall not procure an abortion nor destroy a newborn child
7314048 in our case a murder being once for all forbidden we may not destroy even the fetus in the womb while as yet the human being derives blood from the other parts of the body for its sustenance to hinder a birth is merely a speedier man killing nor does it matter whether you take away a life that is born or destroy one that is coming to birth that is a man which is going to be one you have the fruit already in its seed
7314049 among surgeons tools there is a certain instrument which is formed with a nicely adjusted flexible frame for opening the uterus first of all and keeping it open it is further furnished with an annular blade by means of which the limbs of the child within the womb are dissected with anxious but unfaltering care its last appendage being a blunted or covered hook wherewith the entire fetus is extracted by a violent delivery
7314050 there is also another instrument in the shape of a copper needle or spike by which the actual death is managed in this furtive robbery of life they give it from its infanticide function the name of embruosphaktes meaning
7314051 the doctors who performed abortions all knew well enough that a living being had been conceived and they pitied this most luckless infant state which had first to be put to death to escape being tortured alive
7314052 women who were reputed to be believers began to take drugs to render themselves sterile and to bind themselves tightly so as to expel what was being conceived since they would not on account of relatives and excess wealth want to have a child by a slave or by any insignificant person see then into what great impiety that lawless one has proceeded by teaching adultery and murder at the same time
7314053 and we want abortions to be safe rare and reduce the number of abortions
7314054 es ist immer rgerlich wenn man das 2 0 macht und dann zu schnell den anschlusstreffer kassiert das 1 2 hat den wolfsburgern wieder mumm gegeben
7314055 ich ordne das ergebnis als punktverlust ein wir haben nach der pause zu viele klare chancen vergeben als dass ich zufrieden sein k nnte
7314056 wir haben nach dem 1 2 die k pfe h ngen gelassen das darf nicht passieren
7314057 wir sind auf einem ganz guten weg die mannschaft hat ber weite strecken berzeugt
7314058 wir sind nicht zu hochkar tigen chancen gekommen daran m ssen wir arbeiten
7314059 wir haben nicht richtig gut gespielt aber einen wichtigen punkt geholt
7314060 this detachment signifies another step forward in re establishing humint in the air force
7314061 this is the first humint unit in the air force since 1995 and our efforts are reintegrating humint into the air force isr arsenal to meet the warfighting requirements
7314062 this isnt fair we did nothing wrong and even if we did its never been considered a crime before
7314063 wir m ssen uns die zuverl ssigkeit genau ansehen ich bin zuversichtlich dass das team wei welche gegenma nahmen man treffen kann um auf dieses problem zu reagieren so wie es das fr her schon immer gemacht hat
7314064 ich glaube aber nicht dass ich trotz dieses schlechten ergebnisses aus dem titelrennen bin es sind noch sechs rennen zu fahren und 60 punkte zu holen wir haben gesehen wie schnell sich die situation ndern kann auch wenn mir klar ist dass die dinge nun schwieriger sind
7314065 es war mein fehler und leider bin ich ber denjenigen gefahren der getankt hat wir m ssen schauen was da wirklich passiert ist
7314066 zum gl ck ist piero timpini nicht zu viel passiert ich w nsche ihm das beste und hoffe es geht ihm bald besser
7314067 es war nur in der letzten kurve leider wei ich nicht was da passiert ist aber wir m ssen untersuchen was mit dem motor nicht gestimmt hat vielleicht ist es hnlich dem was felipe im vorigen rennen passiert ist
7314068 wir wissen was die probleme waren aber leider konnten wir sie noch nicht l sen hoffentlich k nnen wir das jetzt im n chsten test abarbeiten und eine l sung finden wenn wir das qualifying richtig hinbekommen wird das viel helfen
7314069 das ist ein schweres aber auch ein unglaublich attraktives los

7314077 we zagen een grote behoefte bij consumenten om op een persoonlijke manier attent te zijn naar elkaar
7314078 veel mensen willen wel wenskaarten versturen maar hebben geen tijd of vergeten het
7314079 via ons kun je je eigen kaart uitzoeken of zelf maken en de volgende dag wordt hij gewoon met de post bezorgd
7314080 de consument wordt ook een beetje producent die behoefte aan zelfexpressie zie je steeds meer alles wordt gepimpt ook de doorbraak van digitale fotografie en het steeds snellere internet maakt greetz mogelijk
7314081 een kaartje is veel meer dan alleen de boodschap die er op staat
7314082 bijna alle ontvangers hangen hem thuis op of zetten hem op de schouw het is een behoefte aan emotie die alleen met een fysieke kaart overkomt
7314083 we hebben al 53 000 vaste klanten en gaan snel de miljoenste kaart verkopen
7314084 in de vs worden jaarlijks 10 miljard kaarten vestuurd ons doel is om binnen enkele jaren 1 procent van die markt te hebben

7314089 de internationale mevrouw dat is toch eigenlijk wel een oud en oud bollig lied bent u dat niet met me eens mevrouw
7314090 nou vind u ook niet dat nu we de jaren 60 n 70 n 80 gehad hebben dat we best een ander strijdlied zouden kunnen nemen
7314091 bent u bereid het besluit te heroverwegen en te bekijken om tot mogelijk een andere conclusie te komen
7314092 wetten en regels wat zijn de wetten wat zijn de regels
7314093 het wordt hier in eindhovenhoven inmiddels wat grimmiger de muziek is gestopt en de me staat klaar om in te grijpen daar verderop wordt gevochten
7314094 n s vemos esse acordo como hist rico ao menos para o youtube
7314095 our job is to make sure our customers know all the benefits of our product service
7314096 first i want to make it clear that i dont wish death upon any of the people crossing the desert in search of a better life i admire that kind of determination we all want that for our families and death should never be a result of our efforts to do so
7314097 however breaking the law should never be a part of that mission either
7314098 with that in mind i pray tell what is the answer here
7314099 on another note as much as i disagreed with your 6 17 post
7314100 im waiting for the planes to tumble waiting for the towns to fall im waiting for the cities to crumble waiting til the sea a crawl and i dont want to know bout evil i only want to know about love i dont want to know bout evil i only want to know bout love yes its getting hard to listen hard for us to use our eyes cause all around that gold is glistenin makin sure it keeps us hypnotized
7314101 wir spielen am besten wenn der gegner nicht da ist
7314102 ich mache immer das was mir gesagt wird das habe ich im osten gelernt
7314103 ich lerne nicht extra franz sisch f r spieler wo diese sprache nicht m chtig sind
7314104 wir lassen uns nicht nerv s machen und das geben wir auch nicht zu
7314105 es war ein wundersch ner augenblick als der bundestrainer sagte komm stefan zieh deine sachen aus jetzt geht s los
7314106 ich hab gleich gemerkt das ist ein druckschmerz wenn man drauf dr ckt
7314107 wir lassen uns beide von unseren frauen scheiden und ziehen zusammen
7314108 zu 50 prozent stehen wir im viertelfinale aber die halbe miete ist das noch lange nicht
7314109 mein problem ist dass ich immer sehr selbstkritisch bin auch mir selbst gegen ber
7314110 da kam dann das elfmeterschie en wir hatten alle die hosen voll aber bei mir lief s ganz fl ssig
7314111 es ist mir v llig egal was es wird hauptsache er ist gesund
7314112 die kroaten sollen ja auf alles treten was sich bewegt da hat unser mittelfeld ja nichts zu bef rchten

7314115 hes essentially put a middle aged white guy on the ticket and i think it compromises the change message
7314116 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11 theres nothing else
7314117 8 pac eagle enewsletter simply follow the link to the subscription form and youre done
7314118 i think to some degree ive become a shorthand or a symbol or a stand in for now
7314119 its a spirit that says we are looking for different
7314120 i aint pro human because all humans aint pro black
7314121 the wonderful progressive impulses of cultural studies its politicization of culture sensitivity to historical context its teasing out of differential receptions
7314122 cultural studies scholars frequently dont think of film aesthetics as being especially important
7314123 the new apichatpong film the new madonna album the super bowl game and the new ipod commercial are all equal and equivalent cultural phenomena to be studied and mined and written about
7314124 well im doing pure math you see whereas youre merely applying
7314125 the film is steeped in christianity because a cross appears x times in y shots the characters a b and c utter the word
7314126 i am sure i can still improve my qualifying and my results
7314127 there is still a long way to go so lets wait and see what happens
7314128 i think i can do better than that so i am trying to improve
7314129 there is not much to say i left the pits a bit too early it was my fault and unfortunately i ran over the guy who was refuelling we need to look and see what really happened
7314130 sure it was not a good day but these things happen in racing i am not too worried i still think i can come back this season
7314131 it was not a great weekend but it is not the first time we are in a bit of a worse situation in the championship but if we get all the things sorted then i think we still have a chance to come back
7314132 we know what the issues have been but unfortunately we havent been able to sort them out hopefully now in the next test we can work a bit and try to find the solution for it if we get the qualifying right it will help a lot
7314133 we still have faith in him of course he is a world champion and we are a loyal team
7314134 father i recognize you as father king of the kingdom that i have entered by being born again
7314135 your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven
7314136 surely the lord is in this place and i was not aware of it
7314137 i was not aware of it god is here heaven is open help has come
7314138 lofty and high superior in rank and position and distinguished by renown and prominence
7314139 we practice what we believe the rest is just religious talk
7314140 raise your taxes during hard economic times kill babies and make sure the county is open to terrorists
7314141 a woman was flying from seattle to san francisco unexpectedly the plane was diverted to sacramento along the way the flight attendant explained that there would be a delay and if the passengers wanted to get off the aircraft the plane would re board in 50 minutes
7314142 kathy we are in sacramento for almost an hour would you like to get off and stretch your legs
7314143 no thanks but maybe buddy would like to stretch his legs

7314150 hey at least i had nothing to do with jaws iii
7314151 like a mustard seed like a man who sowed good seed like leaven like treasure hidden in a field like a merchant looking for fine pearls like a net let down in a lake
7314152 seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness matthew 6 33
7314153 but we have the mind of christ 1 corinthians 2 16
7314154 let this mind be in which was also in christ jesus philippians 2 5
7314155 das ist ein schweres aber auch ein unglaublich attraktives los
7314156 nach jahren h tten wir uns wieder ein heimspiel gew nscht das ist ein schwieriges los aber machbar
7314157 es ist immer rgerlich wenn man das 2 0 macht und dann zu schnell den anschlusstreffer kassiert das 1 2 hat den wolfsburgern wieder mumm gegeben

7314160 crafted from several carefully selected clones this wine is italian in its crisp refreshing style and evokes alsace in its round mouth feel lychee grapefruit lemon zest pear and peach aromas echo on the palate evoking the essence of fresh perfectly ripe pinot grigio grapes remarkably versatile this wine is sensational as an aperitif as an accompaniment to cheese white wine friendly and mediterranean cuisines
7314161 because as soon as the boy started to fall he wasnt worth much
7314162 ultimately before i hire someone i try to figure out just one thing could i drink a beer with this person after work

7314168 at present we do not have any confirmed contracts for chick fil a stores in new york city new york city is a growth market for chick fil a and it is our hope that in the near future we are able to build a chick fil a store in new york
7314169 it now appears that an effort may be underway to depose russias duly elected government russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
7314170 but i just want to emphasize again russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used that will make it that when it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power thats not the way to deal in the 21st century
7314171 well hugh my own view is as the caucuses are a hot spot and as russians have shown their willingness to act militarily against a sovereign nation that the international olympic committee ought to revisit locating the games elsewhere
7314172 where hes wrong is that we went into iraq at the invitation of the government not as an invasion
7314173 were in iraq as the result of a democracy asking for us to come in there its not an invasion
7314174 at the moment rescue teams fire brigades and medics are rushing to the crash site
7314175 it took off and reported a technical problem and tried to return to the airport
7314176 jonathan rhys meyers was the name i wanted the world to know me by and not my birth name
7314177 i wanted to create almost this different person which i suppose doesnt really exist
7314178 people think its all premieres and parties and glamour and i suppose jonathan rhys meyers has some of that
7314179 but johnny actually sits at home plays his guitar badly and hangs out with his friends
7314180 its good that theres a line for me to draw
7314181 i play music i just never wanted to do it as a job
7314182 but if i had pushed it i am sure i could have learned to be a bit better to promote it
7314183 but he felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7314184 senator obama had a great conversation with senator clinton this week as well as former president bill clinton everybodys on board and its going to drive the media crazy when we come out of this convention united
7314185 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7314186 we cannot as a nation stand four more years of this
7314187 yes i have i stepped back and let you on first din i
7314188 yeah yeah you ave a good day too me china
7314189 a boot like merchant navy anyway they employ filipinos these days
7314190 aha that sounds like not a bad idea really either that or become a benedictine monk
7314191 what a remarkable accomplishment for a young man who may be this nations best all around freestyle swimmer
7314192 i feel like i had a great olympic experience but i definitely feel that i wasnt entirely comfortable in that environment
7314193 i think i had the same kind of fears that anyone coming out has particularly since it was 24 years ago but i think the environment actually made it worse
7314194 when youre in an athletic environment when you live in that environment year round theres just not a comfort level of coming out and sharing that kind of information with people
7314195 it wasnt like they were homophobic but they just werent sensitized to it
7314196 i wouldnt say there was any kind of sensitivity to the fact that one of their athletes might be gay
7314197 i think i wouldve continued had i felt comfortable being myself but i didnt and i really kind of felt like i had to give up swimming to come out
7314198 i dont know if it was a conscious choice even but now when i look back and wonder why i didnt go forward that was definitely one of the reasons in the back of my mind
7314199 its gotten better over the years but america is still homophobic and so quick to judge people
7314200 i knew a couple of athletes who were also gay but everybody shows up remains anonymous and nobody wants to bring all of the attention on them
7314201 people dont want to lose big sponsorships because of their sexual orientation
7314202 i met athletes from other countries who you know you just discover after being around a person and spending that much time with them
7314203 definitely you want someone to share those moments with whether youre gay or straight
7314204 just being able to share those moments of fame with someone that you love and care for i missed that part of it
7314205 i dont think three out of however many thousands of athletes there at the olympics is a very high number
7314206 its very difficult for an athlete who is still competing to come out
7314207 one of the great things athletes who do come out can do is change those stereotypes
7314208 i think the fact that not that many athletes feel comfortable coming out is one of the reasons why the stereotype has endured
7314209 estoy muy feliz de fichar por el udinese un club importante que ha conseguido grandes resultados en los ltimos a os tenemos un equipo joven y con talento y yo tratar de aportar mi experiencia y ayudar en todo lo que pueda a mis j venes compa eros

7314212 persona non grata em espanha por ter abalroado fernando alonso logo na primeira volta
7314213 its nice to win knowing that i had to play well and then actually doing it
7314214 i had two weeks to try to impress nick the first is out of the way and i seem to have done that
7314215 i dont know if i have done enough but im going to gleneagles in better shape and hopefully he will take notice
7314216 it was a good effort but all credit to darren
7314217 there are only two picks so its a tight situation but im going to have to win in scotland to give myself a chance
7314218 yes thats where i was supposed to go thats what i had planned
7314219 we dont even bother to hope anymore that somebody will come to protect us
7314220 they dont come out and say they want us off the land but they are forcing us off
7314221 they put a kalashnikov to my chest and said do you have money gold or a car
7314222 i started crying and one of them said dont worry we wont do anything wrong to you
7314223 the militias are still coming theyre still driving through and robbing us
7314224 when cars come through were just hiding there is nobody to protect us and were very scared
7314225 nach dem abtritt ihres gemeinsamen feindes musharraf k nnen sie ihre allianz nicht mehr aufrechterhalten
7314226 sonst bleibt uns keine wahl als der gang in die opposition
7314227 mit einem immer beliebteren sharif als oppositionschef w re die regierung viel wackeliger
7314228 verschlechtert sich dadurch wirtschafts und sicherheitslage weiter k nnte sich das milit r erneut als retter der nation aufspielen
7314229 wir m ssen uns die zuverl ssigkeit genau ansehen ich bin zuversichtlich dass das team wei welche gegenma nahmen man treffen kann um auf dieses problem zu reagieren so wie es das fr her schon immer gemacht hat
7314230 ich glaube aber nicht dass ich trotz dieses schlechten ergebnisses aus dem titelrennen bin es sind noch sechs rennen zu fahren und 60 punkte zu holen wir haben gesehen wie schnell sich die situation ndern kann auch wenn mir klar ist dass die dinge nun schwieriger sind
7314231 es war mein fehler und leider bin ich ber denjenigen gefahren der getankt hat wir m ssen schauen was da wirklich passiert ist
7314232 zum gl ck ist piero timpini nicht zu viel passiert ich w nsche ihm das beste und hoffe es geht ihm bald besser
7314233 es war nur in der letzten kurve leider wei ich nicht was da passiert ist aber wir m ssen untersuchen was mit dem motor nicht gestimmt hat vielleicht ist es hnlich dem was felipe im vorigen rennen passiert ist
7314234 wir wissen was die probleme waren aber leider konnten wir sie noch nicht l sen hoffentlich k nnen wir das jetzt im n chsten test abarbeiten und eine l sung finden wenn wir das qualifying richtig hinbekommen wird das viel helfen
7314235 der vorschlag von frau von der leyen ist kontraproduktiv weil er die chancengleichheit unter den krankenkassen aush hlt
7314236 das bisherige system krankt doch daran dass die kassen nur noch darum konkurrieren wer die meisten jungen gesunden patienten hat wer jetzt zum kassenwechsel aus rein finanziellen motiven aufruft f rdert diesen ungesunden wettbewerb noch was wir brauchen ist ein gesunder wettbewerb um die beste versorgung der patienten
7314237 nur empfehlen schauen sie ihrer krankenkasse genau auf die finger und wechseln sie die kasse wenn sie mehr geld von ihnen verlangt die auswahl ist gro genug
7314238 jede kasse bekommt denselben betrag pro versicherten damit h rt die jagd nach den jungen besserverdienenden auf und jede kasse kann zeigen was sie mit dem geld ihrer versicherten macht
7314239 es besteht die gefahr dass eine solche ballung die kassen berlastet
7314240 georgien und auch die ukraine werden mitglieder der nato sein
7314241 angesichts der angespannten lage kommen wir nicht ohne eine verst rkung der friedenssoldaten aus

7314244 die firma kellogs lie extra kleine computerspiele programmieren deren codes man dann auf der verpackung fand oder die als diskette auf messen verteilt wurden
7314245 die sogenannten promotionspiele wurden vor allem in den 90er jahren beliebt allen voran das im auftrag von phenomedia programmierte spiel moorhuhn
7314246 both on the field of play and off this will go down as one of the greatest performances ever for a united states olympic team
7314247 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7314248 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7314249 its much more difficult for the rest of the world to compete but thats the way it should be

7314289 we are helping increase the quality of life for many of the people who could otherwise not afford prescription glasses
7314290 there have been instances where iraqis have gotten themselves in a life threatening situation because they could not read the warning signs so we are potentially saving lives
7314291 they dont have a proper hospital where they can go to be treated
7314292 the clinic they do have is lacking medical supplies such as glasses and the facilities to treat some of the more severe eyesight problems
7314293 the local optometrist will be handing out most of the glasses for free

7314298 these guys are doing an amazing job keeping the area secure
7314299 it shows that we can unite iraqis and endorse teamwork and build camaraderie
7314300 i think the iraqi government are realizing that disabled citizens can be integrated into society and can play a productive role in society
7314301 they are providing special education classes meant to help increase awareness and wellness to reach the population
7314302 the ngos are doing their part to help educate iraqi men and women using programs such as the youth sport centers to help address those needs
7314303 it also shows great leaps and bound in the fact that they have become self sufficient as a whole and want to better themselves and their community

7314315 it was not a great weekend but it is not the first time we are in a bit of a worse situation in the championship but if we get all the things sorted then i think we still have a chance to come back
7314316 we know what the issues have been but unfortunately we havent been able to sort them out hopefully now in the next test we can work a bit and try to find the solution for it if we get the qualifying right it will help a lot
7314317 we still have faith in him of course he is a world champion and we are a loyal team

7314336 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
7314337 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
7314338 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
7314339 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
7314340 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do

7314343 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7314344 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7314345 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7314346 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7314347 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
7314348 tremendous groundbreaking figure everyone admires her greatly he is going to need her in the senate
7314349 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7314350 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old
7314351 the convention will give us an opportunity to reach out to those people hillary is going to be 100 percent for him

7314365 theyre drinking the kool aid that somehow i have changed positions on the issues all i can say is that we all grow we all grow wiser and we all refine our positions
7314366 you cant win making those type of mistakes and thats all of us

7314374 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7314375 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7314376 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7314377 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out
7314378 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7314379 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7314380 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7314381 i just want to study and be with my mom
7314382 a lot of guys try to run the same game that they ran over there but they end up falling on their face

7314466 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7314467 if you could go up to someone random and tell them what you thought about them would you
7314468 i know a lot more than you think youre a coward at heart you cant even tell your brother what you think of him you think saying shit to a random stranger will be any different
7314469 because somebody needs to tell you the fucking truth once in a while and if you wont tell yourself then ill do it for you

7314479 its funny everybody seems to think youll have an afterlife experience your whole life will flash before your eyes
7314480 i initially thought my rifle had exploded because i couldnt see out of my left eye and my safety glasses had blown off and my helmet had blown off
7314481 when i looked into the ground i just saw blood pouring into the dirt and realized something had gone really really wrong
7314482 i was having difficulty seeing out of my eye and obviously losing a lot of blood
7314483 it wasnt until probably about five minutes later when i was getting patched up by the corpsman that they realized the bullet had actually struck the side of my rifle and skimmed into my left temple the rifle took the brunt of the blast and thats pretty much what saved my life
7314484 there was a 10 year old boy who had been shot in the arm and the shoulder and his father who had been shot in the stomach
7314485 we were able to pull the civilians out of their vehicle get them initial treatment and then i loaded them into the back of my humvee and drove back to the surgical center on camp fallujah
7314486 there are a lot of differences between there and here but the hearts and minds aspect of our work is the same
7314487 the orphanage was amazing the kids were so grateful for everything weve done for them
7314488 we love interacting with the locals that live around the job site and learning a little bit about their culture
7314489 the country is beautiful and the people have been very thankful and welcoming we enjoy being in a different country helping those that are less fortunate
7314490 i would say the welcome we received in iraq was different in that we were needed to sustain life there a lot of humanitarian aid we conducted in fallujah was providing food for people immediate medical assistance and things along those lines they were depending on our ability to be able to take care of them
7314491 there are a lot worse things in life to worry about than a traffic jam or your cell phone bill being overdue
7314492 when you realize there are a lot of people dealing with a lot harder time in life in a lot more difficult situations but they can still persevere
7314493 zur bek mpfung des machtwillens der v ter dieser welt
7314494 wenn mir eine zeitschrift l ngere zeit hindurch verlockend erschien so war es die von dr gross deshalb weil sie mir wenigstens an jenem abend aus einem feuer einer gewissen pers nlichen verbundenheit hervorzugehen schien
7314495 it is clear that the bnp led four party alliance government was behind the deadly grenade attack we want the caretaker government to unearth the real culprits through neutral investigation and bring them to trial
7314496 the members of bandhu sabha want to build a strong democracy in the country they work to help establish rule of law in the country and are always found to be against injustice and they always come forward to help during disasters like acid violence floods and cyclones
7314497 i expect this body will become a powerful social organisation and build a new and better bangladesh
7314498 to make the country free from all kinds of corruption bandhu sabha members will march ahead with hasan mashhud chowdhury in the leadership
7314499 the spirit and determination i see in the youth of today gives me the courage to continue my job
7314500 we fired up a couple of engines listened to the old
7314501 it was such an old workhorse and because i was so young then
7314502 it was nice talking to old war veterans who flew them
7314503 if we can get just price for our gas we dont need to borrow from donors to undertake development projects
7314504 the company now provides 700 mmcfd gas from different gas fields it owns of these titas field supplies around 400 mmcfd as the main provider
7314505 given the nature of the company an annual net earning of tk 150 crore might not be a big deal sometimes development work might need huge investment forcing the bgfcl to resort to donors
7314506 this gas company has given so much to the nation it is time the nation helps this company grow further
7314507 but you can still see gas leakage there are gas bubbles in the titas river this time however the emitted gas is nothing but gas that remained charged underground due to the past leakage perhaps there are some other undetected problems with the field we are monitoring all the wells and data shows no anomaly in the producing wells
7314508 i should say the fields condition is not as dangerous as it had been
7314509 we believe the three dimensional survey now being undertaken will reveal whatever faults this field has developed we can take remedial actions after that otherwise it is impossible to address this leakage problem
7314510 but such conditions of the government are not acceptable to khaleda zia even people wont accept those
7314511 the amendments have been made to keep the four party alliance away from the election process
7314512 we the four party alliance reject the ordinance rpo the next general election will be illegal if it is held under it
7314513 sheikh hasina is free but khaleda zia is behind bars tarique rahmans condition is deteriorating he has not been released for medical treatment although many others with minor complications have been freed
7314514 we are worried that he tarique is partially paralysed the government will have to bear all responsibility
7314515 ooo look at me im making people happy im the magical man from happyland in a gumdrop house on lollypop laaaaaaane
7314516 we are taking urgent measures to get the matter heard before the courts vacation begins we will try our best to dispel the prevailing uncertainty over the poll following the stay order
7314517 workers who ask for their proper wages are beaten and threatened with arrest and deportation they are housed in squalid overcrowded dorms with eight workers sharing a 10 by 10 foot room sleeping on narrow double level metal bunk beds
7314518 it would be a horrible turn of events if operation desert storm and all the sacrifices made by us troops have in some way freed kuwait to traffic in hundreds of thousands of foreign guest workers who are stripped of their passports forced to work long hours cheated of their wages and then beaten and deported when they ask that their most basic rights be respected
7314519 we have identified border areas vulnerable to trans border crime
7314520 it was an isolated incident this is simply ridiculous this aberration should not have happened i apologies for that and we are carrying out an enquiry we will take action against the fellows
7314521 the bdr and the bsf guard more than 4 000km of border and therefore it would be quite unreasonable to expect that nothing is going to happen on this long border guarded by more than 100 000 armed people on both sides
7314522 however as far as this incident is concerned i can only say that it is highly regrettable it should not have happened
7314523 to improve the situation even further we have a plan to set up a drainage line to begunbari canal from siddheswari via moghbazar
7314524 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7314525 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down
7314526 it feels good to make history here it feels good to make history for kenya and win the gold
7314527 more than 40 world records were set more than 100 olympic records and of course we had the two icons of the games michael phelps and usain bolt
7314528 it is extremely difficult to know for sure how many people were caught up in the avalanche
7314529 thanks to technology we know for certain there are people buried under the snow but its impossible to be sure exactly how many
7314530 a wall of ice coming towards us and then we were carried 200 metres yards
7314531 its probable according to statements made to us that groups of climbers roped together were on the path up the mountain as well as in the place where the block of ice tumbled down
7314532 weve succeeded to collect around 20 percent of hazardous waste so far bringing 272 hospitals clinics and diagnostic centres under our network
7314533 the success is not so high as 17 government hospitals in the city generating most of the waste are still out of our management
7314534 if everything goes well well start our waste collection work at dmch from october 1
7314535 we keep four buckets of four colours in each hospital and clinic where the waste is dumped
7314536 and what do you pay for watermelons this time of year
7314537 oh about 2 cents a pound sometimes 1 cent a pound
7314538 little boy youre lying to me youre lying youre lying
7314539 it aint what you dont know that causes problems its what you do know that just aint so
7314540 i would like to introduce you to the president of the international federation of tuba players john jones
7314541 i would like to introduce you to john jones president of the international federation of tuba players
7314542 you may have noticed that many of the paragraphs are quite short
7314543 particle physics and differential topology are not easy subjects but german is impossible i spend more time and effort on this class and get less out of it than any other class i have
7314544 at last a language i will actually be able to use
7314545 but this makes no sense how can you understand them when i cant
7314546 i guess i just listen to what they are saying
7314547 it was like being released from prison i saw my cell door swinging open and my mind being set free to fly out i could literally feel my brain expanding
7314548 i used to be jealous of people who learned other languages as a child not as an adult but now im not so certain i was 24 before i learned a second language it wasnt easy in fact it was excruciatingly difficult however i had an experience that people who grow up speaking other languages cannot even begin to imagine looking back on it i dont think i would really want to change that
7314549 es ist immer rgerlich wenn man das 2 0 macht und dann zu schnell den anschlusstreffer kassiert das 1 2 hat den wolfsburgern wieder mumm gegeben
7314550 ich ordne das ergebnis als punktverlust ein wir haben nach der pause zu viele klare chancen vergeben als dass ich zufrieden sein k nnte
7314551 wir haben nach dem 1 2 die k pfe h ngen gelassen das darf nicht passieren
7314552 wir sind auf einem ganz guten weg die mannschaft hat ber weite strecken berzeugt
7314553 wir sind nicht zu hochkar tigen chancen gekommen daran m ssen wir arbeiten
7314554 wir haben nicht richtig gut gespielt aber einen wichtigen punkt geholt
7314555 the facts are clear i mean edwards solicited money and he wasnt telling the truth to the people he was soliciting it from he kept soliciting money and saying his bonking hunter wasnt true i would think that they it might be a pretty good class action suit
7314556 we have directed our militants to stop attacks against the government and security forces in bajaur from today
7314557 the jirga elders council insisted that taliban should stop fighting in the interest of the people of bajaur
7314558 we are ready for talks with the government and the truce is an important development towards dialogue
7314559 by the grace of god this will be done that is the judgment against bhutto and zardari and then both of us will go to him nawaz sharif and seek forgiveness
7314560 nous ne nous reconnaissons pas dans une europe qui accompagne le lib ralisme au lieu de le r guler qui ne prot ge plus contre les d rives de la mondialisation et les exc s du march qui laisse g rer leuro sur de seuls objectifs financiers et non au service de la croissance et de lemploi

7314565 nous avons le droit et le devoir de prot ger notre mod le social et nos normes environnementales face un pays continent qui ne les respecte absolument pas en n gociant des montants compensatoires avec la chine nous chercherons non pas casser sa croissance ce que ferait une politique b tement protectionniste mais inciter et aider les dirigeants chinois changer de mod le de croissance au lieu de miser essentiellement sur les exportations et sur linvestissement il faut au moins le temps dune transition que la croissance chinoise soit tir e par la consommation int rieure ce qui suppose daugmenter les salaires de cr er un syst me de s curit sociale de d velopper le syst me ducatif et les programmes de sauvegarde de lenvironnement

7314576 poor farm girl cant drive in the big scary city
7314577 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7314578 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7314579 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7314580 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7314581 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7314582 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7314583 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7314584 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7314585 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should ben affleck be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us
7314586 why shouldnt he be in denver he has nothing to be ashamed of
7314587 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps
7314588 i dont think oprah hurts i think she helps a lot
7314589 they havent called but if they need me im on a plane whatever they want
7314590 the athletes were never expected to carry the water for the activists it is a matter of individual conscience
7314591 ultimately it is more of an indictment of the atmosphere of intimidation and censorship imposed by the chinese government not to mention the confusing messages
7314592 id suspect a major reason for this is that olympic athletes see the games as a once in lifetime opportunity to shine in their sport stand out and possibly cash in
7314593 its a moment that theyve been training and preparing for all their lives and to risk tarnishing all their hard work with a protest or political statement just isnt worth it
7314594 the goal was not to stick a finger in chinas eye but rather to raise world consciousness about how china underwrites mass slaughter as a way to urge the international community to intercede with beijing
7314595 i just want to study and be with my mom
7314596 a lot of guys try to run the same game that they ran over there but they end up falling on their face
7314597 you see we know spanish but we dont know the exact words and when we try to explain to somebody something theyre like huh
7314598 they shouldnt have deported you so soon after your surgery
7314599 i cant walk both my feet are in bad shape
7314600 finish high school and then you can come here at least here you have your grandparents your cousins over there what do you have
7314601 they deport them at any hour at 10 p m at midnight and in some cases they wind up in the street or they sleep in the offices of mexican immigration agents
7314602 to try our best not to bring women or juveniles after dark
7314603 i dont know how but im going to make it
7314604 its a noble thing that they want the family to be reunited but they are exposing them to danger
7314605 i just want to go back to michoacan with my mom
7314606 im very proud weve done as well as we have i had to be here today its such a momentous occasion
7314607 when it comes to the olympics theyre just brilliant they bring out the best in everyone theyre just such a happy event
7314608 it means a lot that london has them its something to be proud of instead of just moaning about the country its time to strike out and show what we can do
7314609 were not going to be able to compete with all the amazing graphics beijing has done but in our own way it will be equally good
7314610 if we can maintain that funding and get more investment that would be great
7314611 the more people start thinking positively and start promoting the london olympics as a positive thing the more successful theyre going to be
7314612 theyre going to be good for business good for development and infrastructure in the long term there will be all the facilities which we wouldnt have if we didnt have the olympics
7314613 its a once in a lifetime thing for it to be in my country im so very proud
7314614 we should be positive weve waited for years for it to come back people just need to get behind it and support their country
7314615 the tube is already so crowded i cant imagine it then with all the tourists coming over it will be a nightmare
7314616 if its out there and you can get it you know go ahead
7314617 we refuse to be silent we are going to speak our minds the whole world is watching
7314618 en tout cas je nai pas demand ta t te
7314619 ill do whatever i like ill do whatever i like i can do i can do i do i do whatever i like what i want ill do whatever i like ill do whatever i like i can do i can do i do i do whatever i like
7314620 the journalists were reported to have been returning from the afgoye idp internally displaced people area and men with firearms ordered the journalists to leave with them
7314621 step amp repeat the best amp worst of vma fashion
7314622 its like playing barbie but with giant huge full grown models
7314623 you know imma let em have that right quick right
7314624 somewhere theres a bald horse running around in a field
7314625 just wanted to do something that would say look at her
7314626 saving forest creatures by collecting excessive packaging and recycling it
7314627 women are delaying their childbearing until they complete their educations
7314628 this is the first time weve looked at a lot of these characteristics
7314629 that to me is counter intuitive because a large share of our poor population is latino and they tend to have higher birth rates
7314630 tend to be two parent families and overwhelmingly working and because if youre undocumented youre not eligible for cash assistance programs
7314631 are just not going to good schools and no incentive is going to fix that
7314632 theres a lot of buzz about pay for performance but we still only have a small amount of studies on these programs and a lot of them dont come from the u s
7314633 i think hes done a very careful job of doing the evaluation
7314634 if we are going to invest why dont we invest in something that we know does work like reducing class size or extended learning time
7314635 are just not going to good schools and no incentive is going to fix that
7314636 its definitely piqued more interest in ap classes than it has in the past
7314637 im not pollyannish it is not going to happen overnight but its certainly our goal
7314638 its harder than we thought it was going to be
7314639 obama approached it in a very serious sober and reasoned way
7314640 fuimos superiores y pod amos haber ganado por m s goles
7314641 jugamos mal adem s que el rbitro conspir contra nosotros
7314642 kelly shoppach and ryan garko will likely be the odd men out
7314643 my guess is that sal fasano and andy gonzalez will be the odd men out
7314644 why did the browns fall short of the playoffs last season
7314645 hafner is done he will never play well in this league again
7314646 i was keeping goods there and they didnt let me bring them out i lost about 850 000 dollars and they even used 7 000 boxes of cheese for protection on the roof
7314647 the work has improved the markets have opened iraqi traders are dealing with other companies directly
7314648 i left the country because of the violence but now that it is more secure i will return to live in baghdad at the end of this month
7314649 it is the first time in six conferences we are talking about actual projects before we were always discussing
7314650 we are at the beginning we would like to establish the good basics to start and actually there are some plans started but there are still few
7314651 we have very big strategic plans in iraq which include electricity and oil and the refineries and also other factories which will bring good benefits to iraq
7314652 arrests and violations of the nfl conduct code have become an unfortunate trend amongst the leagues players
7314653 and its an excellent way for us to make some money
7314654 5 is your friend and teammate braylon edwards plotting some sort of revenge after gashing his foot a couple weeks ago nah laughs hes just working to get back he will be fine hes taking care of his foot and he will be ready soon

7314689 why am i still wearing clothes not having sex with this person is not an option
7314690 sometimes a counterattack played from midfield can also be spectacular
7314691 having played against strong opponents always away from home will prove useful later on when in the champions league we will face teams who play differently from italian teams
7314692 even though we havent scored a lot we always created chances just think about figos three chances and ibras chance in the match against benfica sometimes ive thought why cant we ever score more than one goal but im convinced the goals will come lets not forget each new project is based on defensive solidity i would sign for many 1 0 victories
7314693 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
7314694 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
7314695 o ouro foi para a melhor equipe da competi o os estados unidos foram um dos times que evolu ram muito nos ltimos cinco anos junto com a bulg ria e a r ssia e n o conseguimos suportar a press o eles nos estudaram muito jogamos durante oito anos da mesma maneira ramos a equipe a ser batida e eles descobriram alguns de nossos segredos
7314696 eles sempre foram uma pedra no nosso sapato e tiveram um volume de jogo muito bom nesses jogos contra os eua perdemos um pouco a paci ncia
7314697 seriously bec look at me like that again and i will smack you down bitch
7314698 i think they are going to it way too many times its the original story that defined john mccain but now it not only defines him its become a crutch in the campaign and i think he is in danger of trivializing it by the time they get to the convention in st paul there might not be much of it left to use
7314699 i think they are going to it way too many times its the original story that defined john mccain that still when you read it in his book faith of my fathers when you read about it in the nightingales song you cant help but have admiration and respect for the guy and i think he wisely for many years stayed away from it as a political tool he really did but now it not only defines him its become a crutch in the campaign and i think he is in danger of trivializing it by the time they get to the convention in st paul there might not be much of it left to use

7314703 it is amazing reading is legendary and for us to be here again is an honour an a privilege the great thing about this festival is that the crowds are always mad we love that we feed off that for us every show we do is a personal thing the british audience have always been amazing and supportive theres so much excitement with the new album and to show what weve got it feels like a new challenge for us

7314707 by choosing joe biden as their vice presidential candidate the democrats have selected a politician with a mixed record on technology who has spent most of his senate career allied with the fbi and copyright holders who ranks toward the bottom of cnets technology voters guide and whose anti privacy legislation was actually responsible for the creation of pgp

7314737 ive had a great relationship in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7314738 it is my hope that my republican colleagues will engage in this election and help match what the democrats are doing
7314739 i am pleased that following the surge strategy led by general david petraeus and our brave men and women in uniform security in iraq has improved to the point at which we can responsibly talk with our iraqi allies about u
7314740 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
7314741 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
7314742 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
7314743 im leaning more towards obama and thats because of both oprahs support and what ive seen of him
7314744 celebrities dont have to worry about family budgets but we sure do were paying more for food and gas making it harder to save for college retirement

7314778 hey dont buy vista 64bit its slow and it has no drivers for anything
7314779 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7314780 of course its possible to prepare a forecast with any lead time you like whether or nor that forecast has any accuracy or usable skill is another question
7314781 the world is watching and they are waiting for us and they are waiting to see what were made of
7314782 i think well just keep it up there and keep marketing it until someone comes forth
7314783 hopefully it will find a new owner who has both the interest and ability to take care of it and respect its historic integrity
7314784 jag r inte stum jag har bara tappat r sten s du kan sluta glo nu tack
7314785 wait till the cake comes out the kitchen before you eat it thats like a kid who sees his toys before christmas it takes away from me and i think it takes away from the fans as well when its time imma give it to you they leaked my record with me and
7314786 we believe that a party platform is a covenant with the people to be faithfully kept by the party entrusted with power
7314787 this is a lesson to us ministers that we must always look after the poor and unfortunate in the society
7314788 it was a tough competition but navuloa stood above the rest and was declared the winner
7314789 its becoming clear that the church will continue to reject the charter
7314790 the church cannot condone and will not support something illegal from the beginning and we cant change that
7314791 because the information system has improved a lot it has changed the world quickly and the ministers have to be aware and understand the impact of changes to the people
7314792 the globe which we use to see as the big globe now becomes the global village what happens on the other side of the world is clear on the other end
7314793 this is the cutting edge of the 21st century and i believe the ministers of today should be ministering in the 21st century context not similar to the 20th century
7314794 niu saravi ira na mai lagasere au raica na kedra rairai vinaka na noda marama niu raici ira na noda turaga au raica na nodra dravukasi
7314795 na tamata lotu e dodonu me bulataka na bula savasava
7314796 in other words hes the medium for life hes the ambassador of life and good living of the gospel
7314797 people should be convinced of the good living that we try to preach and this good living is not only spiritual but holistic in its understanding
7314798 it means good living healthy body healthy mind and healthy spirit
7314799 so we cannot keep on preaching and our body is not healthy when it consumes a lot of kava and smoking
7314800 thank you so much for the fabulous weekend of creativity the class was very well organized and we were extremely impressed
7314801 it was one of the best art experiences ive ever had i truly enjoyed myself
7314802 when the stretcher bearers go out you do worry but it was not as bad as it looked
7314803 now that i have won i see myself in a better position to reach out to the people effectively there are several community projects i have in mind and i am hoping to work on these with other contestants as well we will be meeting soon and we have to talk about how to do the fundraising and get moving with the projects
7314804 it is true that the petitioner expressly acknowledged in the first caution statement that he knew that his daughter could lose her life through the injuries she received
7314805 the record caution statement includes the sentence i know that the injuries which she received can cause her death and i am asking for forgiveness
7314806 but each statement went to his state of mind at the time of the respective caution interview nothing was asked and nothing said about his state of mind as to the probable effect of the injuries he was inflicting
7314807 three weeks after i was sentenced i escaped i had nowhere to go so thats where the robberies began and escalated to more serious crimes over the years each time i was sentenced i escaped spent a few weeks outside committed more robberies got caught and got my sentence extended
7314808 my parents separated when i was six months old and my mother raised me my father lived close by but i was never told who he was until i was 12 once i was sentenced i thought that was the end of the road for me and that was where i was destined to be
7314809 you cant imagine how grateful i am to the commissioner for the first time now i am looking forward to coming out and starting a life i want to save as much as i can while i am inside so that i wont have to depend on anybody and take care of myself when i get out
7314810 nowadays i sleep and think screen printing thats all i think about
7314811 the current issue with air fiji is a contractual matter between air fiji and air bp
7314812 we have been coping well in the weekend we had to pull office workers and they included those at headquarters and even those in the police band
7314813 it not only included manpower but all vehicles made available at central police station
7314814 we will upgrade sanitation facilities and water systems in the villages
7314815 i am still looking through the areas to upgrade living standard that the funding will accommodate
7314816 i plead to the provinces to please allow the people to make up their own minds with the information given to them the have a right to know and decide we should not be dictators
7314817 we strongly believe that fijis economic future and well being lies in the tourism industry
7314818 as a born and bred kai lautoka the sugar capital of fiji and one who has seen the rise and lately drop in sugar cane production i can frankly state that our younger generation have turned their back on sugar cane farming
7314819 this is where i feel the tourism industry will effectively need and has the capacity to fill the vacuum created by the sugar industry
7314820 it will provide employment create other cottage industries to support hotels and resorts and it will encourage other agricultural activities to meet the demand of the tourism industry such as local vegetables and fruits
7314821 so i say this again tourism is the only sector that is poised to thrive in fiji period
7314822 this is my hometown i grew up here the same friends i grew up with have turned their heads away
7314823 nobody wants to give me space to operate a roadside stall
7314824 i dont sell marijuana i just sell fruits and vegetables at very affordable price compared to other stores in flagstaff
7314825 the officer at the police post knows this very well
7314826 this is a good case of seeing that fijians living abroad care so much about the people here
7314827 it is a gift we appreciate from the indian community who care for everyone and not just the indians
7314828 the items will be distributed in the larger suva area and parts of naitasiri because we know a number of people in need there
7314829 the station was set obviously not to make money and we are always keen to help our brothers and sisters in need here
7314830 when we heard about cyclone gene we did a 24 hour appeal for two months and the response was just overwhelming we even had people come in to help from outside hamilton
7314831 we welcome the improvements made at the prisons and to the remand centres we also welcome programs aimed at rehabilitation
7314832 as more work projects can be identified by social welfare department with the backing of firm supervision the courts will be able to pass sentences of community service instead of prison for lesser offences and for first offenders
7314833 we welcome this joint effort and are grateful for this australian input in this way
7314834 we dont expect the situation to deteriorate but we would be remiss in our duty not have a plan in place in the event the situation did deteriorate
7314835 if however the airport at nadi was closed then we would have to consider whether a military evacuation by air or by sea was necessary
7314836 we would work with what ever government was in place in fiji to try to get their concurrence if that was not possible then in the last instance the lives and the well being of our citizens would be paramount and we would do it with or without that concurrence
7314837 i have authorised a comprehensive study of loss of fishing rights and environmental impact of this project
7314838 i am now engaged in negotiations with the landowners to convert the compensation money into shares in natadola resort for the long term benefit and substantial returns to the landowners
7314839 through shareholding the landowners will have a sense of ownership commitment and belonging to this project
7314840 as asked we provided extensive written comments on the ministerial contact group report ahead of the niue meeting
7314841 however we were compelled to refrain from travelling to niue because of one reason alone the action taken by the new zealand government to exclude fiji from the post forum consultations
7314842 and that the fiji delegation had not been granted proper visas to attend these meetings
7314843 we have been so divided politically and in other ways particularly over the past seven years that the people of fiji are saying enough is enough that it is now time we moved seriously to unite our nation
7314844 we have allocated a period of six weeks for intensive consultations at local and grass roots level
7314845 i am prepared to extend the time for consultations should that be necessary
7314846 i appreciate what prison wardens are doing most of us were inside because of the lack of money
7314847 what they are doing is trying to create employment giving them education carpentry practical theory and rehabilitation
7314848 but the problem now is who is there to receive the former prisoner
7314849 all these doors have been closed down by the government itself
7314850 where is he or she going to take their talents when government is shutting down doors thats how we look at it from behind bars
7314851 if i had my way in the budget i would double the budget for the prison department for the manpower and facilities also increase the wages of prison officers
7314852 rather than trying to solve the situation after it happens
7314853 ex prisoners need second chances and can contribute back to society
7314854 josefa baleiloa is a result of a beating we question what happened instead of asking what caused the vicious cycles
7314855 if you try to solve the problem within the result we find out it cannot be solved
7314856 they approached me because there are some terms of reference that the councils cant answer
7314857 thats where i come in thats the terms of reference of review
7314858 mr gavidi has been involved in municipal councils for more than 30 years and we feel he is the best qualified person to assist us in this exercise
7314859 what to do with a check payable to an estate
7314860 if i contract you to sell my home can you sell it without putting a sign in my yard
7314861 it is their festival and ours so we thought it would be a good idea for all of us to step in to do the cleaning we also had several committee members
7314862 we were keen to get involved because we wanted to contribute effectively to the mother of all festivals
7314863 we have club members their family friends and church members to help out in the cleaning
7314864 we even have teachers from overseas and all small islands who came all the way to join us in this milestone achievement in our history
7314865 the figures dont tally government employs only a certain number of teachers in a year according to the money they get they dont look at the number of children in schools
7314866 does this person appear committed and dedicated to putting in the time and effort required to build a life together
7314867 do we share similar goals and a relationship vision that will allow us to work together as a team
7314868 which intellectual emotional physical and spiritual needs do i want met in a relationship are these compatible with my partners needs
7314869 education is the path from cocky ignorance to miserable uncertainty

7314883 dan kini sesuai dengan tradisi saya menyatakan olimpiade ke 29 ditutup dan saya memanggil pada atlet atlet muda dunia untuk berkumpul empat tahun dari sekarang di london untuk merayakan olimpiade ke 30

7314896 we recognise the careful and studied process undergone in bougainville which is hailed as a success and took up to eight years in planning consensus building and consultation
7314897 change however high minded cannot be fast tracked in a society without devastating upheavals
7314898 they must evolve from the grassroots up or they will inevitably fail inflicting damage in unintended consequences
7314899 language that is clear specific can be tested for truth and corroborated with evidence
7314900 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7314901 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7314902 we have to reach out to other people who dont know the word of god we should serve rather than people serving us
7314903 my father was a lay preacher back then i made a promise that i will follow his footsteps and continue to preach the word of god
7314904 we are known to be kai vanuabalavu because of that name
7314905 i dont want to burden church members for i have a duty to serve
7314906 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7314907 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7314908 i obviously had scored i dont know if they werent watching or what
7314909 thats one of the things i hate about this sport
7314910 bringing out the hardcover last year during the hectic lead in to the primaries didnt help the book because it was perceived by some to be a campaign tool its actually a fine and moving memoir
7314911 they keep talking about rivalries we might have one now
7314912 that was one of those deals where i couldnt get by him
7314913 i had to ask myself would he do that to me and he has before and thats the way it goes
7314914 i just kind of ran into him thats what happened i have a lot of respect for the guy and he was real fast but we cant give up points when theyre right there for us to take
7314915 no because he does that and hell always come back and say hes sorry
7314916 he did it at milwaukee in the nationwide series and hes done it a few other times its just his normal fashion thats fine ive grown to know that

7314918 i like my spotter hes a good guy but man this is ridiculous
7314919 we took a bunch of cars out for no reason i was just running along heard clear clear clear and went up and there was someone still there we just took out a bunch of cars for no reason and ourselves
7314920 we had a good racecar and its a shame we got caught up in that mess
7314921 i just saw cars wrecking in front of me and there was nothing i could do
7314922 i tried to get him back but i thought better of it and tried to pull down and pass him back but i didnt have a good enough car to stick and denny got to his outside and he got by me and then i had to battle with him hamlin toward the end
7314923 the groups operating in europe dont need a lot of money the cost of operations is very low
7314924 but they are very skilled at obtaining money and using criminal systems to do it they can collect thousands and thousands of dollars or euros in a few weeks it is beyond our control
7314925 the united states and its allies have been winning the war on the financial front
7314926 in the first half the company improved its management mechanism established a professional marketing strategy and continued to optimize business structure which helped cipc to reap hefty profit and premiums
7314927 but you should just know about the unpredictable attacks you shouldve just seen them coming
7314928 just kill all thirty of those enemies in the two seconds before they hit you with their completely unblockable and dominating attacks
7314929 with a brilliant smile and the early facial creases of happy dissipation he was known for being cranky curious passive aggressive and most of all persnickety
7314930 i had to save ourselves because if i had not driven to the right side of the road we both could have died because the truck would have fallen down the cliff
7314931 the other passenger received a gush on the top of his head and we rushed him to hospital as soon as the truck fell to its side after it tumbled
7314932 joder un chico que sabe espanol y con iphone una maravilla
7314933 sonst h tten wir auch aus dieser krise nichts gelernt
7314934 der vorschlag von frau von der leyen ist kontraproduktiv weil er die chancengleichheit unter den krankenkassen aush hlt
7314935 das bisherige system krankt doch daran dass die kassen nur noch darum konkurrieren wer die meisten jungen gesunden patienten hat wer jetzt zum kassenwechsel aus rein finanziellen motiven aufruft f rdert diesen ungesunden wettbewerb noch was wir brauchen ist ein gesunder wettbewerb um die beste versorgung der patienten
7314936 nur empfehlen schauen sie ihrer krankenkasse genau auf die finger und wechseln sie die kasse wenn sie mehr geld von ihnen verlangt die auswahl ist gro genug
7314937 jede kasse bekommt denselben betrag pro versicherten damit h rt die jagd nach den jungen besserverdienenden auf und jede kasse kann zeigen was sie mit dem geld ihrer versicherten macht
7314938 es besteht die gefahr dass eine solche ballung die kassen berlastet
7314939 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7314940 of course its possible to prepare a forecast with any lead time you like whether or nor that forecast has any accuracy or usable skill is another question
7314941 there is no way a competitor could produce times like that unaided
7314942 are almost exactly mapped by the function of a 3rd degree poly nomial
7314943 its business as usual with do nothings and know nothings at city hall
7314944 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7314945 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7314946 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7314947 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7314948 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
7314949 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie

7314959 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7314960 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7314961 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7314962 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7314963 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7314964 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7314965 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7314966 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7314967 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7314968 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7314969 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7314970 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7314971 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7314972 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7314973 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7314974 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7314975 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7314976 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7314977 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7314978 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7314979 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7314980 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales

7314982 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7314983 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7314984 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7314985 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7314986 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7314987 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7314988 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7314989 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7314990 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7314991 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7314992 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7314993 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7314994 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7314995 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7314996 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7314997 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7314998 estoy satisfecho con la segunda posici n tengo un gran equipo
7314999 mccain has widened his lead and seems to have gained a bit of an upper hand in nevada
7315000 its still early and theres a lot that is going to happen before the election in november but coming out of the gate mccain is in the lead
7315001 nevada and new mexico are the two western states people thought would be most likely to go from red to blue but here it looks like nevadas actually less likely than colorado
7315002 what struck me is that obamas negatives are much higher than mccains
7315003 obama maybe has suffered a bit of overexposure lately and that shift dovetails pretty closely with the mccain lead
7315004 comes down to senator mccain being a western senator he understands the issues he has lived the issues every day of his life
7315005 were going to continue talking to voters about senator obamas message of change in washington and the evidence weve seen is that nevadans are responding to it
7315006 it contains appeals not to observe laws of non muslim states and russia is a non muslim state to liquidate peoples with other religious convictions
7315007 underlying the inability of men and women to communicate is a deeper truth all people are essentially alone
7315008 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7315009 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7315010 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7315011 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7315012 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7315013 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7315014 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7315015 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7315016 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7315017 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7315018 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7315019 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7315020 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7315021 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7315022 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7315023 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7315024 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
7315025 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
7315026 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7315027 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7315028 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7315029 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7315030 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7315031 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
7315032 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
7315033 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7315034 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7315035 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7315036 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7315037 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

7315040 i first met john mccain when he became the navys liaison to the united states senate when i was republican leader
7315041 he traveled abroad with me on many occasions and i had the opportunity to observe first hand his ability to relate with foreign leaders i have a high regard respect and confidence in his unique ability to lead our country as our next president
7315042 the volunteer state is uniting behind john mccain because he has the judgment integrity and experience to lead
7315043 former senator baker and i have been friends and colleagues for many years his guidance and leadership will be a tremendous asset to my campaign
7315044 wir hatten in der zweiten halbzeit viel zu gute chancen als dass ich mit einem punkt zufrieden sein k nnte
7315045 es ist immer rgerlich wenn man 2 0 f hrt und dann noch unentschieden spielt aber das 1 2 ist einfach zu schnell gefallen
7315046 unsere erste halbzeit war schlecht aber am ende noch einen punkt zu holen ist sehr gut f r uns
7315047 herr massa solch ein rennen ist die beste antwort auf den verpassten sieg von budapest oder
7315048 pole position sieg und schnellste runde ich denke wir haben einen perfekten job gemacht ich bin sehr gl cklich besonders nach dem desaster von ungarn aber wir m ssen weiter hart arbeiten denn wir hatten an kimis auto wieder ein problem es liegen noch viele wichtige rennen vor uns
7315049 mein start war gro artig ich konnte vorne bleiben und hatte gesehen dass es hinter mir einen kleinen kampf gab gewonnen haben wir das rennen dann aber im zweiten abschnitt da ist das auto von runde zu runde immer schneller geworden im dritten abschnitt konnte ich das rennen dann ruhig nach hause fahren
7315050 eine kleine schrecksekunde gab es dann aber doch noch als es bei ihrem zweiten boxenstopp beinahe eine kollision mit adrian sutil gab wie haben sie diese situation erlebt
7315051 das war nicht sehr clever von ihm er muss mich eigentlich vorbei lassen es war bl d mit ihm k mpfen zu m ssen zumal die mauer pl tzlich sehr nah kam ich habe ihn dann fahren lassen zum gl ck hatte ich gen gend vorsprung
7315052 sie sind jetzt zweiter in der wm der r ckstand auf lewis hamilton betr gt sechs punkte wie sehen sie die situation im titelrennen
7315053 wie gesagt wir m ssen weiter hart arbeiten um unsere zuverl ssigkeit zu verbessern wir haben bis zum n chsten rennen zwei wochen zeit aber ich bin sicher alle im team sind hundertprozentig konzentriert um die probleme zu l sen
7315054 when did they conspire to no longer take an afternoon nap
7315055 you saw one purchase today kompany that cost a significant amount of money and well be back in the market trying to sign good players
7315056 i just loved it i enjoyed it 100 lots of duels lots of energy
7315057 ive got to be honest i signed two days ago trained once and today i played and didnt know their names
7315058 during the game i learned their names learned how everyone plays
7315059 it was a lot of fun i wanted to play an intelligent game and try to do my best for the team
7315060 i loved it in midfield but a job had to be done in defence
7315061 thats why the trainer manager mark hughes took me because he can count on me in different positions
7315062 vincent kompany was excellent stephen ireland came in and had a real effect
7315063 there were a lot of positives today daniel sturridge got on the scoresheet which we wanted him to do

7315073 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7315074 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7315075 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7315076 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7315077 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7315078 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7315079 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7315080 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7315081 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
7315082 tremendous groundbreaking figure everyone admires her greatly he is going to need her in the senate
7315083 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7315084 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old
7315085 the convention will give us an opportunity to reach out to those people hillary is going to be 100 percent for him
7315086 now three years later our country is still mired in the middle east were talking about more war more cold war and russia and georgia and invading iran and pakistan
7315087 its a shame that this building is apparently going to be torn down
7315088 but im happy there arent all these people making a pilgrimage to my backdoor
7315089 weve seen that with almost every other time she has made an appearance so i wouldnt be surprised if people started coming around here
7315090 chris can have all the people he wants on his back deck but i dont really want people trampling on my garden
7315091 but i do pray everyday that im going to get home safely from work

7315097 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7315098 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7315099 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7315100 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7315101 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7315102 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7315103 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7315104 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7315105 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7315106 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7315107 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7315108 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7315109 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7315110 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7315111 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7315112 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7315113 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7315114 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7315115 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7315116 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7315117 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7315118 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7315119 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7315120 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7315121 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7315122 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7315123 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7315124 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7315125 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7315126 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7315127 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7315128 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7315129 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7315130 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7315131 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7315132 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7315133 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7315134 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7315135 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7315136 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7315137 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7315138 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7315139 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7315140 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7315141 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7315142 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7315143 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7315144 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7315145 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7315146 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7315147 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7315148 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7315149 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7315150 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7315151 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7315152 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7315153 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7315154 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7315155 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7315156 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7315157 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7315158 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7315159 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7315160 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7315161 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7315162 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7315163 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7315164 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7315165 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7315166 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7315167 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7315168 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7315169 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7315170 pain is temporary it may last a minute or an hour or a day or a year but eventually it will subside and something else will take its place if i quit however it lasts forever
7315171 why are you releasing these bloody georgians if they dont release my husband who is held hostage there
7315172 i know that it is very difficult for people in this village to accept that those two prisoners have been released
7315173 i respect their reactions but i am convinced that this is a way to secure that those people missing from this village come back as soon as possible
7315174 are you mad its better to die than live with them
7315175 my grandparents told me that in the 1920s they were already killing us so what we see now is already a third wave of their terror against the ossetians

7315210 senator biden has unparalleled foreign policy experience we the obama campaign hired him for his judgment to lead this country if something happens to barack obama and the judgment and the advice that he will give to the next president of the united states and we think we have a fabulous pick we have got someone who has not forgotten where they are from and someone who can help rebuild this country
7315211 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength it is quite clear that the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton she had 50 percent of the democratic vote in the primaries obama had 50 percent of the democratic vote
7315212 the son of a single mother working his way up and then going back to work in communities that were felled by steel plant closings we are going to tell that story but we are also going to tell the story about what has happened to the country under the policies we have seen under the broken politics of washington we are not going to shy away from making a contrast

7315215 jangan begitu saja menerima tawaran parpol partai politik red karena menjadi politisi adalah suatu keahlian dan bakat sehingga tidak otomatis orang yang terkenal atau menjadi public figur termasuk artis menjadi jaminan mampu mengemban tugas sebagai wakil rakyat di lembaga legislatif

7315217 seperti nurul arifin dan rieke diah pitaloka keduanya memiliki pengalaman dan kemampuan yang sudah teruji di partai politik sehingga layak jika menjadi anggota legislatif

7315230 there is an adage that the best sermons are not preached they are lived if you look at the life of senator mccain you see a life of courage of dedication of duty of honor of character of strength of patriotism in a measure that is epic
7315231 on the question of iraq john mccain has had the guts to stand out on his own arguing for what he thought was right and it turned out that he was right about the surge working to improve conditions in iraq
7315232 but i dont waaant to eat tomatoes i want chocolate
7315233 i have no resentment against arabs who come to kurdistan as workers or tourists
7315234 we want kurdistan to be the touristic destination for arabs who will pump money into our economy
7315235 all my bad impressions about the kurds have been wiped out
7315236 kurdistan is part of iraq and we encourage iraqis living in the south and center to visit the kurdish region
7315237 we have very tight security we dont want suleimaniah to be like fallujah

7315239 theres a candidate in this presidential race who remains a mystery hazy undefined so full of contradictions that voters may see electing him as an enormous risk im referring to the cipher known as john mccain
7315240 dont pay attention to what mccain says because he doesnt speak officially for his own campaign
7315241 theres a lot of hillary clinton folks that are very upset the way the primary ended and were working with them right now and were getting a lot of support out of hillary clinton supporters and i think that the choice that barack made for joe biden was a nail on the coffin for some of them

7315263 in kazakhstan the prospect of kashagan coming online created new pressure russia meanwhile kept finding ways to hamper construction of the tengiz pipeline even though the consortium trying to build it had been realigned to be more russian friendly determined that moscow not be allowed to cripple the companys operations at the big oil field chevron responded with an elaborate end around scheme it shipped most of its tengiz production about two hundred thousand barrels a day by rail through russia and finland and some smaller volumes by barge to baku and then overland to the georgian port of poti on the black sea though these routes were long and costly to maintain chevron was able to continue exporting its crude it turned a small profit though nowhere close to the sums it could earn if russia halted its interference with the dedicated tengiz pipeline conditions seemed ripe for the grand solution that had been talked about for years a big new caspian export pipeline able to move eight hundred thousand or more barrels of oil daily free of harassment by the russians or anyone else washington liked the idea for several reasons the nascent caspian states could reap lasting economic benefits and political allegiances from such a project making them better able to resist russia should it attempt to march into central asia and the caucasus one day the pipeline could be routed so as to skirt not only russia but also iran whose policies the american government abhorred america and its allies could collect a huge energy dividend assuming that most or all of the pipelines oil were funneled to the west finally the clinton administration thought that the pipeline could be the catalyst to reorder historic north south trade routes in the region an outcome that would favor the west and disfavor russia central asia and the caucasus traditionally shipped raw material like oil natural gas and cotton north to russia which sent back finished products in return washington imagined that the pipeline and its related network of barges highways and railroads could redirect trade along east west routes with turkey playing the role that had once belonged to russia critics called the scheme grandiose but the united states took every opportunity to tout what it called its east west corridor two states in the region azerbaijan and georgia early on embraced the idea of being strung together like pearls along a great oil pipeline tied to washington affording them protection from their enemies now that the united states was behind it they liked it even more turkey did too believing that participation in such a project could renew its historical influence over the region though less fervent kazakhstan and turkmenistan also showed interest so it was that the american government breathed new life into the long incubating proposal for a 1 081 mile long pipeline from baku to export terminals at the turkish mediterranean port of ceyhan it would be the longest pipeline in the world and it would be built entirely on territory friendly to america azerbaijan would become the energy transportation hub for the entire caspian basin exporting some eight hundred thousand barrels a day by 2007 and more in later years that at least was the vision while the region itself stood to gain the most the united states became the ideas loudest promoter washington cloaked its strategy with a slogan on bumper stickers that promised a veritable blossoming of pipelines across the caspian happiness is multiple pipelines but its real aim was clear finally to put an end to moscows bullying of the region and create a pro western swath of self sufficient nations

7315268 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7315269 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7315270 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7315271 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7315272 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
7315273 tremendous groundbreaking figure everyone admires her greatly he is going to need her in the senate

7315280 there was no olympic village we the cycling team lived in a private house and my mother came down and she was the cook preparing all the food for us we had spam fritters and toad in the hole sausages in batter pudding

7315283 the athletes were never expected to carry the water for the activists it is a matter of individual conscience
7315284 ultimately it is more of an indictment of the atmosphere of intimidation and censorship imposed by the chinese government not to mention the confusing messages
7315285 id suspect a major reason for this is that olympic athletes see the games as a once in lifetime opportunity to shine in their sport stand out and possibly cash in
7315286 its a moment that theyve been training and preparing for all their lives and to risk tarnishing all their hard work with a protest or political statement just isnt worth it

7315290 the athletes were never expected to carry the water for the activists it is a matter of individual conscience

7315293 its a moment that theyve been training and preparing for all their lives and to risk tarnishing all their hard work with a protest or political statement just isnt worth it
7315294 it made me look at the third game differently than i have in the past
7315295 in the past i always wanted the starters to come out in the third quarter thats not the case this time
7315296 now it could happen with a few guys but thats not the whole purpose of the third game this time
7315297 i like our guys having that feeling of coming out of the locker room at halftime we played some awfully good football last year at the start of the second half in all three phases and wed like to continue that
7315298 theyre a very good defensive team so thats good its a gauge as to where our players are
7315299 im used to playing in front of big crowds on big stages basically what i want to do is play hard and be disciplined and execute our gameplan i think the teams ready its going to be a great opportunity for us to go out and show what we can do on a big stage
7315300 the pressure is to go out and win thats the pressure
7315301 im going to play within the system and play within the gameplan and try to make plays when the opportunities present themselves
7315302 is when you step into something youre not prepared for
7315303 were playing in a big environment which will not affect him
7315304 were playing against a talented team which will not affect him but he has not seen them play in these schemes
7315305 he had to make a lot of adjustments against tennessee too
7315306 he has such an aggressive approach to the game itself hes a guy that catches up with whats going on pretty dang quit
7315307 the future is about having a platform in the cloud
7315308 over the next decade you are going to see an incredible transformation in my opinion
7315309 it doesnt really make sense for most companies to have their own data centers just as it doesnt make sense for most companies to produce their own electric power
7315310 if you store a gigabyte of data for a month well send you a bill for 15 cents
7315311 to me cloud computing conjures up the image of something being very fluid and being very flexible
7315312 the benefits of the cloud are not only time to market but also pay as you go type of model
7315313 history shows us that the most disruptive and market changing technologies are ones that enable a broad class of people to do what previously only an elite class could do
7315314 i think it is a very very significant transformation the simplest way that i would explain it to my neighbor who isnt in the industry is that you know theres a computer on the desktop theres that computer in the data center you know that you walk by in your company but theres a new computer that is available up in the cloud and it is going to be transformational in terms of how people write and build solutions once they can assume that they can leverage that resource up there
7315315 salesforce com has done more than anybody just because of their willingness to go after the market
7315316 the big difference is that cloud computing is a much simpler approach that is easier for people to get from idea to application in a shorter period of time
7315317 the complexity is removed theres no need to think about software and versions things dont break as often the whole goal of cloud computing is to make business applications as easy as buying a book on amazon com
7315318 one of the big trends in cloud computing is not to make any one server super robust or super redundant but to handle redundancy through software
7315319 if a single server goes down or a rack or a whole data center goes down another one picks up
7315320 how much of your information do you really want hosted off site
7315321 thats a thorny little question that has to be addressed in order for cloud computing to work your data has to be stored off of your premises
7315322 as the industry solves both of those reliability and security i think were going to see massive massive scale out in the cloud
7315323 even if its a wild success today its going to blow your mind in the next two to three years
7315324 its really affected the tone and tenor of the site
7315325 the problem is that the relationship in identity between an avatar and the real person behind it is quite tenuous
7315326 no specific members are appointed but leaders in the community emerge
7315327 i think making someone wear something of a scarlet letter is a good way of doing things
7315328 this is such a nascent area when it comes to the law
7315329 if a certain world allows you to be a thief is it a crime or just an aspect of the game should real world law apply

7315333 that was a perfect day it was fun but tough and hot out there its a nice race track too
7315334 i think we should be very happy with this result i made no mistakes none all weekend and we maximised our performance
7315335 i think the whole team can be very proud of what we have achieved and hopefully in the next races we can finish in the top 10 again

7315337 in addition the authors model showed how changed ocean conditions may have been responsible for the release of co2 from the ocean into the atmosphere also accelerating the warming
7315338 the outgassing of this significant greenhouse gas co2 then contributed to warming globally
7315339 that warmed things up locally and shrank the sea ice back toward antarctica uncapping the southern ocean and freeing much of its carbon dioxide to begin warming the whole world
7315340 orbitally driven insolation changes in the southern hemisphere combined with a rise in atmospheric pco2 were sufficient to jump start the deglacial warming around antarctica without direct northern hemispheric triggers
7315341 there is no compelling reason to believe that the deglacial increase in the airs co2 content had anything at all to do with any of the warming that led to the ultimate development of the current interglacial
7315342 the website took the authors conclusion and then extrapolated their own conclusion from there that was wrong i disagree that we should be looking for bad motives or financial contributions to explain their actions
7315343 it would be easy for people to start speculating about natures motives
7315344 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever

7315359 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

7315378 dont think in terms of chapters or the word count just write in scenes let the scenes pile up and your story will come together
7315379 it makes sense that people like stephenson and myhrvold are drawn to the long nows cosmically improbable but cerebrally galvanizing effort
7315380 its an insanely ambitious project it is a total folly

7315390 during the telephone conversation between the russian and french presidents there was no discussion about replacing russian peacekeeping troops by an osce mission in the buffer zone
7315391 it has been a long journey since our decision in july 2001 to bring the olympic games to china but there can now be no doubt that we made the right choice
7315392 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world and i believe this is something that will have positive effects for the long term
7315393 we are first and foremost an organization devoted to sport but it is sport with a purpose
7315394 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7315395 others will become apparent with time the legacy of these games for china is ultimately up to the chinese people
7315396 being named a defendant is a little over the top
7315397 we are purely figureheads in this money wiring case things were done in our name but we are not clear on everything else pertaining to the investigation
7315398 we will go back to taiwan and cooperate with the investigation
7315399 i didnt know about having been used as a figurehead until i arrived in the us and heard about it from the media
7315400 being named a defendant is a little over the top
7315401 i was at the student orientation activity for international students on aug 11 where i received my student id and paid my tuition the university said i did not have a student id this is inaccurate because i do
7315402 i phoned the school to discuss what to do next but they told me that if i wanted to attend school i would have to reapply next year
7315403 the school had a drastic change in attitude we felt that something was weird we were quite surprised
7315404 capunay came to taiwan in late july and left in early august
7315405 it is too early to say who will represent ma as the summit is scheduled for late november
7315406 the specialized agency of the un that we are aiming for is the wha
7315407 aside from that the executive branch and the legislative branch of the us japan the eu and our allies all support observer status for taiwan in the wha
7315408 i felt that chinas goodwill exists we have the tacit understanding that both sides would reject establishing diplomatic ties with each others allies
7315409 to be inactive in wooing away the other sides allies is the principle the diplomatic truce plan is based on along with the goodwill both sides of the strait show to each other
7315410 when china begins to force our allies to ditch taiwan we will ask for negotiations and will also take action if it turns out that we cant strike a deal
7315411 some people might be unhappy about the un proposal for not bidding for a un seat but it is a gesture of goodwill for taiwan to talk to china and taiwan has nothing to lose
7315412 china has changed its attitude in dealing with cross strait affairs but i havent seen any changes on the diplomatic front
7315413 the ongoing olympic games might also be a reason that beijing has chosen to take a rather soft approach towards the taiwan issue
7315414 no matter how other countries consider the un proposal the key point is whether china opposes taiwans participation in the uns affiliated agencies given that they all require statehood as a prerequisite to membership

7315418 after we open direct air and sea links kinmen and xiamen will be doors of reconciliation doors of peace and doors of cooperation across the taiwan strait
7315419 we should try our best to turn kinmen from a cross strait killing field into a peace square in the 21st century
7315420 the two sides of the taiwan strait have wasted the past half century because of continuous confrontation can we afford to waste more time and not take the opportunity to push for peaceful cross strait relations
7315421 the visa proposal is tantamount to opening the country up to china

7315423 we received a letter from the office of us attorney for the southern district of new york michael j gracia late friday in which he acknowledged of having in custody aafia siddiquis eldest son ahmed who will turn 12 years old in november
7315424 the disclosure that ahmed is in us custody is a great development
7315425 i have a feeling that dr afia may be repatriated to pakistan very soon possibly before sept 3 or soon afterwards
7315426 this might be a wishful thinking but at least this hope is what is keeping our whole family on our feet
7315427 four years will be disastrous for the economy the political system the judiciary
7315428 no 1 you have a situation where the election was stolen from you no 2 there is no direction no leadership can you imagine with this leadership this policy this crime rate this economy can the country manage and survive for four years
7315429 my point is we will lose a lot if we wait for four years
7315430 we have made very clear to the un envoy that the mission should not discuss the upcoming 2010 elections as the nld does not recognize the military backed constitution
7315431 the un envoy was wasting his time on matters that he was not supposed to deal with
7315432 we do not want a civilian president with the same powers that musharraf had mainly the power to dissolve parliament
7315433 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday
7315434 abuses not only increased but china has also exported abuses by supporting authoritarian regimes in myanmar sudan and zimbabwe
7315435 before the games china talked about improving human rights but they have killed many dissidents in china and tibet and tried to cover things up by curbing press freedoms
7315436 tens of thousands of people in myanmar were slaughtered by the military junta and myanmars democracy movement leader aung san su kyi has been under house arrest for 12 years
7315437 the military junta doesnt care about international pressure because china has their back
7315438 its true that mcdonalds has long been an olympic partner but theyre spending more money than ever in beijing because they only see a market of 1 billion potential customers but not people being killed
7315439 mcdonalds does not see the 200 000 people who have died in ethnic cleansing in darfur china supported the sudanese government and provided them with weapons in exchange for oil
7315440 ma told us that he would consider boycotting the games if repression in tibet didnt stop before the olympics but now we know who he really is
7315441 the ccs technique is not a problem the question is whether the technique will be of economic benefit to us
7315442 foreign petroleum companies can profit from developing the ccs technique because when greenhouse gases are pumped into depleted oil wells deposits of oil at the bottom of the well can be extracted

7315444 we have also called in the army to assist the police in enforcing law and order
7315445 fighting intensified overnight with battles raging near the towns of datu saudi ampatuan and datu piang all in maguindanao province
7315446 we have done our best to embrace peace but the milf started the hostilities by pillaging villages and murdering innocent civilians in mindanao
7315447 now we are implementing the full force of the law and we will arrest those responsible for the traitorous attacks against civilians
7315448 this is a grim scenario and i dont even want to think about it but if the peace talks collapse then there will be war again in mindanao
7315449 the voice of reason is dwarfed by the voice of hatred and prejudice
7315450 the peace talks are slowly breaking apart and if this continues may god help us all
7315451 i was in the best shape of my career i could have gone 20 rounds what won me the fight was my conditioning
7315452 hes a hard nosed guy every round we broke him down he was hurt three or four times i also give him credit for he is as tough as nails
7315453 ricky hatton is pretty basic and the only reason hes had success in my opinion is because hes been allowed to get away with everything hes done and more than half of the things he does are based on illegal tactics and people just let it slide
7315454 i have to make this point because im watching miguel cotto antonio margarito and the whole fight is basically inside fighting there are no breaks but theres no holding any time theres actually a clinch the referee breaks them in an instant and theres no complaints from anyone in either camp but whenever theres a ricky hatton fight theres always a question of whos going to allow inside fighting because hes the only one whos holding when theres inside fighting cotto margarito was an inside fight that everyone enjoyed and whenever there was a clinch the referee broke it right away and there was no complaining
7315455 here is a man who is showing that blindness is not the end of the world
7315456 he had a tendency to stick his chin out which is not a good tendency when youre fighting punchers
7315457 he had terrific boxing skills he could box with anybody but he had some problems with punchers he had that little flaw in his technique
7315458 if you didnt fight that guy you might have gone farther rhoshii was one of those fighters who was just below world championship caliber
7315459 the victim and suspect get into an argument and some words are exchanged and the suspect decides to come back and kill rhoshii wells
7315460 if it wasnt rhoshii wells it would have been somebody else

7315464 oscar is no longer a fighter hes a business man and if you ask me hes a smart business man oscar will not fight me because he knows ill retire him and hes not ready to stop deceiving the public
7315465 margarito told me that what oscar needs to do is take off the fishnets that he still wears underneath his clothes step up and become a man by accepting the fight
7315466 i always made oscar bleed when we sparred i would hurt oscar so much that he would have his trainer dismiss me from his training camp oscar wanted to hit but he would get upset when i would hit back
7315467 oscar is no longer a fighter hes a business man and if you ask me hes a smart business man oscar will not fight me because he knows ill retire him and hes not ready to stop deceiving the public
7315468 margarito told me that what oscar needs to do is take off the fishnets that he still wears underneath his clothes step up and become a man by accepting the fight
7315469 i always made oscar bleed when we sparred i would hurt oscar so much that he would have his trainer dismiss me from his training camp oscar wanted to hit but he would get upset when i would hit back
7315470 if they dont do something significant they are going to embarrass themselves
7315471 the foreboding economic forecasts are going to make it clear that i was right
7315472 that would be far more devastating than insulting them my message banging them over the head will be worse than any tv ad
7315473 they are responding they know that this is real and their response is going to win them huge praise from the same public so thats the way you can work around being out financed
7315474 in the end even if the polls had been down i think this is the right thing to do im staking my own personal reputation and basically my career on it
7315475 ask god to forgive him because neither me or my family will
7315476 i feel this is a true injustice to me and my family
7315477 i should have listened to them when they said dont
7315478 killed more than 130 apostates wounded more than 100 and destroyed three barracks and several vehicles
7315479 the fascist direction this country has taken should be brought to a halt and it can only be done by conscious activism by people living in this country saying we will no longer go along with the things done by the bush administration
7315480 that was a last minute change and it does present a challenge in that it came about at the last minute
7315481 its really just a matter of relying on the partnerships that were already in place using the same resources to put the event together on somewhat short notice for invesco field
7315482 the future of the next few days is unwritten but the level to which the secret service the federal government and the city of denver have already gone to interfere with the free speech rights of protesters is unprecedented
7315483 it will not look like a police state or a war zone but there will certainly be an increased presence that is just a hallmark of the necessary security
7315484 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7315485 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
7315486 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7315487 when they were leaving the scene it was under the understanding that perhaps he hadnt shown the best judgment there were a number of people that took offense to the child being naked in the group and subjected to peoples scrutiny
7315488 it sounds like its been a good lesson all around
7315489 the pressure is going to be how do we get this war right
7315490 in the case of iraq the americans had a big strategic rethink about how they were handling it
7315491 that kind of rethink is whats going to have to take place with afghanistan
7315492 now that the situation is changing in iraq they are heading to a new front which is the one in afghanistan
7315493 will travel to israel and the palestinian territories on aug 24
7315494 ongoing efforts to create positive and lasting peace in the region and progress towards the shared goal of a peace agreement in 2008
7315495 there is some kind of expectation of doing something before the end of the year
7315496 i believe that the timeline is important but what is more important is the content and the nature of the understanding that we can reach with the palestinians
7315497 this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence
7315498 israeli establishment went bankrupt having no answer to the solid and strong information on the al aqsa institutions activities in regards to the damage caused to the holy sites in general and to the al aqsa mosque in particular

7315511 when it gets a little boring i might pull it out
7315512 we think this is the way the future is going to work
7315513 we would have probably gone ahead of this maybe just getting a thousand iphones and giving them out
7315514 my colleagues and i are studying something called augmented reality
7315515 you can imagine similar kinds of interactive activities along historical lines
7315516 its important that we do research so that we know how well something like this works
7315517 im not someone whos anti technology but im always worried that technology becomes an end in and of itself and it replaces teaching or it replaces analysis
7315518 i would ban that too if i knew the students were using it in class
7315519 what we want to encourage in these students is active intellectual experience in which they develop the wide range of complex reasoning abilities required of the good lawyers
7315520 we had assumed that the biggest focus of these devices would be consuming the content
7315521 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7315522 i hope the atmosphere on the mall and across the entire uk will be electric
7315523 i look forward to coming back here and swimming four years from now
7315524 i am looking forward to trying some new events some events ive never really had the opportunity to swim since my schedule is always so crowded phelps said adding hes never competed in a backstroke event at a major international meet or in the 100m freestyle
7315525 i have hoped for a return for a while and yesterday i began to believe that this deal could end well for me it is as if ive won the champions league
7315526 there were some complications but now that everything is resolved i am really happy
7315527 we have succeeded in bringing back home the player who scored the most goals with our jersey in the last 50 years
7315528 andriy made a mistake to leave and i think that over the last two years he has realized that this is his home
7315529 now he has made his financial sacrifices but at this point the only thing that matters is that hes back with us
7315530 chelsea fc have agreed terms for andriy shevchenko to return to ac milan details of the agreement will remain confidential the move is subject to a successful medical
7315531 lady luck shone on me the two years i was fighting for the title 2005 and 2006 but now im having a lot of ill fortune
7315532 they are well coached theyve got good athletes and they beat us
7315533 considering the circumstances the boks were in they were quite desperate after last week this is a significant win
7315534 weve had a tough time of it in the last few years not winning here since 2000 and the fact its always difficult so were very satisfied
7315535 while ive been in beijing what ive been eating most is pizza and hamburgers
7315536 i love western food so ive had a lot of it chinese food tends to be so greasy so its better for me to eat western food
7315537 i shot two shots and they were in his favor so he was getting points from my work
7315538 the icc board today agreed unanimously to postpone the icc champions trophy until october 2009
7315539 pakistan will retain the right to host the tournament but it was agreed that if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the icc board would have the right to decide about the tournaments location
7315540 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making
7315541 however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete in the icc champions trophy had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7315542 i think ive been striking it much much better and i think with a little more confidence
7315543 you know that the trees are not 99 percent air for example which you think when youre young and you do get bad lies which you never do when youre younger it seems like but yeah im enjoying this
7315544 its not easy to win the gold medal weve worked very hard
7315545 its the most glorious day for rhythmic gymnastics in china
7315546 i knew the russian and belarussian teams are at a higher level but we have our style
7315547 we used beijing opera music which creates a nice atmosphere for the spectators they understand our background
7315548 i really really feel upset we didnt live up to our expectations
7315549 we heard allegations in the media about the ages and we took that very seriously and we asked the international federation to organize an inquiry themselves
7315550 the eligibility of the athletes is the responsibility of the federation not the ioc but we considered it to be a very serious issue the international federation requested all documents like family books and entries of schools and things like that and these have been received at first sight everything seems ok however the fig wants to study them thoroughly because they are in chinese and then they will report to the ioc as soon as possible
7315551 i want to solemnly state here that the age of all these athletes that have been questioned conforms with olympic rules for these events
7315552 last year at the cities games he was transferred from one competing delegation to another and in the process of registration there was some discrepancies in the age of athletes
7315553 therefore that mistake led to a series of other misunderstandings afterward
7315554 i dont want to talk about this subject any more because those who know me they know that im 16
7315555 how can i do more explain more no matter what people say im still 16
7315556 a gold medal in the olympics is a huge victory for us
7315557 i think when that kind of thing happens the guys got a good taste of whats important in life
7315558 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners
7315559 i had to push the pace because my body gets tired when i slow down
7315560 in the last 10km it was unbelievable what the africans were able to do under these conditions
7315561 but i felt like i got stronger as the game wore on i was able to maintain myself
7315562 it feels good to play well when you know you have to
7315563 i cant have any say in the wild cards and its up to nick to pick who he sees is best going to help the team but i needed to play well to make him look at me
7315564 now ill try to do that again next week at gleneagles
7315565 it was all down to nerves but i again managed to dig deep i want that ryder cup place so badly
7315566 i came over here to do a job and didnt do it so ill have to do it next week
7315567 i think everybody comes into the year looking at that top four or five i think any teams realistic goal is that and we still give ourselves a chance to finish in that area
7315568 the roosters are only two points ahead of us and we play them weve got a better for and against so we can definitely go past them it just depends on us winning weve got to beat parramatta then beat the roosters and obviously we need a result to go our way but the good thing is we can put ourselves in the position if we keep winning
7315569 weve just got to keep winning and that will look after itself but it would be nice if we could
7315570 it might come down to the roosters game in that last round but firstly weve got parramatta next week and theyre fighting for their season as well so weve got two more desperate teams wanting to win
7315571 gaz has played fullback in attack at some stages this year but he hasnt actually defended there so to size up wade mckinnon there was a great effort and for matty prior who is a front rower to get across to where he got to thats what gets you into a position to win
7315572 its disappointing but we havent got time to dwell on it because theres no time for slip ups now
7315573 weve got to get back and prepare for penrith in what is now i guess a do or die game
7315574 we had a couple of really good chances early in the second half where we just couldnt finish them off
7315575 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on the best type of spit for the task at hand
7315576 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7315577 for the first time as i dived to gather the ball at square leg i landed on my side and a shower of murray mints spewed out of my trouser pocket all over the grass right in front of the umpire
7315578 fortunately neither he nor the two batsmen seemed to take much notice as i scrambled around on all fours trying desperately to gather in the sweets before they started asking awkward questions
7315579 he realised the player in charge of polishing and keeping the ball clean was his top order batsman asif din and what he did to keep his concentration levels up was chewing extra strong mints
7315580 it took a while for word to get around the circuit but once it did the sales of sweets near the county grounds of england went through the roof
7315581 i tried asifs confection of choice but couldnt get on with them too dry so i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat
7315582 well maybe it will be a bit of a strain on him but hell manage
7315583 wait he wont be the only person using the wiki is it the right thing for the people who will hopefully come visiting
7315584 i just wanted to win he knew he was six points down and bit me he was tough horrible and strong throughout
7315585 it was the sort of accident cyclists have in every town every day
7315586 we need to encourage kids to ride by having meaningful bike lanes
7315587 that would bring health spin offs and reduce pollution you might get decent athletes too
7315588 i was keeping goods there and they didnt let me bring them out i lost about us 850 000 and they even used 7 000 boxes of cheese for protection on the roof
7315589 the work has improved the markets have opened iraqi traders are dealing with other companies directly
7315590 i left the country because of the violence but now that it is more secure i will return to live in baghdad at the end of this month
7315591 it is the first time in six conferences we are talking about actual projects before we were always discussing terrorism and sectarianism
7315592 we are at the beginning we would like to establish the good basics to start and actually there are some plans started but there are still few
7315593 we have very big strategic plans in iraq which include electricity and oil and the refineries and also other factories which will bring good benefits to iraq
7315594 this very important discovery not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
7315595 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7315596 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7315597 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7315598 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7315599 i know how to enter the us open and what it takes to win thats a huge advantage i have
7315600 i come here as the defending champion so i always have great feelings about this place
7315601 i believe it is an advantage if you know how to win a us open
7315602 rafa has never been beyond the fourth round so that is definitely the advantage that i carry
7315603 for five years i was expected to win every tournament
7315604 so now it changes a little bit rafa will feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7315605 maybe it is nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me it should be interesting
7315606 i dont know about that i am going to concentrate on what i can really control and that is my section of the draw trying to control all the players we will see how it goes
7315607 i am working very hard and some of the things dont happen overnight
7315608 you cant get your endurance and your strength back in a few days i will keep working hard and we will see what happens
7315609 believe it or not tennis is the most popular sport in serbia
7315610 that was never the case before we didnt have a tradition of producing great tennis players
7315611 fabio is meant to lead but the only place weve gone so far is round in circles
7315612 it means picking vibrant wide players rather than starting with david beckham when he cant get forward as he used to it means banging steven gerrard and frank lampards heads together and getting them to play as a unit because they can
7315613 prospects for a slowing economy and a less concerned inflationary pressure may lead to the central bank decelerating monetary tightening
7315614 with growth momentum in domestic demand remaining weak we maintain our view that the central bank will most likely hike again next month by another 0 125 percentage points and that should be its last increase this year
7315615 the slowdown will likely be shallow in terms of speed but will likely linger until 2009 the chances of a pause in hiking the rate are increasing
7315616 peaking of asias inflation will probably be at least one month earlier
7315617 now it looks like inflation will most likely peak in july or august especially in south korea taiwan india indonesia malaysia and thailand
7315618 we judge the rate hiking cycle to be virtually over and expect several central banks to be cutting next year
7315619 it was clearly an important item of treasure it is a gold ring possibly containing a rare black diamond
7315620 it is a beautiful early medieval inscribed finger ring that would have been owned by a very wealthy person in the church or possible even royalty
7315621 common people in that era were not even allowed to own gold so it must have been owned by a powerful person
7315622 it is boldly inscribed with lettering that certainly looks very early medieval to my untrained eye
7315623 i dont know yet what the letters spell out but if they indicate a royal owner it might be worth tens of thousand of pounds
7315624 i have found all sorts of stuff including roman and saxon broaches and coins but nothing that has been declared treasure trove before i still dont know if its of any great value
7315625 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
7315626 much respect to spain but the us is back on top again
7315627 im proud of our guys we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7315628 i was a little bit nervous in the beginning of the third set i got my rhythm back i was really pumped up when i had to be really enjoyed the moment in the end
7315629 nine times losing ive got a lot of runner up trophies in my office in my house these are the ones i need to get
7315630 i really accomplished a lot these last couple of weeks
7315631 here its the tournament before the us open and its a really big tournament i have beaten some really great players
7315632 i was playing her game in the first set i had to make her play my game make her do the things i wanted her to do i tried to change and it worked
7315633 it finished quite late went three sets and i didnt really sleep well

7315640 i wish wed scored more goals because we had plenty of chances
7315641 but if we play like this and allow so few chances theres not much to complain about
7315642 mai bine nu mai calific m deloc echipa la olimpiad
7315643 je mange du houmous maison mais je mange aussi de la tartiflette
7315644 the main reason was the sharp rise in the price of jet fuel by 73 percent causing the companys fuel costs to rise sharply
7315645 last year we expected oil prices of at most us 110 to us 120 but the prices rapidly jumped higher by that time it was too late to raise ticket prices to catch up with the oil prices
7315646 our loss in july dropped significantly and we already saw profit showing in the first half of august
7315647 but our big challenges currently are to regain trust among our customers and business partners and to help customers understand our need to raise ticket prices
7315648 cutting costs is just a dream especially when global oil prices keep rising steeply in practice it is too difficult to catch up with rising oil prices by raising air fares or fuel surcharge fees
7315649 i have decided to raise no objections under australias foreign investment policy
7315650 this will underpin the rio share price and also create uncertainty about whether or not bhp will get its deal over the line
7315651 even if chinalco doesnt increase its stake it shows they have the capacity to block the deal
7315652 while australia welcomes foreign investment in our economy we will carefully examine national interest issues where these arise in relation to foreign sovereign ownership
7315653 it could do a soft deal with bhp and vote for the merger in return for securing the assets
7315654 shared opinions for the needs for policy cooperation to effectively counter global economic concerns
7315655 the two ministers agreed to closely cooperate and exchange information on the economy
7315656 they will strengthen cooperation in the environment sector and exchange views on the aging population
7315657 the central bank does not own any fannie mae or freddie mac shares
7315658 the two companies bonds still enjoy top credit ratings despite their ongoing financial woes
7315659 the us government has announced measures including acquisition to help sustain the two institutions aware of the central role they play in the nations housing sector
7315660 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7315661 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7315662 it creates a troubling perception when washington policymakers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive home foreclosures are on the line
7315663 market participants failed to soundly manage measure and disclose risks with ignorance greed or hubris playing their customary roles
7315664 the alarms of the financial sector have been overstated the real economy has slowed down but is not yet in severe difficulty
7315665 we dont use finger paint on our desks to write notes
7315666 during the latter part of 2006 i had this success with dell but other manufacturers said touch we dont know
7315667 the cost is going to have to come down substantially
7315668 i thought it would be interesting and beneficial to hakka culture at large to show that there are a ton of super cool musicians out there but theyre not interested in being famous or trying to get on stage or into the limelight theyre just on their chicken farm or wherever playing their music
7315669 i think he was doubtful and kind of humored by the idea
7315670 but nevertheless he gave me a bottle of kaoliang and signed his name on it with the date and gave it to me and said if i succeed i should bring it back and we would drink it together
7315671 i felt i could capture the essence of their music and lift it up to a new level to make people pay attention
7315672 what i hope is that the cd will attract different peoples attention in a way that will lead them back to appreciating and rediscovering taiwans traditional music for what it is without new clothes go find the stuff because its out there

7315675 some people have huge memorabilia collections said ted owen managing director of the specialist auction house the fame bureau

7315681 if you go back 12 months brand china was in tremendous difficulties with toxic toys and a number of other issues
7315682 chinas amazing haul of gold medals has mirrored its spectacular economic growth to signal to the world that china has truly arrived
7315683 from the grandeur of the opening ceremony to the self assured way chinese athletes expected to win in so many events china exceeded every expectation
7315684 companies like li ning that are looking to expand globally are going to use the olympics as a chance to do that
7315685 before the games people were anticipating a business boom in tourism benefiting hotels airlines and local restaurants
7315686 now its becoming clear that the impact wasnt all that big i dont think industries like that are likely to benefit greatly from one month of olympics and paralympics
7315687 analyzing the one off macroeconomic impact or the economics of the games is not really an issue of such great importance
7315688 the beijing olympics are another milepost in chinas transformation into an efficient market oriented and financially sophisticated economy and a more open society
7315689 sau oricum altfel doar jo 2008 sa contina n am dorit sa fac acest lucru deoarece nu vreau sa va plictisesc plus de asta nu vroiam sa vina tot felul de disperati de pe google folosind cautari de genul

7315691 i dont care what the opposition says i will do it thats me
7315692 if there is further reduction the government will announce an adjustment every 15 days based on global crude oil price
7315693 its unrealistic to expect a presidential candidate to lay out the sacrifices and they will be sacrifices needed to rescue social security
7315694 the statements of some nato representatives that the maneuvers of the alliances ships in the black sea were planned a year ago are evidence that attacks on south ossetia and abkhazia were planned earlier maybe even last year
7315695 now that the conflict with south ossetia is exhausted there are nato vessels in the black sea what for and with what aim
7315696 we will be seeking more specific information about why he was picked up and held and about his experience during his incarceration
7315697 the nice thing about hosting one of these conventions is that you can show off
7315698 we dont want some traffic jam protest or unfortunate incident to become the big story because theres too much good stuff going on here we have the infrastructure to be prepared to handle anything
7315699 the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery it did not collapse from explosives or fuel oil fires
7315700 weve had trouble getting a handle on building no 7
7315701 the specifics of the fires in wtc 7 and how they caused the building to collapse remain unknown at this time although the total diesel fuel on the premises contained massive potential energy only a low probability of occurrence
7315702 sunder proceeded to stumble through some convoluted explanation for why only fire could be responsible seeming caught off guard and uncomfortable
7315703 afghan president hamid karzai strongly condemns the unco ordinated air strike by coalition forces in shindand district of herat province which resulted in the death of at least 70 people including women and children
7315704 under the circumstances it is difficult to avoid the impression that the cia and other intelligence agencies defended themselves against the dangers of attack from the bush administration through a process of self censorship
7315705 the net impression is that the cia white paper was rewritten to conform to administration preferences if so u s intelligence a priori made itself a tool of a political effort vitiating the intelligence function and confirming the presence of a politicized process
7315706 the specific analytic failures on iraq intelligence become much less significant in such a climate especially in that they all yielded intelligence predictions of exactly the kind the bush administration wanted to hear
7315707 it is only the british not the germans or the french
7315708 they scream they sing they fall down they take their clothes off they cross dress they vomit
7315709 hay cansancio eso lo hemos evidenciado hay p rdida del sentido de lucha y por eso creemos que hay una situaci n madura para las desmovilizaciones colectivas el reto es convencerlos de que tambi n con ellos podemos pactar procesos dignos

7315716 he hated it when pictures started appearing of him with a belly and love handles

7315719 he also gave him diet advice tom has been sticking to 1 200 calories a day mostly grilled chicken and fish with lots of vegetables salads and fruit
7315720 ive noticed that most kids who excel at math dont do so well in probability

7315722 soldiers walk the streets carrying thousands of dollars to pay iraqis for doorways battered in american raids and limbs lost during firefights sheiks appeal to commanders to use larger pools of money locked away in humvees and safes at military bases for new schools health clinics water treatment plants and generators knowing that the military can bypass iraqi and u s bureaucratic hurdles
7315723 the program is intended for short term small scale urgent humanitarian relief and reconstruction but as the broader 50 billion effort to rebuild iraq with big infrastructure projects runs dry cerp is by default taking on more importance as a reconstruction program something it may not be equipped to do in a coordinated nationwide way
7315724 cerp is in fact a reconstruction program in addition to being a counterinsurgency weapon
7315725 a 33 million hotel office and retail complex at baghdad international airport
7315726 outside kirkuk in northern iraq an 8 3 million water treatment project completed in february with cerp funds took more than two years and was 1 7 million over budget and it is not far from another water treatment system that usaid paid 4 1 million to build two years ago

7315740 initially malware was created to wreak havoc and cause disruption for purposes of notoriety but over time it has evolved into a stealthy malicious threat leveraged by criminals for financial gain
7315741 as a result of this paradigm shift there are currently tens of thousands of live web sites that misuse brands and trademarks for purposes of malware distribution cyveillance stays ahead of the curve by taking an intelligence led approach to security proactively monitoring and identifying specific instances of online brand abuse

7315752 at least not that ive been made aware of well find out in next couple of days
7315753 were going to talk about it i dont know if any decisions have been made
7315754 the media should better educate the public on the consumption of healthy food and a healthy lifestyle rather than just airing advertisements
7315755 but i am afraid the media will make it too technical and the public will not understand i hope the media can work with the health ministry to come up with short statements on how many spoons of sugar a normal body needs daily
7315756 as we are aware the malaysian adult nutrition survey in 2003 revealed that only about 40 percent of adults consumed green vegetables on a daily basis and the television can play a good role here by encouraging the public to eat more of these stuff and tell us the benefits of doing so during the prime time news break when most of us will be having dinner
7315757 of course they must tell us how much sugar is in the teh tarik and how many glasses of teh tarik we can consume in a day without fearing the reaction from the teh tarik sellers
7315758 i congratulate the former health minister datuk seri chua soi lek for being bold enough to advice the government to stop certain advertisements deemed detrimental to the publics health if consumed too much
7315759 i would like to see more lanes created for walking in towns especially near commercial centres bus stops and schools at present there is little or no provision for such lanes covered with tree canopy to encourage people to walk to or from the bus stop offices and the schools
7315760 today we see many school children being obese or overweight as they do not walk much because their parents feel it is too dangerous for their children to walk on the roads
7315761 there are cases where the fields have been fenced up or reserved for elite groups and this saddens me
7315762 a good example will be a field in my hometown in temerloh pahang today a mini stadium is on the field and the public has no free access
7315763 seriously bec look at me like that again and i will smack you down bitch
7315764 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
7315765 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
7315766 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
7315767 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
7315768 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
7315769 seriously bec look at me like that again and i will smack you down bitch
7315770 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
7315771 ante las decenas de quejas de enfermeras que manifiestan que sus patronos no han cumplido en su totalidad con la ley 27 le estoy solicitando un informe detallado de qui n ha cumplido y qui n no

7315773 when youre putting wheat on the ground theres going to be a loss
7315774 they dont ever like to put it on the ground but when wheat is 7 8 or 10 a bushel they sure dont like to put it on the ground
7315775 were way way behind in our infrastructure investment both in the private sector and publicly
7315776 and we need to move a lot on that or we will see other countries supplant us as they get greater investment in their infrastructure
7315777 two or three dollars a ton is the difference between getting a contract or not
7315778 it was one of the most glorious evenings of the summer weatherwise we really lucked out it was a fun evening

7315780 the us and denmark together have a lot to clean up
7315781 its not even halfway done the east coast and icecap areas have thousands of abandoned barrels and the failure to clean up the thule air base is something that is very heavy in our hearts
7315782 it should be returned in the same condition as when they hunted there
7315783 there was strong pressure on the americans that they should clean up after themselves but they wouldnt budge
7315784 they said if you push us we wont give you an inch of it
7315785 they said if they were to clean up after themselves at thule then they would be met by similar demands in the philippines japan and elsewhere in the world they didnt want to set that precedent
7315786 there was a total reversion of the american position on the environment between 1991 and 2003
7315787 reflected a shared burden with our host nation for our contribution for defense of the free world
7315788 given up any claims for residual value of improvements made while there
7315789 the result of normal practices in place at the time
7315790 forbidden us to remediate overseas sites returned to host nations when not required to by an international agreement
7315791 its not as if somebody who goes to the site will be exposed to something
7315792 these chemicals arent an acute risk to environmental or human health but they can cause chronic harm
7315793 it might be better to leave them standing as long as you can and concentrate on more critical sites
7315794 a scripted and sanitized spectacle for a homogenous group of wealthy elites inside the convention hall versus a thriving organic movement of the masses outside
7315795 its to say to the whole country we are here
7315796 we plan to show that this is a crisis this is something that needs to be looked at with a little more urgency we dont have enough housing we dont have enough healthcare and its killing the people
7315797 democracy is not waiting to vote once every four years democracy is getting out in the streets
7315798 they the politicians are not gonna do it by themselves were gonna force their hand because that is the nature of democracy
7315799 especially now with a candidate who talks a lot about hope and change people talk about why do you need to protest
7315800 says zoe williams a local organizer with code pink women for peace and a spokesperson for the alliance for real democracy
7315801 i think that we need to define what hope and change are we need to decide what that means to us as a people
7315802 for people who are disenfranchised by the system some of them for the first time are being motivated into politics
7315803 we want to create a broad progressive movement that can invite these newly politicized people in and we want to create a campaign that can take that beyond the voting booth
7315804 the story obama tells about how were gonna change this world by regular people taking action
7315805 creates more space for social movement organizing in a way we havent had since the 60s i would like to see the conventions and the protests around them take full advantage of that opportunity
7315806 use both conventions to put forward a narrative that we are starting a new chapter in american history our job is to be part of that progressive wave and to pull it to the left as much as we can
7315807 because obamas running they think weve got them theyre coming out theyre gonna support obama no matter what
7315808 some of us arent so sure that its gonna make a difference
7315809 the candidacy of obama is a reflection of the publics desire for something different
7315810 we believe that despite the rhetoric obama uses genuine change will always come from the bottom up and that means countering the system as a whole
7315811 people have learned that a top down approach to things doesnt work
7315812 what we have in common is a desire to break the spell that elections have over the us left
7315813 our message is one of direct participation in democracy bypassing corrupt politicians who dont represent us but instead further corporate interests
7315814 the rnc is a very easy target because they are so visibly to blame for whats happening in this country
7315815 theres a whole lot more energy for the rnc than the dnc
7315816 i dont know what to make of shutting down the rnc
7315817 id like to see more of a consciousness raising thing i dont want the left to be perceived as crazy
7315818 we know that it is the police not protesters or activists who will have the tasers guns rubber bullets concussion grenades chemical weapons helicopters the media spin machine and millions of dollars on their side
7315819 were just hoping that the denver police dont recreate the violence that happened in chicago in 68
7315820 it provides inspiration and an example of what can be possible
7315821 but it can also prove a disservice if we just recreate 68 we will be destined to also recreate its problems
7315822 that culture of activist summit hopping im not really into that i do think it is important to show a resistance to both parties i just think that there are different ways that people go about doing that and i hope we dont lose steam over this election weve got a long way to go
7315823 is to get to work organizing where we are at our campuses workplaces and in our communities while at the same time building links with people struggling all around the world
7315824 we really need to find a way to engage the people who are excited and really do think that obamas gonna change something
7315825 we have to do a lot of popular education to say that it isnt politicians who make real change its the movements that politicians have to follow
7315826 randy scheunemann is a foreign policy adviser to senator mccain and he is on leave from orion strategies we have no further comment
7315827 hey sexy lady want to go out come on let a study show you a good time
7315828 we couldnt and we havent found any identification showing they are taliban
7315829 the coalition forces have made mistakes so many times and killed so many civilians we are asking president karzai to come here
7315830 on such a serious allegation as this one we have to look into it
7315831 were just trying to get to the bottom of this
7315832 if you see something you dont understand you have to ask why
7315833 mr campbell often admonished his students at ridgeview high school
7315834 and mickey gets cuter because walt disney makes more money that way
7315835 evolution has been the focus of a lot of debate in our state this year
7315836 if you read the newspapers everyone is arguing is it a theory is it not a theory the answer is we can observe it we can see it happen just like you can see it in mickey
7315837 i can see that theres no way i came from an ape
7315838 is this really what they want us to teach for the next 10 years
7315839 i dont think we have this great massive change over time where we go from fish to amphibians from monkeys to man
7315840 we see lizards with different shaped tails we dont see blizzards the lizard bird
7315841 we also failed to include astrology alchemy and the concept of the moon being made of green cheese
7315842 i can do this until the end of the semester and i can only assume that it will work the same way each time
7315843 bryce what is it called when natural laws are suspended what do you call it when water changes into wine
7315844 it cant tell you whats right and wrong it doesnt address ethics but it is not anti religion science and religion just ask different questions
7315845 cant test it cant prove it cant disprove it its not a question for science
7315846 but there is scientific proof that there is a god
7315847 over in turkey theres a piece of wood from noahs ark that came out of a glacier
7315848 if i could prove tomorrow that that chunk of wood is not from the ark is not even 500 years old and not even from the right kind of tree would that damage your religious faith at all
7315849 and science is not based on faith i dont expect you to believe the scientific explanation of evolution that were going to talk about over the next few weeks
7315850 i still dont have a good feeling on how well any of them are internalizing any of this
7315851 its maybe the size of a dogs jaw or a cats
7315852 i think a big reason evolutionists believe what they believe is they dont want to have to be ruled by god
7315853 thats why people stand strong with christianity because it teaches people to lead a good life and not do wrong
7315854 ill watch the discovery channel and say ooh thats interesting
7315855 but theres a difference between thinking something is interesting and believing it
7315856 homo sapiens appeared in africa 200 000 years ago based on fossil and dna evidence
7315857 the fossil evidence of hominids alleged human ancestors is extremely limited
7315858 but theirs is a longer hand because they live in trees and their arms are very long
7315859 but this is happening over millions of years with humans if im lucky i might see four generations in my lifetime
7315860 then whatever we evolved from where did it evolve from
7315861 how does our hand go from being that long to just a smaller hand
7315862 individuals with small hands will have more children while those with bigger hands will disappear
7315863 but if we came from them why are they still around
7315864 just because a new population evolves doesnt mean the old one dies out
7315865 if the environment is suitable a species can go on for a long time

7315887 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7315888 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7315889 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic

7315893 number one you take all the troops out you better have helicopters ready to take those 3 000 civilians inside the green zone where i have been seven times and shot at you better make sure you have protection for them or let them die number one
7315894 trick r treat is first and foremost an entertainment and nothing more an unpretentious light hearted but never cutesy and blackly comic movie
7315895 i specialise in a business pool which includes belfast and scotland and im proud to describe myself as a loyalist and a unionist a wide range of organisations come to us because we provide management training and marketing skills when the bnp contacted us i had no option but to work with them it was an exciting business proposal i understand the truth truck could soon be on its way to northern ireland but thats nothing to do with me
7315896 the bnp are not an illegal organisation so why shouldnt i work with them i dont think their members are involved in criminal activity i have worked in northern ireland for a long time but not for any proscribed organisations the bnp is not a proscribed organisation it would be wrong for me to pontificate about the views of the bnp and i honestly cant think of anyone i wouldnt work with
7315897 dowsons marketing plan is nothing more than a begging letter the bnp is in very serious financial trouble and this is how they think they can get money the bnp may not be illegal but they articulate views which clearly motivate people to commit very serious attacks on minorities
7315898 there is an element of inciting hatred there is no attraction in northern ireland for this type of politics and i would discourage this party from coming over here we have always had good race relations in northern ireland there may be the odd incident but that does not represent the majority of people here
7315899 provided europes athletes with yet another opportunity to show themselves at their best and they have certainly not disappointed their millions of supporters
7315900 european athletes have not only delivered excellence in competitions as testified in the individual achievements of each participating countries but they have also demonstrated that team work and fair play are key values to the sporting community of our continent and to all europeans
7315901 let us not forget that the games will be back in 2012 on the continent where they were born
7315902 all sporting friends within the eu are already looking forward to the 2012 games in london

7315904 bmx is a really good fit not only for the sport itself but also in teaching a lot of kids bike skills
7315905 a lot of those guys come from bmx thats where they started riding bikes and thats where new zealand has got huge strength
7315906 and we also have through bmx the ability to start capturing our future cyclists some may stay in the bmx others may come across to track or road and they have amazing bike skills thats why bmx is important to us
7315907 we are looking at prioritising more into track and bmx we know weve got the athletes now and coming through who can show some longevity in the sport
7315908 we want to contract those guys to win gold in london
7315909 weve got 20 year old olympians who may want to go pro we have to look at what we can invest in and what we get in return for that and that it will have a positive impact
7315910 the satisfaction is that we know we can do better i like to think weve taken the first step forward we are heading in the right direction
7315911 ive been offered several teams from different countries but i havent signed anything yet
7315912 i want to do my best and try to make it permanent
7315913 i had a few options but i chose sunderland because of the manager the club have big ambitions and really good players
7315914 if a player didnt want to play for me i know what id do id drive him myself to wherever he wants to go
7315915 ive said it before no player is bigger than any club
7315916 sometimes you have to lose to win tottenham have lost against sunderland but long term it might be best for the business
7315917 this case is part of our broad work to protect clean water
7315918 washington environmental council is the type of group id love to see in every state in the nation
7315919 kristen and i ran into each other and we did discuss a veronica movie
7315920 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
7315921 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
7315922 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
7315923 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman were going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it
7315924 das mit deinem sohn ist doch alles normal warum sollten sie dich abh ren
7315925 sie tun es offiziell vielleicht nicht aber es k nnte ja sein dass sie es probieren

7315928 the boxing team is very young i m happy with them it s true we haven t won a gold medal but i m not aware of any problems
7315929 they came here with no experience and they ve won eight medals no gold i know but nobody was expecting more than one or two medals at all for us
7315930 now we have not only eight medals but also a team with olympic experience ready to start preparing for the next olympics
7315931 ive been able to represent my country since i was 24 years old its been just awesome
7315932 life was meant to be lived and curiosity must be kept alive one must never for whatever reason turn his back on life
7315933 were wearing aprons but everybody whos here the agents the editors the faculty the fellows the other contributors knows that this person whos waiting on you is going to be a very important writer in four or five years
7315934 so for us its kind of amazing and i think for everybody its kind of amazing
7315935 its humbling we handle compost things spill theres a lot of running
7315936 these are people i would never ever ever talk to even in a social situation
7315937 but you have to go up to them and ask do you want chicken or the vegetarian option and when you start talking to them that way when youre getting them their coffee and their dessert a natural sort of conversation starts happening
7315938 i took a lot of naps and a lot of advil
7315939 its like having tiger woods help you with your putting
7315940 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7315941 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7315942 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7315943 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7315944 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7315945 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7315946 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7315947 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7315948 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should ben affleck be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us
7315949 why shouldnt he be in denver he has nothing to be ashamed of
7315950 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps
7315951 i dont think oprah hurts i think she helps a lot
7315952 they havent called but if they need me im on a plane whatever they want

7315983 a flash flood watch is in effect through monday evening for much of southeastern louisiana
7315984 we have activated our teams as a precautionary measure for the safety of the public
7315985 we are prepared to close the gates and run the pumps should the need arise
7315986 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7315987 campus drainage is usually capable of handling the kinds of rains we think fay will deliver over the next couple of days
7315988 i would say its more of a wet spell a bit of an annoyance
7315989 monday looks like it could be a wet day to start the semester
7315990 everything from making sure all the universitys generators have fuel topped off down to the most minute things there are procedures

7315993 out of the blue i decided i am going to go up there and see what he has i didnt know they had the colored ones
7315994 can you see the difference the females have eyelashes and pearls the males have the bow ties
7315995 we just got back from a three week vacation celebrating our 50th anniversary we went through yellowstone with the grandchildren and stayed at a dude ranch we put over 5 000 miles on the car
7315996 friends come over for dinner and they come out here and see my clocks
7315997 mom would put everyone in the car us three kids and probably a bunch of cousins and off wed go wed head for roundup montana her home town we used to go every fourth of july and visit

7316001 civil rights lawyer 8 years in illinois senate 3 years as a u s senator
7316002 there are only two qualifications a candidate must be over 35 and must have been born in the usa we may have 200 million people qualified to be president right now
7316003 age and citizenship requirements us constitution article ii section 1
7316004 no person except a natural born citizen or a citizen of the united states at the time of the adoption of this constitution shall be eligible to the office of president neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years and been fourteen years a resident within the united states

7316006 at least some of those who were previously enthusiastic about the founding aims of the eu both social and economic are now expressing unease
7316007 successive decisions have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools
7316008 these and other decisions have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project
7316009 ignoring this trend within the eu and its impact on people of faith has inevitable political and social consequences not least on levels of support for the project itself
7316010 the prevailing culture and social agenda within the eu would at least appear to be driven by the secular tradition rather than by the christian memory and heritage of the vast majority of member states

7316035 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7316036 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7316037 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7316038 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7316039 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7316040 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7316041 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7316042 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7316043 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7316044 the trust provider requirements and market access program are at least a step in the right direction
7316045 its not the system that is flawed but it is only some of the members that are flawed

7316059 the size of the price increase is the real surprise
7316060 the risk of tweaking formulas too much is that slowly and almost imperceptibly you gradually alter the taste so that after five alterations you have something that tastes different than it did five years ago
7316061 but even though were still fighting a hard battle and we still have a deficit were really really really in a lot better shape than we were three years ago were turning the corner
7316062 there remains however a perception that the festival has been slow to pick up on a burgeoning freak folk scene that would be a natural fit with its jericho beach park location
7316063 im quite surprised that we havent had anyone like sufjan stevens or devendra banhart or will oldham or animal collective
7316064 perhaps those people are a little more expensive i do appreciate the non star system that our festival has always had but i do think theres a lot going on in the new songwriters scene that would be really great in a big park with all those lovely people

7316147 were wearing aprons but everybody whos here the agents the editors the faculty the fellows the other contributors knows that this person whos waiting on you is going to be a very important writer in four or five years
7316148 so for us its kind of amazing and i think for everybody its kind of amazing
7316149 its humbling we handle compost things spill theres a lot of running
7316150 these are people i would never ever ever talk to even in a social situation
7316151 but you have to go up to them and ask do you want chicken or the vegetarian option and when you start talking to them that way when youre getting them their coffee and their dessert a natural sort of conversation starts happening
7316152 i took a lot of naps and a lot of advil
7316153 its like having tiger woods help you with your putting
7316154 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7316155 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7316156 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7316157 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7316158 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7316159 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7316160 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7316161 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7316162 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should ben affleck be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us
7316163 why shouldnt he be in denver he has nothing to be ashamed of
7316164 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps
7316165 i dont think oprah hurts i think she helps a lot

7316170 an integer indicating the number of passes scene antialiasing requires to render a single frame for this canvas3d if this value is zero scene antialiasing is not supported if this value is one multisampling antialiasing is used otherwise the number indicates the number of rendering passes needed
7316171 im not sure if this is the case but afaik aa doesnt work on off screen rendering and jcanvas3d does use off screen rendering
7316172 scene antialiasing is ignored in pure immediate mode but is supported in mixed immediate mode
7316173 a lot of guys were sick and tired of hearing it
7316174 but i always kept telling people shoot saskatchewan was the no 1 team and they have less sacks than we do its not always about the sacks but those are the things that people see on tv right but it did feel good to end the slump
7316175 i was very pleased that our defence made the plays that helped us win the game
7316176 i thought the defence after that first series when the leos methodically marched the ball 78 yards for a major really responded they played good football against a good offensive football team
7316177 the key was we bothered the quarterback a little bit more than we had been in the past
7316178 weve been bothering the quarterback for the last couple of weeks
7316179 but the thing is we just havent been getting there getting home is what we call it
7316180 we didnt know whether to high five or what to do
7316181 saying we havent been able to finish games all around from the defensive line all the way back to us we played a solid game right until the end
7316182 we came out with a disclaimer you could say to all those so called experts who said we couldnt finish
7316183 guys on the sideline were saying if the offence cant get it done well get it done

7316193 very few people know actually what transpired during this process
7316194 but i can tell you the first person that he sat down and talked to at all about this vice presidential issue was sen clinton they had a discussion in early june about it
7316195 he spent more time with sen clinton alone talking about issues than he has with joe biden or anyone else in the last couple of months
7316196 look he has a high regard for sen clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt sen biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7316197 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton
7316198 she had 50 of the democratic vote obama had 50 of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party

7316211 there is absolutely no reason to have done this trailer which is a bad joke
7316212 the marketing people probably thought the only way they could get the young popcorn eating brigade to see this film was if they made some comparison with diana but they did not need to and should not have done it
7316213 i dont actually think that georgiana died in a carriage crash
7316214 marketing is nothing to do with me you are going to have to ask whoever it was at the film company that thought that that was a good idea about that one

7316235 pallets of organic tomatoes from californian had begun coming in just a few dollars cheaper its hard to believe given the amount of truck fuel involved but transportation is tax deductable for the corporations so we tax payers paid for that shipping the californian growers only needed the economics of scale on their side a cheap army of pickers and customer who would reliably opt for the lower prices

7316268 mijn spel is beter dan in 2004 mijn beste jaar
7316269 de realiteit is dat ik niet goed stond te putten en dat ik het in de laatste ronde heb laten liggen
7316270 maar ik ben wel gewoon bij de laatste vijftig ge indigd ik heb laten zien dat ik dit niveau nog aankan
7316271 im glad i got the chance to help the team again
7316272 you dont get that many chances and to have another chance with the bases loaded i was excited about another opportunity i was thankful for another shot at it
7316273 when youre hitting third on any team youre hitting third for a reason
7316274 hes more often than not put good swings on balls driven in big runs
7316275 it was only a matter of time before their bats come alive
7316276 thats as well as hes thrown the ball since early in the year
7316277 hes getting better he threw more quality strikes to get ahead
7316278 im going to have a talk with him sunday and see how we can help the young man he is struggling
7316279 he has been working real hard he has been bunting more lately and hes hitting the ball on the ground

7316283 yeah i had a good outing but its not fun losing

7316285 i have to continue to work and continue to go out there and put up zeros
7316286 it was a lot of fun knowing all my pitches were going for strikes

7316290 were capable of scoring definitely more than three runs a night
7316291 when were clicking were going to average about five runs a game when were really good once we get consistent and start scoring runs like we can and our pitching stays as good as its been were going to win quite a few games
7316292 were putting a lot of pressure on our pitchers because were not scoring runs
7316293 first of all let me take the opportunity to congratulate the european union for its successful transition to the euro from its twelve different currencies everyone was pleasantly surprised at how smooth and swift the switchover took place considering it involved the largest currency swap undertaken in history the question that comes to mind is whether the euro will establish itself in world financial markets thus challenging the supremacy of the us dollar and consequently trigger a change in the dollars dominance in oil markets as we all know the mighty dollar has reigned supreme since 1945 and in the last few years has even gained more ground with the economic dominance of the united states a situation that may not change in the near future by the late 90s more than four fifths of all foreign exchange transactions and half of all world exports were denominated in dollars in addition the us currency accounts for about two thirds of all official exchange reserves the worlds dependency on us dollars to pay for trade has seen countries bound to dollar reserves which are disproportionately higher than americas share in global output the share of the dollar in the denomination of world trade is also much higher than the share of the us in world trade having said that it is worthwhile to note that in the long run the euro is not at such a disadvantage versus the dollar when one compares the relative sizes of the economies involved especially given the eu enlargement plans moreover the euro zone has a bigger share of global trade than the us and while the us has a huge current account deficit the euro area has a more or balanced external accounts position one of the more compelling arguments for keeping oil pricing and payments in dollars has been that the us remains a large importer of oil despite being a substantial crude producer itself however looking at the statistics of crude oil exports one notes that the euro zone is an even larger importer of oil and petroleum products than the us
7316294 it must also be recalled that the links between crude oil and the dollar are deeply embedded in economics politics and trading traditions naturally the trading of oil in dollars has served the interests of the us giving it an immediate advantage over other countries because it carries no currency exchange risk for most other oil consumers around the world the pricing and payment of crude in dollars increases the risk for these countries because of currency fluctuations when the dollar rises against other currencies the price of oil is more expensive for the rest of the world thus potentially increasing inflation in these countries
7316295 despite this let us examine some of the issues surrounding the denomination of the oil bill with the euro in mind firstly it is good to note that oil producers and big crude consumers and importers from non dollar areas like the eu have common interests they are both interested not only in stability of oil prices and a reduction in price volatility but also in the stable currencies in other words they would like to minimize oil price risk and currency risk producers and consumers may differ as to the desired oil price level although i think they are probably not so far apart on that question but they would both easily agree that currency risk is undesirable from the eus point of view it is clear that europe would prefer to see payments for oil shift from the dollar to the euro which effectively removes the currency risk it would also increase the demand for the euro and thus help to raise its value moreover oil were to shift to the euro it could provide a boost to the global acceptability of the single currency there are also very strong trade links between opec member countries mcs and the euro zone with more than 45 per cent of total merchandise imports of opec mcs coming from the countries of the euro zone while opec mcs are main suppliers of oil and crude oil products to europe
7316296 of major importance to the ultimate success of the euro in terms of the oil pricing will be if europes two major oil producers the united kingdom and norway join the single currency naturally the future integration of these two countries into the euro zone and europe will be important considering they are the regions two major oil producers in the north sea which is home to the international crude oil benchmark brent this might create a momentum to shift the oil pricing system to euros however from todays perspective even after the uk joins the single currency there would seem to be little incentive for londons international petroleum exchange ipe where brent is traded to switch its brent crude oil and gas oil contracts to euros since both are traded internationally and the dollar is at the centre of a complex global oil trading and hedging system there is more chance that the ipe will consider changing its natural gas and power contracts to euros with respect to petroleum products it appears that here the euro may make some inroads within the euro zone petroleum products to the final consumer are now sold in euros highlighting the disparity in final product prices within the eu at present the only spot market that has adopted the euro is the hamburg barge market which previously used deutschmarks so what is the opec position on this critical questions can the organization consider switching its crude oil pricing from dollars to euros or will a basket of currencies be used because crude oil contracts are currently traded in dollars and the prices of opec crudes are determined by using complex formulas derived from marker crudes such as brent and wti there is not much the organization can do unilaterally until and unless there is a switch of denomination in these markets opec has no control over the quotations of these marker crudes whereas in the past the organization did set the official selling prices that has all changed with the introduction of market related prices which saw the system change from a sellers to a buyers market or at least where market forces now dictate prices moreover the entire infrastructure of the oil market has been based around the dollar and that will be hard to displace however as previously mentioned a lot depends on britain and norway in determining what their level of eu integration will be and whether their marker crude brent could be traded in euros

7316304 but joe bidens going to grow on the american people very fast
7316305 they had a discussion back in early june about it and he spent more time with senator clinton alone talking about issues than he has with joe biden or anyone else
7316306 knew her he knew her very well and so there wasnt the same need as there was for other candidates
7316307 theres no question that people had strong feelings about their nominee we went from beginning to end
7316308 i think thats going to be the role of the convention to really be a unifying time
7316309 hes got to talk about economic issues and hes got to be more clear
7316310 we need certainly senator obama to let the americans know what his plan is for as president of the united states how hes going to help rebuild restore the middle class
7316311 i dont accept that thats what barack obama hasnt been doing and i think that he will give a clear picture again this week of where we have to go

7316326 unforgiveness is like drinking poison hoping that someone else dies
7316327 everyone says forgiveness is a lovely idea until they have something to forgive
7316328 forgiveness does not involve a literal forgetting forgiveness involves remembering graciously the forgiver remembers the true though painful parts but without the embellishment of angry adjectives and adverbs that stir up contempt
7316329 first you recall the hurt objectively without blame and self victimization then you empathize by trying to imagine the viewpoint of the person who wronged you the altruistic part involves getting people to think about a time they were forgiven and how that felt when it s time to commit to forgiveness people usually say not yet but when they finally do they must then hold on to forgiveness
7316330 what s important is working it through and achieving resolution whether it leads to forgiveness or not forgiveness involves wishing the other well you re already there if you don t wish them ill

7316380 in the new international energy order countries can be divided into energy surplus and energy deficit nations
7316381 deficit states like china japan and the united states are compelled to pay ever higher prices for imported fuels as they compete with one another for those materials the surplus states are prepared to supply the surplus states on the other hand are sure to become richer as they parcel out their increasingly valuable commodities at whatever prices the markets will bear
7316382 the whole industry of the last century is completely different from the industry of today in the 1970s 85 of the worlds oil reserves were managed by international oil companies the seven sisters today the situation is completely different most reserves are now managed by national oil companies and everything now gravitates around them at the beginning of the 21st century national oil companies turned into the principal actors in the petroleum sector
7316383 to ensure our shareholders get enough of our revenue and we have 27 million shareholders the venezuelan people we have a responsibility to develop our reserves to allow them to have a better life this is the main difference between how the industry was managed in the past and how it will be managed in the future
7316384 this proves that we can be a profitable oil company with a lot of social responsibility
7316385 we believe the work here will involve cooperation instead of competition
7316386 even though some competition will be there but cooperation is an important issue to be considered
7316387 all these companies are participating in projects with us either upstream or downstream
7316388 the magic word is how we can establish cooperation with their regimes so these companies can be successful and sustainable over time we believe cooperation not competition is the key word to establish business relationships with these companies
7316389 between us canada and venezuela will have more than half of the oil reserves around the world

7316391 in terms of heavy oil production and heavy oil markets we need to share our learning lessons experiences and challenges with canadian companies canada and venezuela will share the same markets as well as the same challenges why not cooperate to make the markets more efficient
7316392 we need human resources skilled people and we are here to tell you this is another area where there are opportunities for the people of alberta

7316452 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
7316453 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
7316454 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently
7316455 i dont want to pre empt it but we do know that its not getting any cheaper to participate in the olympics if you fund at the same level you move backwards

7316463 christian groups who flouted a chinese ban on foreign missionaries are calling their underground evangelizing during the olympic games a success
7316464 we did see some conversions said christian missionary mark taylor of pensacola fla
7316465 the christians came in on tourist visas and said they were involved in sports or cultural activities
7316466 one christian group made headlines this week when chinese authorities confiscated 315 chinese language bibles found in their checked luggage when they arrived in the southwestern city of kunming from thailand
7316467 it was almost like they were treating us like criminals
7316468 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
7316469 even the rev franklin graham son of the evangelist billy graham said during a visit to china this year that he did not support illegal missionary work during the olympics
7316470 we know what you should be doing and how you should be doing it let us the enlightened ones show you poor benighted souls the way

7316478 there is no doubt the combined efforts of all these agencies resulted in reduced overall levels of disorder
7316479 in the end we remain dependent upon the responsibility of individuals involved
7316480 you walk up to it and motion sensors trigger water to spray out in a mist and run down the wall it is atomised water so if they did get paint on the wall it is very easy to remove in the morning

7316499 her interview in the mixed zone afterwards was one of the most refreshing pieces of sports interviewing ive ever seen she was such a breath of fresh air we had a lot of fun with that story
7316500 while it has obviously been so successful for team gb i also love some of the stories that have come out of the other 200 countries here
7316501 it is important to remember there are places in the world suffering a lot of pain and thats the power of sport it does not solve problems but it can make you feel better
7316502 what moved me most was the attitude of this man the attitude to say this is a big failure i take responsibility but i will come back and i will win gold
7316503 the games is not only about winning its about the struggle of everyday athletes to reach his or her own limits
7316504 her father died while she was living in italy then her mother fell ill so she tried to get back to cuba to see her mother
7316505 they would not grant her a visa but in the end she got one but then on the plane home she got a text to say her mother had died
7316506 so she switched planes to meet up with her team mates and got to beijing in time to play at the olympics

7316518 where are asian ipod buyers supposed to get their music limewire other file sharing sites we dont blame walmart for not selling us a whole bunch of stuff but being able to buy songs on itunes is arguably part of the ipod experience or at least apple sells it as such so if theyre going to sell us a product here that only works part of the way they should at least level with us and say why they have to do it dont you think
7316519 ironically by not selling music to large swathes of asia apple is indirectly encouraging piracy because ipod owners wouldnt be able to buy songs online even if they wanted to
7316520 lets understand piracy first i found you get really unreliable downloads you have to try several times to get the song and then you get it and find it was encoded by a ten year old with four seconds missing at the end you dont get to listen first you dont get artwork and its stealing we via itms offer fast reliable downloads from our vast server farms we are very very good at this its not stealing its good karma website music stores suck they dont work
7316521 the most common format of music on an ipod is stolen
7316522 i cant answer the hypothetical its more its the way that we were directed to posture looking outward
7316523 the norad mission is threefold norads first responsibility is to provide surveillance and control of the airspace covering north america specifically the airspace of canada and the united states this mission is based on agreements between the two governments the second part of norads mission is to provide the ncas national command authorities with tactical warning and attack assessment of an aerospace attack against north america this information is essential to providing those in command with information to aid them in making decisions on how to respond to an attack against north america norads third responsibility is to provide an appropriate response to any form of air attack norad was created to provide a defense against the threat from air breathing aircraft specifically the threat from long range bombers however over the years the threat has changed now norad must provide an appropriate response to a multitude of threats to include the air launched cruise missile alcm and the sea launched cruise missile slcm
7316524 norad defines air sovereignty as providing surveillance and control of the territorial airspace which includes 1 intercepting and destroying uncontrollable air objects 2 tracking hijacked aircraft 3 assisting aircraft in distress 4 escorting communist civil aircraft and 5 intercepting suspect aircraft including counterdrug operations and peacetime military intercepts
7316525 norad defines sovereign airspace as the airspace over a nations territory internal waters and territorial seas norads territorial seas extend 12 miles from the continental united states alaska and canada sovereign airspace above a nations territory is unlimited
7316526 aircraft flying over our air space are monitored seven days a week 24 hours a day much of the identifying process is done by hand flight plans from the federal aviation administration faa are compiled in logs and have to be manually searched to identify aircraft
7316527 the air operations center aoc also known as the air defense operations center adoc maintains constant surveillance of north american airspace to prevent overflight by hostile aircraft it tracks over 2 5 million aircraft annually the adoc collects and consolidates surveillance information on suspected drug carrying aircraft entering or operating within north america and provides this information to counternarcotics agencies
7316528 one ongoing mission of the battle management center is to coordinate
7316529 in 1998 canada posses the ability to detect identify and if necessary intercept aircraft over canadian territory
7316530 its charter through continuous training and a realistic exercise program probably the biggest of these exercises is amalgam warrior which is held twice annually in the fall for the east coast and in the spring for the west coast the five day fall amalgam warrior put americans and canadians through their paces challenging forces in three areas coinciding with the commands aerospace warning air sovereignty and air defense missions the exercise was conducted in real time with a fictitious world political scenario which prompted norad forces to transition from a peacetime posture to a war fighting stance the threat escalated from tracking unknown aircraft which filed bad flight plans or wandered off course and in flight emergencies all four hijacked aircraft on 9 11 were also in flight emergencies to terrorist aircraft attacks and large scale bomber strike missions
7316531 the dramatically changed threat and development of post cold war defense policies suggest real possibilities for shifting norads focus from deterring massive nuclear attack to defending both nations canada and the united states by maintaining air sovereignty the size of the core force would equate to that required to perform the peacetime air sovereignty mission
7316532 according to the chairman chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the air defense force was structured to intercept the former soviet unions long range bomber force if it attacked over the north pole
7316533 i cant answer the hypothetical its more its the way that we were directed to posture looking outward
7316534 30 000 people with six or more criminal convictions in the past year
7316535 esta convenci n no es m s que una excusa para que la polic a adquiera y acumule equipos paramilitares que se usar n contra los ciudadanos mucho despu s que haya terminado

7316539 we are very pleased to sign this contract with mr norman cheng president of emi asia as he is one of the successful pioneers of the asian record industry the chinese music market is very exciting with long term growth potential particularly in the digital music sector but it is still challenging with regards to financial and other aspects such as the rampant piracy problem
7316540 i am pleased to announce this news for typhoon as it is a great opportunity for us for the entire greater china we have a very good model of cooperation as the chinese artists under typhoon have developed in a familiar environment while at the same time these artists can also enter the international market through emi the international music industry is indeed facing challenges but with the increase in the number of consumers the channels for music products have reached unprecedented numbers in many markets and particularly in mainland china there will be excellent business opportunities
7316541 the fact is we all know that the physical record business is in a slump although physical sales are declining there are now more ways in which consumers can listen to music and it is diversified computers mp3 players mobile phones different platforms so that music can truly exist everywhere and thats why i believe the potential is great

7316627 well when they come to leadership conference during alumni week ill anoint them all and stir them up again ill encourage them to get out there and do what theyre supposed to do
7316628 i want to give you a characteristic of the new millennial church

7316630 the churches will continue to grow and the local church will be important but sending power im putting back into the church for it has not been there for many a decade
7316631 its been in some churches but for most its been a visitation and not residential but im bringing it back as a residential anointing and operation of my churches that are following me in full pursuit
7316632 and im going to give it to you and put it in your church
7316633 i want you to send 500 of your graduates to the nations of the world where there has been little to no gospel and let them labor and work for a minimum of one year and you pay for it
7316634 well lord if thats what you want me to do ill do it
7316635 as a sign to you that this is my perfect will for you and your church in the next two months i am going to pay off all your ministry bills and then ill begin to send money to you to help get the first ones out
7316636 as he was catching a taxi back to his hotel the spirit of the lord spoke to roberts liardon
7316637 we want to obey god and run the race that he has called us to but who will show us how

7316642 das hat man vom ersten tag an gesehen gestern holte ich pole und heute den sieg mit der schnellsten rennrunde zum dr berstreuen mehr kann man nicht verlangen vor allem bei meinem 100 grand prix und jeden einzelnen bin ich mit einem ferrari motor gefahren
7316643 wir m ssen uns die zuverl ssigkeit genau ansehen ich bin zuversichtlich dass das team wei welche gegenma nahmen man treffen kann um auf dieses problem zu reagieren so wie es das fr her schon immer gemacht hat
7316644 ich glaube aber nicht dass ich trotz dieses schlechten ergebnisses aus dem titelrennen bin es sind noch sechs rennen zu fahren und 60 punkte zu holen wir haben gesehen wie schnell sich die situation ndern kann auch wenn mir klar ist dass die dinge nun schwieriger sind
7316645 es war mein fehler und leider bin ich ber denjenigen gefahren der getankt hat wir m ssen schauen was da wirklich passiert ist
7316646 zum gl ck ist piero timpini nicht zu viel passiert ich w nsche ihm das beste und hoffe es geht ihm bald besser
7316647 es war nur in der letzten kurve leider wei ich nicht was da passiert ist aber wir m ssen untersuchen was mit dem motor nicht gestimmt hat vielleicht ist es hnlich dem was felipe im vorigen rennen passiert ist
7316648 wir wissen was die probleme waren aber leider konnten wir sie noch nicht l sen hoffentlich k nnen wir das jetzt im n chsten test abarbeiten und eine l sung finden wenn wir das qualifying richtig hinbekommen wird das viel helfen
7316649 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7316650 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber
7316651 the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent
7316652 thats where we are today in the middle of a financial crisis with the economy sliding into recession with monetary policy at maximum easing and fiscal transfers impotent
7316653 more than a year into the most challenging financial crisis of our times we now face a complex and interlocking combination of rising inflation declining growth tightening credit conditions and widespread liquidity tensions
7316654 these adjustments will not be painless and ensuring that they take place in an orderly manner will pose substantial challenges for policymakers

7316679 some of these pragmatic issues may have been tackled already by the various private companies including oil industry giants chevron and shell which are already researching algae fuel but a published scientific report on these fundamentals will be a major benefit to other researchers looking into algae biofuel

7316685 en s lo 16 a os las mujeres pasaron de tener 5 4 ni os a 2 8 lo que provoc un impacto tremendo en la estructura de la poblaci n ah empez el descenso
7316686 pero dice el fen meno es transitorio termina cuando en la sociedad disminuye la cantidad de ni os y aumenta la de adultos mayores una tendencia a la que nos vamos encaminando
7316687 ni el estado ni nadie dice puede decidir por la mujer en cuanto a sus hijos s tiene que generar las condiciones para que sta pueda desarrollarse la maternidad no es individual la familia el estado y el sector privado no deben dejarla sola y si hoy tenemos un pa s envejecido en buena parte es porque somos un pa s machista que no se adapta a darle mejores condiciones a la mujer con hijos
7316688 de ah que la mayor parte de las pol ticas p blicas est dirigida a ese sector con programas como chile crece contigo que apunta a apoyar la maternidad
7316689 donde menos ha disminuido la natalidad dice es entre las adolescentes con m s de mil embarazos por a o
7316690 hoy afirma est descendiendo el n mero absoluto de ni os tenemos 3 millones de estudiantes pero de aqu al 2015 la cifra descender a 2 millones y medio vamos a quedar con un sobrestock de escuelas y de profesores y esto va a pasar en s lo siete a os m s ya estamos en ese problema
7316691 las implicaciones del envejecimiento demogr fico debieran constituir una de las principales preocupaciones en materia econ mica y social se requiere de una mesa de trabajo de todos los actores para enfrentar un tema que no es de futuro sino que lo tenemos ahora
7316692 los ni os que se cr an en hogares sin pap y mam en promedio se demoran m s en su desarrollo cognitivo y de comportamiento
7316693 todas las pol ticas de igualdad de oportunidades como el chile crece contigo quedan con una pata coja si no se aborda el tema de la familia
7316694 en la pr ctica explica el economista ello equivale a la introducci n de regulaciones de la vida en pareja que transforman la convivencia en una versi n m s flexible del matrimonio
7316695 las pol ticas de igualdad de oportunidades quedan con una pata coja si no se aborda el tema de la familia
7316696 se requiere una mesa de trabajo de todos los actores para enfrentar un tema que no es de futuro sino que de ahora
7316697 la ca da que chile est sufriendo es m s pronunciada que la que experimentaron en su momento muchos pa ses europeos que hoy no encuentran c mo revertir este fen meno
7316698 todos los estudios dice entre ellos los realizados por el instituto nacional de la juventud muestran que la instituci n que m s valoran nuestros j venes es la familia es el principal anhelo que tienen para su futuro y sin embargo no est n formando familias es decir no est n cumpliendo su proyecto de vida m s querido
7316699 necesitamos pol ticas p blicas de apoyo a la familia que impliquen acciones transversales en materia de educaci n vivienda trabajo salud etc por eso es urgente recordar el llamado que hace un par de a os nos hicieran nuestros obispos a reflexionar sobre qu chile queremos construir
7316700 la ca da que chile est sufriendo es m s pronunciada que la que experimentaron en su momento muchos pa ses europeos que hoy no encuentran c mo revertir este fen meno

7316702 the uk is england scotland wales and northern ireland altogether such and such is in england are you one of these people who only calls england uk
7316703 the athletes were never expected to carry the water for the activists it is a matter of individual conscience
7316704 ultimately it is more of an indictment of the atmosphere of intimidation and censorship imposed by the chinese government not to mention the confusing messages
7316705 id suspect a major reason for this is that olympic athletes see the games as a once in lifetime opportunity to shine in their sport stand out and possibly cash in
7316706 its a moment that theyve been training and preparing for all their lives and to risk tarnishing all their hard work with a protest or political statement just isnt worth it
7316707 the goal was not to stick a finger in chinas eye but rather to raise world consciousness about how china underwrites mass slaughter as a way to urge the international community to intercede with beijing
7316708 ongoing efforts to create positive and lasting peace in the region and progress toward the shared goal of a peace agreement in 2008
7316709 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7316710 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7316711 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7316712 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7316713 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7316714 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7316715 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7316716 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7316717 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7316718 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7316719 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7316720 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7316721 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7316722 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7316723 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7316724 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7316725 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7316726 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7316727 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7316728 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should ben affleck be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us
7316729 why shouldnt he be in denver he has nothing to be ashamed of
7316730 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps
7316731 i dont think oprah hurts i think she helps a lot
7316732 they havent called but if they need me im on a plane whatever they want
7316733 i just want to study and be with my mom
7316734 a lot of guys try to run the same game that they ran over there but they end up falling on their face
7316735 you see we know spanish but we dont know the exact words and when we try to explain to somebody something theyre like huh
7316736 they shouldnt have deported you so soon after your surgery
7316737 i cant walk both my feet are in bad shape
7316738 finish high school and then you can come here at least here you have your grandparents your cousins over there what do you have
7316739 they deport them at any hour at 10 p m at midnight and in some cases they wind up in the street or they sleep in the offices of mexican immigration agents
7316740 to try our best not to bring women or juveniles after dark
7316741 i dont know how but im going to make it
7316742 its a noble thing that they want the family to be reunited but they are exposing them to danger

7316750 questions behind the looking glass a carrollian introduction to philosophy
7316751 sherry l ackerman ph d is professor of philosophy at the college of the siskiyous in northern california u s a as well as an international dressage clinician as an active scholar with the international society for neoplatonic studies she has authored numerous papers and journal articles she is also one of the american equine industrys foremost proponents of eco spirituality and nature mysticism
7316752 one of the most beautiful community colleges sic campuses in california
7316753 the myth he crafted however was neither social nor sexual it was spiritual
7316754 the victorian cult of the child was more accurately a reappearance of the orphic theogony for the belief in a divine child
7316755 carroll chose to sing a new song instead of dogmatic liturgy he sang the theosophists intellectual hymn to love and preached from carefully crafted allegory instead of from a pulpit
7316756 i feel that i have constructed a strong preliminary case for a carroll whose mysticism colored every aspect of his life the mystical consciousness considers unity as both an internal and external focus as it seeks the truth about reality
7316757 carroll turns alice into odysseus journeying home to ithaca the heros journey always involves the departure an initiation and the return
7316758 carroll concealed his secret carefully leaving it so that it could be understood only by the efforts of the studious and wise
7316759 ive often said that if i understood the two alice books id have very little left to understand about literature actually i think the alice books while they carry over begin rather than sum up a new twist to fiction that has to do with intellectual paradox amp the disintegrating of the ego
7316760 i suppose the fascination with alice is not that shes a child in the state of innocence but that shes a preternatural child what seven year old girls would have been like without the fall
7316761 in a slightly different but related area one feels that alice could hardly have held her wonderland together if she had even reached the menarche much less become an adult
7316762 did a masterful job of concealing his secrets from the crowd
7316763 matter is not a name in the way that humpty dumpty is a name carrolls story about humpty dumpty is suggestive of a satirization of berkeleys nominalism humpty dumpty from this perspective subscribed to an extreme form of nominalism according to which all that is common to a group of particulars is their being called by the same name
7316764 carrolls ultimate work in progress the evolution of his own consciousness is available with some literary archeology to be showcased
7316765 we find carroll himself irreconcilably and probably unconsciously suspended between the phenomenal and noumenal realms
7316766 it appears that carroll like most academics of this period confused the map with the territory
7316767 as previously noted carroll always vehemently denied that charles lutwidge dodgson and lewis carroll shared the same identity they were very much two different personae

7316830 a swim on part in the goldfish bowl a memoir
7316831 i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7316832 the contrast was all the more striking because until that point shed always had a memory like a website
7316833 from the fateful day of our lunch tell tale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge
7316834 whereas previously you would never have had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7316835 it might be something innocuous such as what time is my car coming or when am i going to the hairdresser but the fact she needed to repeat them opened a new and frightening chapter in our lives
7316836 i had to learn to be patient a quality i admit is in short supply i also had to learn she had an illness and that it wasnt personal
7316837 thats the worst thing about dementia it gets you every time

7316839 losing dad was truly awful for mum not least because her dementia meant she kept forgetting he was dead
7316840 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7316841 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7316842 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7316843 as if her dementia had sharpened her powers of long term recall

7316899 i think that generally theres a need to completely drop all the paradigms and to rethink the youth market and how we tackle it
7316900 you need to completely reinvestigate and get much closer to your consumers to develop the insight that you need
7316901 its become more and more challenging than ever to actually segment and profile the youth market because its a moving target all the time
7316902 the youth are much more spoilt for choice than we were theres so much out there that they have to digest that i think the biggest challenge brands have is to actually keep the youths attention and to keep them engaged
7316903 youth seek to be part of a community so creating some sort of a community for them and helping them feel that they are members of it and can participate that they can engage and express themselves will help a lot
7316904 we looked for insights in the quirkiest of places be it facebook profiles weblogs graffiti or matrimonial sites
7316905 there is still a lot of resistance to this but any company looking to channel or direct its marketing spend towards the youth market desperately desperately needs to become part of the youth world and really live side by side with them and really develop that insight
7316906 there are a lot of companies that are starting these initiatives but i dont think a lot of them have cracked the market
7316907 simply dont know how to market properly within social networks
7316908 too many marketers create dull non interactive pages inside social networks
7316909 our research clearly shows that ongoing promotion and advertising as well as the use of even relatively simple forms of engagement are vital to the success of branded social networking pages
7316910 even simple forms of engagement such as contests on average doubled the number of friends acquired by each branded page
7316911 giving them an avenue to express themselves and be part of a companys product its marketing message
7316912 their attention span is very short so they lose interest very fast
7316913 the athletes were never expected to carry the water for the activists it is a matter of individual conscience
7316914 ultimately it is more of an indictment of the atmosphere of intimidation and censorship imposed by the chinese government not to mention the confusing messages
7316915 id suspect a major reason for this is that olympic athletes see the games as a once in lifetime opportunity to shine in their sport stand out and possibly cash in
7316916 its a moment that theyve been training and preparing for all their lives and to risk tarnishing all their hard work with a protest or political statement just isnt worth it

7316925 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7316926 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7316927 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7316928 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7316929 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7316930 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression

7316961 the icc board on sunday agreed unanimously to postpone the icc champions trophy until october 2009
7316962 pakistan will retain the right to host the tournament but it was agreed that if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the icc board would have the right to decide about the tournaments location
7316963 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete in the icc champions trophy had reservations about touring there which could not be removed in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams

7316988 i hope you dont mind but ive got some questions i should probably start with my story over the last 3 years ive had real problems with being sick it started when i first started university i started to be sick just randomly one day ive had issues with food since i was 15 and used to just not eat to keep myself thin i thought it was a stomach bug but it didnt go away i was in and out of hospital and i was too scared to admit to the doctors that i was finding it a relief finally i could eat whatever i wanted and it didnt matter eventually i started to be less sick i could eat a couple of meals every few days and they let me go home eventually i could control when i was being sick obviously as i was able to digest more i put on weight i started being sick every time i felt bad about myself and my mother made it worse i ended up in counseling after a very kind doctor saw that i was having problems but the counseling wasnt really about my weight it was more about the issues with my family im now being sick very infrequently but its still when im feeling low about myself ive put on a lot of weight since this all started i suppose because im getting better do you have any advice for someone like me im a bit overweight now and trying hard to lose weight just to get down to a healthy weight i think im on the road to recovery and im not even sure i had have an eating disorder but am a little concerned as i dont want to lapse back in to my old habits im sorry if this doesnt make any sense i suppose i just wanted someones opinion someone who had been though the whole disorder thing thanks in advance

7317006 i do appreciate that you were always there for me and i want to thank you for that i could always count on you for comfort and to make me feel better when there was no one else around or i felt lost or lonely or bored you gave me what felt like power and control when i felt desperately powerless and out of control i may not have been able to make it without you
7317007 but my life is getting better all the time im enjoying taking the risks that once terrified me and i realize my dreams are worth fighting for you see i no longer need you and i certainly dont want you so take care and ill see ya

7317046 even though its time spent in a game to us its real the promisses the friendships its all real
7317047 is not so much whether st marys should be closed down but whether st marys will close itself down by practices that separate it from communion with the roman catholic church
7317048 in reality st marys south brisbane has taken a roman catholic parish and established its own brand of religion
7317049 undoubtedly it does good it promotes a strong sense of community opens its doors to all who wish to come but its own style of worship and sacramental practice can hardly be described as roman catholic
7317050 im not particularly hopeful myself but its up to the community they will find the right solution

7317054 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7317055 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7317056 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7317057 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out
7317058 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7317059 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7317060 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track

7317074 that evil is not from god nor is it in god nor has it existed from the beginning nor is it of any substantive existence but men in departing from the theoria of the good began to devise and imagine that which is not according to their desires
7317075 for evil does not come from good not through good or the result of good
7317076 to describe what man communes with in his nous seen in the purity of his nous is interrupted when mans remembrance of god in his nous is interrupted the inevitable result is that his memory is tied to

7317096 i have friends in spain in italy and they speak to me about other clubs and i know that im privileged to be where i am and i dont want to lose it im still young i want to win things for the club i want to get experience and i want to compete because when you see football around the world you see very few teams that play the way that we play and i just enjoy the way we play
7317097 i came here when i was 16 and i feel its my home now i think i will be lucky to be here as long as i can to play for arsenal i dont even want to think about whether i would find a similar environment elsewhere because im happy where i am whenever people say another team is the best in the world i know where i am and how i feel here which is the most important thing

7317101 how can we bring hashems kindness into the world especially when we face difficulties from every direction that seem to overwhelm us the answer is that by attaching ourselves to kindness we draw down hashems kindness onto the world
7317102 the power of this is revealed in a beautiful piece from the tana dbei eliyahu rabba at the end of chapter 23
7317103 what was the reason why they made this pact to do kindness to one another
7317104 in truth it was indeed so in the end because this matter was the root cause of the redemption as the verse states in your kindness you made them rest this nation that you redeemed you led with your strength etc
7317105 in your kindness you made them rest this refers to the kindness of the people of israel you led with your strength this refers to the torah for in truth they also had torah in egypt as it states in yoma 28b that even when the jews were in egypt they did not stop learning

7317140 der markt bewegt sich seitw rts dabei gibt es jede menge kreativit t bei den europ ischen entwicklern von handyspielen und viele tolle ideen
7317141 in japan bekommt der entwickler gut 90 prozent in den usa noch rund 70 und in europa gerade noch 50 prozent pro verkauftem spiel
7317142 der handyspielesektor galt lange zeit als ein sehr umsatzkr ftiger markt bisher konnte er sein potenzial aber noch nicht wirklich entfalten
7317143 zun chst einmal k mpft die branche mit dem problem dass es sehr viele unterschiedliche arten von handy games gibt die auf verschiedensten plattformen angeboten werden
7317144 zu diesem vertriebsproblem kommt erschwerend hinzu dass entwickler von handyspielen kein einheitliches interface zur verf gung haben f r das sie spiele entwickeln k nnten

7317148 i havent seen a definite release date for the blackberry curve on the at amp t network and the reported issues with the 3g radio may be delaying the release there were reports that the infineon chip was a possible cause of the problem

7317152 the 3g does not make me talk any faster laugh if i bring up a web page and it takes me an extra second or even minute i am not worried as edge or 3g works very well i can see if your in the middle of a train track and a train is coming and you were wondering what time it left the station before you get hit by it i can see then how 3g heck 10g would be really a good thing for you before you get hit be happy

7317157 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able bring to the table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7317158 from a published law review article without quotation or attribution
7317159 the fighting in georgia underscored the need to bring some foreign policy experience to the ticket its critical that the veep be willing and able to take an axe or at least an ice pick to the presidential candidate of the other party senator obama also needs to improve his performance with lunch bucket and working class democrats biden has spent his career appealing to those voters the obama campaign clearly made the decision that they did not need their veep pick to reinforce their change message and that was a smart move obama brings plenty of change and excitement on his own
7317160 was accused of plagiarism when he did not credit neil kinnock then leader of the british labor party for much of his stump speech
7317161 john quinlan a reporter for the sioux city journal said his notes showed biden said he was quoting kinnock when he used the same passage in a speech aug 14 stories in the new york times the boston globe and other newspapers also said biden had used the rhetoric and credited kinnock for it

7317174 we started this journey with a simple belief that the american people were better than their government in washington a government that has fallen prey to special interests and policies that have left working people behind
7317175 for months ive searched for a leader to finish this journey alongside me and to join in me in making washington work for the american people
7317176 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7317177 joe biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7317178 now i could stand here and recite a list of senator bidens achievements because he is one of the finest public servants of our time but first i want to talk to you about the character of the man standing next to me
7317179 joe bidens many triumphs have only come after great trial
7317180 it might be hard to believe when you hear him talk now but as a child he had a terrible stutter
7317181 tragedy tests us it tests our fortitude and it tests our faith
7317182 years later senator biden would face another brush with death when he had a brain aneurysm on the way to the hospital they didnt think he was going to make it they gave him slim odds to recover but he did he beat it and he came back stronger than before
7317183 maybe its this resilience this insistence on overcoming adversity that accounts for joe bidens work in the senate
7317184 fifteen years ago too many american communities were plagued by violence and insecurity so joe biden brought democrats and republicans together to pass the 1994 crime bill putting 100 000 cops on the streets and starting an eight year drop in crime across the country
7317185 for far too long millions of women suffered abuse in the shadows so joe biden wrote the violence against women act so every woman would have a place to turn for support the rate of domestic violence went down dramatically and countless women got a second chance at life
7317186 year after year he has been at the forefront of the fight for judges who respect the fundamental rights and liberties of the american people college tuition that is affordable for all equal pay for women and a rising minimum wage for all and family leave policies that value work and family
7317187 that same strength of character is at the core of his rise to become one of americas leading voices on national security
7317188 he looked slobodan milosevic in the eye and called him a war criminal and then helped shape policies that would end the killing in the balkans and bring him to justice
7317189 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7317190 joe wont just make a good vice president he will make a great one
7317191 thats because he is still that scrappy kid from scranton who beat the odds the dedicated family man and committed catholic who knows every conductor on that amtrak train to wilmington thats the kind of fighter who i want by my side in the months and years to come
7317192 thats what its going to take to win the fight for good jobs that let people live their dreams a tax code that rewards work instead of wealth and health care that is affordable and accessible for every american family
7317193 we know what were going to get from the other side
7317194 we cant afford more of the same i am running for president because thats a future that i dont accept for my daughters and i dont accept it for your children its time for the change that the american people need
7317195 what would you do with 50 000 tickets to the acceptance speech
7317196 life is a game except you can never play it again
7317197 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor
7317198 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead
7317199 alright team we gotta get people to watch this thing how are we gonna accomplish that
7317200 i know what if we all make funny faces every time a camera finds us
7317201 si te tienen que pagar una factura un d a determinado seguro que no te la ingresan si esperas conseguir x clientes conseguir s x 4 clientes si prev s x gastos tendr s 4x gastos
7317202 if we have somebody that has a steep backyard and they want to grow big blue stem on it because it keeps down erosion they should be able to do that but it would be above 10 inches
7317203 adsense earning impression count x click though rate x cost per click x smart pricing factor viewing your on website will not get you banned just make sure you dont click on the ads however repeatedly reload your page to jack up page impressions can get you banned click through rate ctr is ratio of clicks per impressions it can range from 0 1 to 30 but most commonly around 1 to 10
7317204 first impressions count make sure the ad unit with the highest ctr is the first ad unit in the html code of your page keep in mind that the first ad unit in the source code is not always the first ad unit that your users will see when the page finishes loading in their browser
7317205 ads placed near rich content and navigational aids usually do well because users are focused on those areas of a page on pages where users are typically focused on reading an article ads placed directly below the end of the editorial content tend to perform very well
7317206 format is important for multiple ad units display your ad units where repeat users will notice them place a leaderboard immediately after the last post
7317207 the middle above the fold location performs the best best performing ad format is the large rectangle 336 280 so the wider ad formats are doing better than the other ones and the reason is that they actually take up fewer lines and so with every additional line you have a chance of losing that interested user so the wider formats do best so specifically the top three formats are the 336 280 that you see on the page the 300 250 medium rectangle and then the 160 600 wide skyscraper we have a feature in the adsense account where you are able to multi select different color palettes that blend with your site to add some variety and freshness to the ads and that also will help decrease ad blindness
7317208 the second most active placement in terms of click throughs tends to be the right hand rail or margin
7317209 i found the most success in placing the google adsense medium rectangle either right in the middle of the page or in a middle right column as long as it has content above and below the ad unit its is fine to use adsense ads on a forum however expect a very low ctr
7317210 post adsense ads on text rich pages avoid titles like the approved sponsored links and advertisements place ads above the fold match the colors of your ads with the colour scheme of your site blend ads with your page remove the borders by having a similar color as your background
7317211 to remove public service ads psa in google adsense develop sufficient good content with keywords ensure that meta tags like title amp description and the headings tags like h1 h2 etc have content which matches the rest of your site
7317212 you can now run adsense on the same page as other contextual ad programs
7317213 google adsense policy we ask that publishers not line up images and ads in a way that suggests a relationship between the images and the ads
7317214 section targeting uses certain html tweaks to force the google adsense bot to focus on specific content section targeting is the latest and most effective addition to adsense
7317215 over the weekend i decided to change the number of ads units on my blog based upon where the traffic is coming from i have a small php function that checks to see if the referrer is a search engine and if it is i display and additional 2 ad units my adsense revenue increasing by 284 on saturday sunday and monday
7317216 never click your own adsense ads or get them clicked for whatever reason never change the adsense code do not run competitive contextual text ad 2006 or search services on the same site do not mask ad elements avoid excessive advertising and keyword stuffing
7317217 putting ads on your site wont hurt your traffic there are 6 sorts of bloggers income
7317218 a number of factors come into play when adsense tries to determine what the page is about the url of the page the page title the anchor text of links the keywords that appear most frequently within the page search engine queries that lead to the page or to another page that links to the page
7317219 ask yourself if you are willing to compromise your blogs layout and over all feel by adding ads in them look at your traffic and see if its enough to draw the crowd make good use of the ad channels give it time
7317220 you can put upto 3 adsense units on a page for short articles ctr is best when ads are placed just above the content for long articles ctr improves if ads are placed somewhere in middle of the content go wide the large rectangle 336 280 is the best paying adsense format
7317221 google adsense folks have unveiled another useful feature for adsense publishers section targeting the concept is simple but the advantages and possibilities are endless
7317222 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power thats not the way to deal in the 21st century
7317223 that is no way to do things in the 21st century
7317224 the precedent of kosovo is a terrible precedent which will de facto blow apart the whole system of international relations developed not over decades but over centuries
7317225 they have not thought through the results of what they are doing at the end of the day it is a two ended stick and the second end will come back and hit them in the face
7317226 georgians are a melodramatic people and few more so than their hyperactive president
7317227 we killed as many of them as we could but where are our friends
7317228 responsible in the name of his government for two controversial regions abkhazia and south ossetia he ignores the fact that the inhabitants of these areas do not want to be part of his country
7317229 is also how israel responded to another provocation the killing and abduction of israeli soldiers by hezbollah this is how countries including freer and more democratic ones than russia respond to provocations
7317230 israel might pay a heavy price for the drones and training by israel ziv and gal hirsch our new mercenaries in georgia
7317231 can highlight his desire to cooperate more closely with the united states on anti missile defense in order to remove the threat of blackmail which even a weak and distant army can pose to either state
7317232 prime minister netanyahu can formulate the policies and stress themes he favors in language familiar to the americans by tapping into themes of american administrations during the cold war which apply well to israel if israel wants to test certain propositions that require a benign american reaction then the best time to do so is before november 1996

7317266 after three years of study the national institute of standards and technology report on the collapse of world trade center building 7 the main conclusion is that the building came down due to fire not due to debris damage or some conspiracy demolition team the fire started pretty small after the collapse of wtc 1 but was left to burn several floors out completely the important finding is that the collapse was triggered by thermal expansion of beams which could detach asymmetrically loaded girders from the main columns some limited pancaking of floors then caused a lack of lateral support and buckling of a single column this triggered the failure of the entire core of the building which finally fell down as a single piece crackpot theories can be discussed elsewhere please limit the discussion to the science here all documents can be found at also available and yes they used beowulf clusters to do the simulations some of which lasted for several months

7317289 any time you knock down some woods you are displacing some animals
7317290 its not unusual for me to hear people talking about seeing bears
7317291 ive been hearing more bears stories in bergen county over the last few years
7317292 evidently a bear was trying to get into my neighbors garbage
7317293 they could be walking through your yard and you dont even know it
7317294 first thing this morning we let our dog out and he just took off

7317297 were happy to have nature around us but we dont want them to come too close
7317298 any time you knock down some woods you are displacing some animals
7317299 its not unusual for me to hear people talking about seeing bears
7317300 ive been hearing more bears stories in bergen county over the last few years
7317301 evidently a bear was trying to get into my neighbors garbage
7317302 they could be walking through your yard and you dont even know it

7317312 wendt u naar mij toe en wordt behouden alle gij einden der aarde want ik ben god en niemand meer
7317313 het lam gods heeft geen lust in uw dood die u weliswaar verdient maar daarin dat u zich bekeert en leve o mensen een ieder die in hem gelooft tot vergeving van zonden zal niet verderven maar eeuwig leven haast u en spoed u toch naar het kruis die man der smarten heeft gezorgd voor een weg ter ontkoming haast u om uws levens wil
7317314 laat u toch met god verzoenen heden indien gij zijn stem hoort verhardt u niet maar laat u leiden o mensen hoe zult gij ontvlieden indien ge op zon grote zaligheid geen acht geeft
7317315 meneer die nodiging is niet voor ons allemaal die is alleen voor de uitverkorenen en als we daarbij horen dan zal god ons zelf wel trekken anders heeft het echt geen zin als we ons tot god wenden
7317316 maar mensen in de bijbel staat dat god met vlammend vuur wraak zal doen over degenen die het evangelie van de heere jezus christus ongehoorzaam zijn
7317317 u moet niet denken dat u het weet onze dominee zegt dit en ik voel gewoon dat dat de zuivere waarheid is
7317318 wat wij aan het kruis horen is de uitwendige roeping zodra hij ons inwendig roept ja dan kunnen we ons laten leiden en weet u niet dat wij onszelf niet kunnen bekeren dat god dat moet doen
7317319 dat kan alleen door de werking van de heilige geest en als die gaat werken nou dan komt het allemaal vanzelf want die werkt onwederstandelijk
7317320 u heeft gelijk dat het de heilige geest is die harten wederbaart maar dat ontslaat u toch niet van uw verantwoordelijkheid om u geheel aan de heere jezus over te geven u kunt god toch straks niet verwijten dat u er niets aan kon doen dat u niet bekeerd bent omdat de heilige geest het bij u niet wilde werken trouwens weet u wel dat u het vermogen heeft om de heilige geest te wederstaan
7317321 zeg dat gaat zomaar niet wat moet ik bij het kruis doen ik moet eerst mijn zonde en onmacht echt beseffen pas dan mag ik bij het lam gods komen onze dominee waarschuwt altijd voor mensen die zomaar naar de heere jezus gaan nee eerst ellende dan pas verlossing
7317322 maar meneer het woord van god geeft aan dat u ellendig b nt of u het beseft of niet u zult uw onwaardigheid vanuit uzelf nooit volledig beseffen spoed u toch naar het kruis daar is iemand die u uw ogen voor uw ellendigheid wil openen maar die u ook wil laten zien wie hijzelf is werp toch een blik op de verlosser het is nog genadetijd

7317544 we did our best but the best was not enough
7317545 it hasnt been easy not that it was ever going to be easy but when you throw in the emotional load that the team has had to bear collectively for them to come through and be this good is a wonderful achievement
7317546 she said it first she said you won you won you won nothing else to say there just listening to each other smile on the phone
7317547 ive been blessed in so many ways i want to give back to other people
7317548 we dont want to get complacent or write it off too early
7317549 i guess my biggest concern is that very few people have the patience to wait anything out
7317550 they might say ok this is done instead of staying prepared
7317551 now you just have to imagine the room with a different color scheme hardwood floors and all these people living the street and the 6 year old shot through the head and the rest of the family acting crazy as if things could have been handled differently
7317552 of toch een mengeling die stond goedkoper ik dacht een goeie keus te maken maar de korrel is te grof

7317573 people ask if she suffered and unfortunately we know she did suffer
7317574 this is why its so tough for me and staff when we go and see a baby like this
7317575 when you die with your hands clenched thats just sad
7317576 this is the first death like this ohio and hopefully the last
7317577 when you have a death like this the whole community suffers
7317578 yeah but watchman what if they really got it coming i mean what if somebody really screwed me over and deserve what they got coming
7317579 if i ever saw him again id tell him to
7317580 i mean the team turned the page they kept going they worked incredible many many hours guys coming back from the accident to charlotte bringing the spare car back and other pieces back i mean its just to prove that everybody had a great attitude nobody was even thinking about negative ways
7317581 weve raced this car many times this year its just we didnt have it prepared to race here it had lots of old equipment on it did the edmonton race and the test out here last week so it really just came down to a lot of work for the crew guys to get the cars prepared and theyve just done a magic job i really cant feel any difference between any of our race cars
7317582 i had to take a step out and collect my thoughts and collect my emotions and come back out

7317586 for the first time in my adult life i am really proud of my country
7317587 jesse jackson won south carolina in 84 and 88 jackson ran a good campaign and obama ran a good campaign here
7317588 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
7317589 this is for my 78 year old lifelong democrat father who has already booked his ticket to fly out here in hopes of getting in
7317590 she wanted it for her mother who campaigned for kennedy and was browse a gallery of images from the dnc prepped pepsi center browse a gallery of images preparations parties and protests in advance of the convention view street closures alternative route info view street closures and protest parade route for aug 25 27 view protest parade route for thursday aug 28 wondering if id had any luck
7317591 i called all the people i knew in middle tennessee politics
7317592 no one had tickets they were sort of left out
7317593 i have worked for him so i put a little pressure there
7317594 i kept calling and they said no were blocked off for dnc week
7317595 i talked to a friend of mine who was a really good buddy of al gores and he said he was going to try to get me some way to get in the convention during the week

7317602 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7317603 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7317604 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7317605 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7317606 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7317607 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7317608 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7317609 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7317610 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7317611 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7317612 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7317613 non dir chi vince ma sono convinto che lo scudetto non si allontaner da milano
7317614 e aumentato il numero delle squadre competitive il parere di mazzone io penso che inter milan juve e roma possano lottare per il titolo ma quasi quasi ci metto pure la fiorentina che ha lavorato benissimo in sede di calciomercato e ha le carte in regola per regalare ai propri tifosi una stagione ricca di soddisfazioni complimenti a corvino e alla presidenza una volta esistevano le sette sorelle adesso sono ridotte a cinque lo scudetto per finiranno per contenderselo le milanesi e un bene che vi sia tanta competizione
7317615 le nostre squadre dice prima erano molto preparate sotto il profilo atletico e tattico adesso sono cresciute anche dal punto di vista tecnico e questa la cosa che salta allocchio lo dimostra il fatto che vedo linter leggermente favorita per lo scudetto ma dovr fare molta attenzione ai cugini rossoneri penso che il milan soprattutto senza champions league possa essere protagonista assoluto nella lotta per lo scudetto ha fatto certi investimenti e deve darsi una svegliata questanno non pu permettersi di sbagliare
7317616 we could always take you nightclubbing if you miss it
7317617 omdat dit waarschijnlijk het laatste kabinet is met minder dan 4 partijen dus het laatste stabiele kabinet niet dat ik zo blij ben met die christenfundis maar soit
7317618 stelletje oplichters dit kabinet 1 groot toneelstuk democratie betekent voor je idealen gaan staan en die verdedigen wanneer politici nog uitsluitend zeggen wat het volk wil horen en verder hun eigen gang gaan is de democratie dood
7317619 het enige probleem is dat andere systemen ook niet werken en wij ons dus maar aan de democratie vastklampen
7317620 de huidige politiek heeft de laatste tientallen jaren dit land compleet verneukt niet links niet rechts maar gewoon den haag ze hebben massaal gefaald en ze blijven falen
7317621 nationalisten graag misschien dat zij er nog iets van kunnen maken anders wordt het echt emigreren
7317622 een nationalist die naar het buitenland gaat verhuizen is nooit grappig
7317623 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7317624 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7317625 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7317626 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7317627 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7317628 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7317629 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7317630 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7317631 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7317632 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7317633 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7317634 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7317635 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7317636 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7317637 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7317638 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7317639 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7317640 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7317641 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7317642 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7317643 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7317644 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7317645 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7317646 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7317647 este verano el deporte m s peligroso es la bicicleta
7317648 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7317649 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
7317650 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7317651 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7317652 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7317653 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7317654 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7317655 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7317656 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7317657 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7317658 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7317659 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7317660 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7317661 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7317662 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7317663 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7317664 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7317665 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7317666 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7317667 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7317668 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7317669 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything

7317671 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7317672 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7317673 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7317674 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7317675 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7317676 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7317677 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7317678 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7317679 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7317680 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7317681 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7317682 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7317683 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
7317684 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7317685 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7317686 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7317687 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7317688 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7317689 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7317690 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7317691 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7317692 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7317693 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7317694 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7317695 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7317696 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7317697 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7317698 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
7317699 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7317700 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7317701 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7317702 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7317703 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7317704 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7317705 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7317706 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7317707 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7317708 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7317709 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7317710 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7317711 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7317712 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7317713 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7317714 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7317715 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7317716 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7317717 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7317718 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7317719 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7317720 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7317721 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7317722 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7317723 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
7317724 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
7317725 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
7317726 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
7317727 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
7317728 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
7317729 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
7317730 there isnt that divide where theres a couple of huge movies coming every week
7317731 thank you dark knight thats added close to half a billion dollars
7317732 one film like the dark knight can make a huge difference
7317733 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7317734 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7317735 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7317736 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7317737 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7317738 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7317739 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7317740 whether or not our next president and congress dismantle empire usa plus turning things around here at home
7317741 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7317742 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7317743 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7317744 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7317745 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7317746 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7317747 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7317748 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7317749 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7317750 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7317751 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7317752 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7317753 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7317754 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7317755 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7317756 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7317757 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7317758 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7317759 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7317760 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7317761 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7317762 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7317763 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7317764 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7317765 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7317766 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7317767 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7317768 this week barack obamas challenge is to select a running mate whos
7317769 after the 2001 terrorist strikes on the world trade center three blocks from fujimuras home his work explored the power of fire to both destroy and purify themes drawn from the christian gospels and dantes
7317770 i am also an artist and creative and what i do is driven by my faith experience
7317771 but i am also a human being living in the 21st century struggling with a lot of brokenness my own as well as the worlds i dont want to use the term christian to shield me away from the suffering or evil that i see or to escape in some nice ghetto where everyone thinks the same
7317772 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7317773 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7317774 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7317775 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7317776 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7317777 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7317778 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7317779 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7317780 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7317781 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7317782 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7317783 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7317784 secondly do you want to live in a one party state because i have a few suggestions if so
7317785 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7317786 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7317787 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7317788 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7317789 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7317790 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7317791 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7317792 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7317793 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7317794 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7317795 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7317796 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7317797 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7317798 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7317799 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7317800 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7317801 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7317802 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7317803 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7317804 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7317805 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7317806 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7317807 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7317808 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7317809 right now more than ever we just cant afford insert here
7317810 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7317811 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7317812 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7317813 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7317814 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7317815 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7317816 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7317817 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7317818 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7317819 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7317820 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7317821 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7317822 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7317823 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7317824 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7317825 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7317826 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7317827 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7317828 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7317829 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7317830 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7317831 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7317832 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7317833 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7317834 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7317835 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7317836 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7317837 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7317838 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7317839 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7317840 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7317841 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7317842 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7317843 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7317844 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7317845 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7317846 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7317847 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7317848 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7317849 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7317850 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7317851 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7317852 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7317853 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7317854 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7317855 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7317856 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7317857 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7317858 detached alaskans promoting an unusual mixture of emotion and a smattering of science within the context of a scrambled worldview
7317859 during july and early august caribou can be seen violently shaking their heads stamping their feet and racing wildly over the tundra for no apparent reason they are seeking to evade warble or bot flies
7317860 the bill permits the board of game to allow a predator program for wolves and grizzly bears if the commissioner of fish and game finds an emergency where wolves or grizzly bears in an area are causing a decline in prey
7317861 i was very sad to hear of ms matthews passing she was a tremendous assest to the board and she will be missed greatly
7317862 ms matthews was a strong advocate for doing what was right for all students she will be remembered as a champion for children
7317863 the only reason im doing this is to get money to get enough heroin to kill myself with
7317864 just hold it stay there just wait for me ok

7317883 last year at the all city competition he kexin moved from one team to another and during the process of registering during the move there appeared this age discrepancy
7317884 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7317885 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7317886 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7317887 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that
7317888 they have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be ok
7317889 the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7317890 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant

7317913 young people who were told that it was all their own fault that they had no future no matter how hard they worked have begun to think that its a question of political responsibility and that they must change politics the health care reform separating people aged 75 and older from the rest of the population pushing them into a separate insurance system shifting more costs onto them and cutting services for them ed made the elderly think is this the reward for our sacrifices for the nation all these years and they are now looking to our party
7317914 the person who i believe will be the next and one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states joe biden
7317915 mostly i think what attracted senator obama was bidens wisdom
7317916 and not the kind of wisdom you get in washington dc but the kind of wisdom you get when you overcome adversity tragedy in your life as he has
7317917 he understands whats going on in this economy he doesnt believe as john mccain does that things are fundamentally sound and weve made great progress when people are losing ground all the time
7317918 i think barack obama did exactly what he said he was going to do he picked someone who complements him
7317919 he picks someone who is of his own mind and will not be a sycophant and picked someone who is knowledgeable in the ways of washington because if barack obama wants to effect change part of doing that is having somebody with you that knows the institutions that you are changing
7317920 great retail campaigner who really connects with people on a visceral level
7317921 they can run any attack ad they want but heres the issue americans want a change in the direction of this nation and especially the economy has come into the fore
7317922 joe is a guy who grew up in a working class household in scranton pennsylvania really understands what it is to have to scrap barack is a guy who comes from no means and no connections mother on food stamps when he was a kid
7317923 this week we saw a sharp distinction as these two candidates understand the plight of normal americans and john mccain cant remember how many houses he owns
7317924 if you can see where people are coming from or going to the citys patterns of movements over years you can figure out where to put ads for which target group or how to measure the impact of outdoor advertising for example
7317925 there remains a limit to the available talent that can be hired to pursue the rapid increase in interactive marketing communications programs that customers are demanding
7317926 in order to meet that need agency holding companies and other marketing communications businesses are going to have to acquire businesses agencies that possess those skills
7317927 youd have to believe its a bit of an ugly thing for microsoft to sell at that price not that they cant withstand it
7317928 and if thats the case the idea of an asset swap might be useful to mask some of the value questions
7317929 wpp as a whole has a whole lot of bargaining power if creative minds got together

7317940 this is one bread and butter issue that no one can ignore
7317941 it s a growing concern and it s clearly one of the largest concerns people have
7317942 what we are experiencing is a demand shock coming from a new category of participant in the commodities futures markets
7317943 for 150 years people who are not commercial traders had no business being in the futures markets
7317944 to my sense there has to be a clear distinction between those who can legitimately trade and those who should not be trading
7317945 let s not make any accusations until we have some information
7317946 if there is found to be some forces other than market forces at work let s have a discussion about that but let s not put the cart before the horse

7317967 what you need to realize when you make issue of whether obama would allow abortions is that any president will have to allow abortions but to pin down a president is what the media does obama and mccain will have to allow abortions but it might be awkward for obama to admit that openly and earn the wrath of the religiosities about to vote think if you were about to get a job and an interviewer asked you if you had ever feigned illness to get off work for the day you would have a choice of lying and hoping to get the job and telling the truth and losing it you should denigrate the question but you choose to denigrate the questioned your bad in my opinion as you encourage the worst in people and you deserve the phony that you encourage at the same time this to barbara and all the rest who want to make it a reason for not electing a president
7317968 if jessica s law protects just one child from sexual abuse it is worth it

7317974 i want to know what makes my little nephew tick
7317975 in the last four years or five years we used movies in our experiments
7317976 but we used movies basically to understand about the brain
7317977 you can think about it as control by the director
7317978 hitchcock managed to take each main area and cause it to respond in a similar way so he basically controlled whats going on in the brain
7317979 you can think of it as real life or the most boring movie ever
7317980 they like to leave things open ended and ambiguous for different kinds of feelings so if director sees a strong correlation maybe he or she thinks they failed
7317981 but then if you think about other movies they dont leave anything open they want to control as much of the brain as possible
7317982 you can go to the area that processes the soundtrack see any correlations and then go to the lighting and then the plot and so forth
7317983 were up on the research aspects of fmri but we decided that its not a viable technology for neuromarketing
7317984 we bring people into the laboratory depending on whichever demographic a company wants examined
7317985 we show them material we wire them up we put electrodes on their head and we precisely measure where their eyes are looking their galvanic skin response and their heart rate
7317986 if were analyzing a two hour movie we can extract the most salient parts for a trailer automatically
7317987 the most salient parts fit together into a very nice story
7317988 when people are consuming an experience together theres a form of emotional contagion
7317989 the next thing is were building a small movie theater
7317990 the crowd effect is going to be important for certain things were definitely moving in that direction
7317991 with the market and the companies that approached me the clients simply dont care if its reliable or not
7317992 no one cares because its a sticker on the product
7317993 people we work with keep asking us to look at things at an earlier creative stage
7317994 we never tested whether we can tell if a movie will succeed in the box office and whether theres a strong correlation or not but maybe thats the case
7317995 but only on the condition that they lease it for 20 years just to make sure that theyre serious
7317996 the issue of interagency agreements is being discussed with officials in the four federal agencies

7318009 w hrend des rennens schienen sie auf den longruns etwas mehr geschwindigkeit zu zeigen wir blieben im ersten abschnitt des rennens ganz gut an ihnen dran gegen ende des rennens fuhren sie uns jedoch etwas davon ich war jedoch wirklich gl cklich ber die geschwindigkeit meines autos und sie gaben mir drei runden mehr benzin
7318010 es war pech da ich so knapp bei felipe wieder auf die strecke zur ck kam wenn wir vielleicht in derselben runde an die box gekommen w ren wie er dann w re ich ihm vielleicht n her gekommen oder h tte die chance gehabt gegen ihn zu k mpfen
7318011 aber dies ist rennsport und die gro artige sache ist dass wir f r mich selbst und f r das team einige punkte geholt haben gro artig ist dass wir gezeigt haben dass wir ber eine gute zuverl ssigkeit verf gen und dies haben wir dem team zu verdanken das fantastische arbeit leistet
7318012 du hast erw hnt dass du an diesem wochenende durch ein gesundheitliches problem behindert wurdest kannst du uns genau sagen was das problem war
7318013 ja ich hatte wirklich ein ziemlich miserables wochenende als ich ankam hatte ich die grippe hatte an fast jedem tag ziemlich starkes fieber und wenig energie ich hatte zudem ein problem mit spasmus in meinem nacken was beinahe dazu f hrte dass ich dieses wochenende nicht gefahren w re
7318014 wie war es auf der strecke gegen ende des rennens zu fahren
7318015 ich habe es wirklich genossen die leute haben hier fantastische arbeit geleistet um den kurs vorzubereiten das wetter war gro artig die atmosph re war ph nomenal die spanischen leute waren gro artig auch die streckenposten haben fantastische arbeit geleistet um die autos von der strecke zu bekommen die von ihr abkamen
7318016 sie sind wom glich die schnellsten die ich in meiner gesamten karriere gesehen habe diesbez glich war ich sehr beeindruckt auf der strecke zu fahren war generell sehr gut die strecke war sehr sicher es ist schwierig zu berholen aber das ist die formel 1 ich bin also gl cklich
7318017 du hast in silverstone und hockenheim gewonnen fantastische siege und dann in ungarn hier zeigte ferrari eine sehr sehr gute geschwindigkeit vor allem im rennen denkst du dass ihr nun mehr oder weniger auf demselben niveau seid denn es schien so zu sein als w rst du in den beiden rennen die du gewonnen hast etwas schneller gewesen
7318018 meiner meinung nach ist es ziemlich ausgeglichen wenn man sich das gesamte feld anschaut dann scheinen in der qualifikation alle relativ eng beieinander zu liegen das bessere auto tendiert dazu besser mit den reifen umzugehen und hat bessere longruns meiner meinung nach liegen wir ziemlich eng beieinander vielleicht sind sie w hrend des rennens ein wenig besser aber in der qualifikation sind wir ziemlich nah dran
7318019 war die seite der startaufstellung heute ein nachteil w re es eine andere angelegenheit gewesen wenn die seite so gewesen w re wie dies urspr nglich geplant war
7318020 ich glaube nicht dass dies allzu sehr ein nachteil war mit sicherheit schienen alle auf der rechten seite einen besseren start gehabt zu haben ich bemerkte w hrend des rennens dass ich tats chlich auf dieser seite fahre die ganze zeit ber auf der pole position seite der startaufstellung es muss also die sauberere seite gewesen sein so sah es auch aus denn am start bekamen felipe und heikki die besseren starts hin
7318021 gegen massa wurde nach dem man ver in der boxengasse ermittelt glaubst du dass du von der rennleitung den sieg bekommst
7318022 wir befinden uns nun im zweiten drittel der saison es sind noch sechs rennen um den titel du hast gesagt dass die konstanz der schl ssel ist aber vielleicht ist die zuverl ssigkeit sogar noch entscheidender besonders f r felipe und ferrari wenn man die situation mit den motoren bedenkt
7318023 wie man sehen kann ist die zuverl ssigkeit der schl ssel und es muss f r alle das ziel sein ins ziel zu kommen und punkte zu holen ich mache mir ber die zuverl ssigkeit meines autos keine sorgen das kann ich dir sagen in den vergangenen anderthalb jahren hatten wir eine ph nomenale zuverl ssigkeit dies ist nat rlich dem gesamten team zu verdanken welches das gesamte paket auf die beine gestellt hat
7318024 ongoing efforts to create positive and lasting peace in the region and progress toward the shared goal of a peace agreement in 2008
7318025 there isnt that divide where theres a couple of huge movies coming every week
7318026 thank you dark knight thats added close to half a billion dollars
7318027 one film like the dark knight can make a huge difference
7318028 when youre putting wheat on the ground theres going to be a loss
7318029 they dont ever like to put it on the ground but when wheat is 7 8 or 10 a bushel they sure dont like to put it on the ground
7318030 were way way behind in our infrastructure investment both in the private sector and publicly
7318031 and we need to move a lot on that or we will see other countries supplant us as they get greater investment in their infrastructure
7318032 two or three dollars a ton is the difference between getting a contract or not
7318033 all of the sudden grains are starting to have to pave their own way

7318037 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7318038 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7318039 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7318040 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7318041 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7318042 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7318043 i was keeping goods there and they didnt let me bring them out i lost about 850 000 dollars and they even used 7 000 boxes of cheese for protection on the roof
7318044 the work has improved the markets have opened iraqi traders are dealing with other companies directly
7318045 i left the country because of the violence but now that it is more secure i will return to live in baghdad at the end of this month
7318046 it is the first time in six conferences we are talking about actual projects before we were always discussing terrorism and sectarianism
7318047 we are at the beginning we would like to establish the good basics to start and actually there are some plans started but there are still few
7318048 we have very big strategic plans in iraq which include electricity and oil and the refineries and also other factories which will bring good benefits to iraq
7318049 we hope to tap the roughly 4 million u s hispanic households with analog boxes that will eventually convert to digital
7318050 ongoing efforts to create positive and lasting peace in the region and progress toward the shared goal of a peace agreement in 2008
7318051 we have seen in the last few weeks the price of rice which has become their staple food just keeps going up and there is no guarantee this will stop any time soon unless the government takes remedial action immediately
7318052 this money i suggest very strongly should be used to provide some sort of relief however temporary on the price of rice
7318053 the person who i believe will be the next and one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states joe biden
7318054 mostly i think what attracted senator obama was bidens wisdom
7318055 and not the kind of wisdom you get in washington dc but the kind of wisdom you get when you overcome adversity tragedy in your life as he has
7318056 he understands whats going on in this economy he doesnt believe as john mccain does that things are fundamentally sound and weve made great progress when people are losing ground all the time
7318057 i think barack obama did exactly what he said he was going to do he picked someone who complements him
7318058 he picks someone who is of his own mind and will not be a sycophant and picked someone who is knowledgeable in the ways of washington because if barack obama wants to effect change part of doing that is having somebody with you that knows the institutions that you are changing
7318059 great retail campaigner who really connects with people on a visceral level
7318060 they can run any attack ad they want but heres the issue americans want a change in the direction of this nation and especially the economy has come into the fore
7318061 joe is a guy who grew up in a working class household in scranton pennsylvania really understands what it is to have to scrap barack is a guy who comes from no means and no connections mother on food stamps when he was a kid
7318062 this week we saw a sharp distinction as these two candidates understand the plight of normal americans and john mccain cant remember how many houses he owns
7318063 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7318064 of course its possible to prepare a forecast with any lead time you like whether or nor that forecast has any accuracy or usable skill is another question
7318065 ill kind of be the elephant in the room but it really says something about how far senator obama is reaching out
7318066 we are expanding the agenda of whats pro life when you consider poverty environmentalism and war those are the issues that are being addressed by the democratic party
7318067 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever

7318080 two or three dollars a ton is the difference between getting a contract or not
7318081 all of the sudden grains are starting to have to pave their own way
7318082 what was the early childhood of obama in hawaii in kenya in indonesia when he was adopted and later back to hawaii
7318083 the validity obamas birth certificate has been confirmed by state of hawaii us state dept us senate state of illinois etc so the state of hawaii which confirmed his birth is in on the scam so us state dept which issued his passport is in on the scam so state of illinois which issued his drivers license is in on the scam so us senate which confirmed his citizenzip is in on this scam so cook couny which confirmed his identity is in on the scam there are so many in on the scam so you people must be very bright to see through all those scams and you can actually vote these people are slighty dumber than an idiot
7318084 for in six days the lord made the heavens and the earth the sea and all that is in them and rested the seventh day
7318085 all things were made through him and without him nothing was made that was made
7318086 look at the behemoth which i made along with you and which feed on grass like an ox what strength he has in his loins what power in the muscles of his belly his tail sways like a cedar the sinews of his thighs are close knit his bones are tubes of bronze his limbs like rods of iron he ranks first among the works of god
7318087 he comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships
7318088 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7318089 oh and were also left holding the bag on two cats
7318090 i guess my point was ultimately that being gay or straight is like being right handed or left handed to me it really doesnt bother me at all
7318091 i must really disagree i believe that aquinas was right when he said that live begins at quickening
7318092 youre both wrong life begins when the kids move out and the cats die

7318099 when youre building a car no matter what you do you have someones life in your hands
7318100 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7318101 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7318102 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7318103 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7318104 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7318105 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7318106 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7318107 the first is out of the way and i seem to have done that
7318108 there are only two picks so its a tight situation but im going to have to win in scotland to give myself a chance
7318109 as everybody knows its about winning i have no complaints i have not played well enough but theres one more event and ill certainly be giving it 101 percent
7318110 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7318111 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7318112 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7318113 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7318114 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7318115 but i was feeling so bad if shed told me to bury a tin can and run around the house three times i would have
7318116 i just wanted to know that id done everything i could to reduce my exposure
7318117 to enable our members to continue to develop and sell the safe quality and innovative cosmetic and personal care products that help consumers live better healthier lives
7318118 you know youre sharing a glass of wine and its like im taking this lip gloss
7318119 then a friend said look i have two kids and i dont have time to read labels
7318120 if you have a vat of uranium and throw in an organic flower you still have a vat of uranium
7318121 im a single mom raising kids raising daughters so im too busy to read labels every single day
7318122 but you cant put a price tag on peace of mind
7318123 and i do feel better although maybe its mental its totally about education and making the wiser choice
7318124 some people will say i will change lotions but i will never give up my mascara and thats ok
7318125 ultimately everyone has to work together to make things better so you cant throw them under the bus
7318126 i will commit to this team until i cant walk no more
7318127 to win another one lisa leslie got four and she wore all four to the game tonight i want to catch lisa i want to catch michael phelps
7318128 im just so excited about how many want to go forward
7318129 i know we have a lot of great young talent in the nba that will probably be on the 2012 team im more than committed to being on this team again
7318130 i look back at 2004 and im so proud right now
7318131 that person will have a structure that jerry and all these people have built
7318132 i think the greatest part of the continuity should be jerry and the players the ones who still feel like they can give that type of commitment
7318133 the young guys coming up that want to be a part of this make sure you have right mindset
7318134 thats be unselfish with everything its not about you shining its about the team shining
7318135 they had a bad start before they left for athens in 2004 but with lebron and those guys coming back for this and telling everyone how cool it is its going to be a hot ticket theres going to be a lot of competition to play for this team
7318136 now the world stage is going to be lifted because the world sees we are taking everything seriously
7318137 so that playing for the united states in the olympics becomes the thing they really want to do
7318138 im warning you now you should know and how that i burn through love as easy as you adding two plus two
7318139 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why
7318140 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old
7318141 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength it is quite clear that the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton
7318142 she had 50 percent of the democratic vote in the primaries obama had 50 percent of the democratic vote
7318143 the capture of abu tiba and abu uthman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the aqi al qaeda in iraq network
7318144 whilst the intervention of coalition navies has helped in isolated cases it is by no means a long term solution it is clear that the threat or presence of coalition navies has done little to stem the tide of attacks in this region
7318145 the official alberta mortgage brokers associations position regarding the federal governments new mortgage restrictions is that the market should be allowed to function on its own with very limited government involvement
7318146 how does that work if your property drops in value say 10 and your investment makes 5 and you are paying 6 5 on the loan which goes up to 8 theres better ways to die broke
7318147 if trained economists cant agree on where interest rates are going how could the average consumer do so
7318148 we think the downside risks to canadian growth are mounting and the pressures on inflation are ebbing gradually and that should give the bank of canada room to cut by half a point
7318149 a weaker cad removes an important factor that had helped keep canadian inflationary pressures under control with monetary policy already stimulative the bank of canada is unlikely to corroborate market expectations of at least one rate cut by year end
7318150 the bond market isnt fully braced for what lies beyond that in 2009 a fairly aggressive rate hike cycle that will be needed to ward off the spillover from food energy prices into core inflation
7318151 today prime has flattened and is poised to go up its simply a matter of not if but when and how much so now might be a good time to look at locking in
7318152 assuming commodity prices stabilize around where they are or at somewhat lower levels the peak headline inflation numbers should begin to look a little bit better next year
7318153 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women
7318154 on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
7318155 emotional stress is highly subjective and is difficult to measure accurately
7318156 women in this study were interviewed after breast cancer was diagnosed when they may be more likely to recall feeling depression and anxiety
7318157 the researchers also didnt account for other factors known to affect breast cancer risk such as family history or weight
7318158 breast cancer is a complex disease and there is unlikely to be one single cause
7318159 he expressed a desire to go back to russia for personal reasons and i respect that
7318160 we didnt want this to develop into a situation in september so we placed him on waivers now and this will allow him to go play there
7318161 james mirtle is good enough to challenge eric at off wing as the best hockey blogger out there
7318162 his performance during this years trade deadline became its own tribe in brazil
7318163 one of my favorite spots on the internet is mirtles site i wont lie guy knows his stuff and is an excellent writer
7318164 mirtle looks like the kind of guy who would like to take you out to a nice dinner and talk hockey to you all night long
7318165 james mirtle is battling off wing for the title of
7318166 james mirtle bats out one heck of a hockey blog
7318167 want to know what sports blogging can look like when its in the hands of a real journalist
7318168 when youre putting wheat on the ground theres going to be a loss
7318169 they dont ever like to put it on the ground but when wheat is 7 8 or 10 a bushel they sure dont like to put it on the ground
7318170 were way way behind in our infrastructure investment both in the private sector and publicly

7318176 only if they have to check facts presented by someone they genuinely dislike and only in the 5 minutes when the subject is hot

7318180 an quantitative increase in order of magnitude needs an qualitative increase in order of magnitude
7318181 i want to be a teacher when i grow up just like you
7318182 the real problem is not too few teachers entering the profession it is too many leaving
7318183 the kids were wonderful to be with but the stress of everything that went with it and the low pay did not make it hard to leave
7318184 its sad because you see a lot of the teachers that are young and gung ho are ready to leave
7318185 sabrina walasek loved teaching middle school science and math in daly city and felton near santa cruz but after six years the oakland resident found herself worn out from keeping kids in check the amount of energy spent on discipline and behavior management just got to me after a while
7318186 according to a national center for education statistics nces survey of 8 400 public and private school teachers the main reasons for high teacher turnover and attrition rates are inadequate administrative support 38 percent and workplace conditions 32 percent
7318187 the standardized tests dont affect the students grades but for administrators the results can destroy careers
7318188 according to the national commission on teaching and americas future 2 million teachers will leave their jobs within the next decade

7318199 people who send their money are as guilty as those who are asking them to send the money
7318200 never pay anything upfront for any reason never extend credit for any reason never do anything until their check clears never expect any help from the nigerian government never rely on your government to bail you out
7318201 sometimes victims are tricked into thinking theyll eventually be paid back and continue to participate in this endless cycle of sending money especially if the scammer is wooing them romantically which happens more commonly than one might think to both men and women
7318202 i have been teasing nigerian conmen for some time now writing as a variety of characters a large part of the fun is creating false documents to embellish my stories after all that is what the nigerians do but i generally resist the urge to stamp genuine

7318218 this week we saw a sharp distinction as these two candidates understand the plight of normal americans and john mccain cant remember how many houses he owns
7318219 its going to be very different from the opening ceremony which was burdened with heavy responsibility to show chinese culture to the world
7318220 im pleased about the declaration and grateful to president bush

7318229 i consider it the most difficult job i ever had
7318230 youve had so many varying actors pulling on the school system with such strength that ultimately it went nowhere
7318231 anyone who raises concern is labeled as being for the status quo
7318232 its the fad of the month the flavor of the year
7318233 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7318234 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region

7318302 do not think that this year is your last year as head of the government no act as if you will stay in charge for five years

7318307 if part of this plan fuels inflation a way must be found to prevent this or control any negative aspects

7318327 he has been preoccupied with escaping the shadow of his father and establishing his own image and identity in the eyes of others
7318328 he feels his experiences and performance as a p o w have finally permitted this to happen
7318329 what is true is that a number of p o w s in those first few years after their release often acted erratically their lives pockmarked by drastic mood swings and uncharacteristic behavior before achieving a more mellow equilibrium
7318330 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous

7318341 one must remember that 70 per cent of the country s population resides in the rural areas a hike in food prices will eventually help in alleviating poverty and improve the condition of the poor over the next three to five years

7318343 if you go back 12 months brand china was in tremendous difficulties with toxic toys and a number of other issues
7318344 china s amazing haul of gold medals has mirrored its spectacular economic growth to signal to the world that china has truly arrived
7318345 from the grandeur of the opening ceremony to the self assured way chinese athletes expected to win in so many events china exceeded every expectation
7318346 companies like li ning that are looking to expand globally are going to use the olympics as a chance to do that
7318347 it won t do much to lift growth as the chinese economy is so huge

7318349 the power sector has attracted a huge investment planned by various companies which include tata power sterlite industries jindal india thermal power lanco group etc it contributed a share of 18 64 per cent in the total capital expenditure
7318350 rising income levels and the growing middle class has also generated massive demand in the real estate sector the sector ranked second in terms of the flow of funds at rs 1 51 084 crore for the next two to five years
7318351 the steel sector announced investment worth of rs 1 08 609 crore in the first six months
7318352 set aside that obama said shed be on anybodys short list set aside anybodys feelings on whether she was deliberately snubbed and the pros and cons of whether it should be her focus on the politics of it and you have about a quarter of clinton loyalists still not joining the caravan for gods sake not to even make a show of taking her seriously is flatly stupid
7318353 they thought her supporters were mad before they are really mad now we knew it was never going to happen but you would have thought they might at least make a show of it
7318354 i think there are a lot of hillary voters who are going to say hey wait a minute man you said you were going to put her on the short list you know you didnt even vet her you didnt call her you didnt seek her advice by the way he didnt seek president clintons advice either hes actually the guy who i think picked the best vice president in american history you would think maybe you would sort of check in with him

7318356 not only has former gop assemblyman dean andal turned in several sub par fundraising quarters in a row but he has also spent a lot of the last month on the defensive answering questions about his role as a consultant for a community college development project
7318357 is facing increasing scrutiny over his role in a botched construction project at a community college
7318358 a prominent state senator mike machado late last week called on the california state controller s office to conduct an audit of the san joaquin delta college board of trustees after the board allegedly misappropriated 250 million in government backed bond funds set aside for the reconstruction of the community college campus
7318359 democratic strategists have suggested that internal polls show andal s support dropping since the community college story has received wide circulation in the district and have promised that andal s role in the controversy is certain to be fodder for political ads later in the fall
7318360 our approach is different we had land and some of it was belonged to the government we had the support of the trinamool congress we counselled the people and took decisions along with them
7318361 one has to understand the ground rules agricultural land should be left alone and the government should come with a policy document stressing the need to make landowners the stakeholders in the project
7318362 we have short listed around six to seven companies but we are not in a hurry to close a deal we will evaluate all options carefully since it involves a tactical entry into a new geography for us
7318363 we also intend to set up a centre in latin america which would be a nearshore centre for the us
7318364 wir haben sehr gut begonnen wir haben druck und ein schnelles tor gemacht der zwischenfall mit koch hat uns etwas aus der bahn geworfen der sieg geht vollkommen in ordnung wir haben spielerisch und vor allem k mpferisch eine sehr starke leistung gebracht den sieg wollten wir den fans schenken
7318365 ich bin sehr froh tore in diesem derby erzielt zu haben alles ist perfekt jeder hat gesehen dass wir das bessere team waren im moment sind wir das beste team jedes spiel ist unser level h her geworden
7318366 ich habe nicht mitbekommen was vorgefallen war ich hoffe das er koch anm nichts schlimmes hat solche szenen haben am fu ballplatz nichts verloren es ist relativ schnell gegangen es was war nicht viel zeit zu berlegen
7318367 es war ein letztendlich verdienter sieg rapids rapid war gut und wir haben zu wenig dagegengehalten erst als wir uns etwas befreien konnten haben wir gemerkt dass rapid probleme haben k nnte das haben wir speziell nach der pause gemacht aber dann ist der schwere fehler von bak anm gekommen das war der zeitpunkt wo wir nicht mehr richtig an den sieg gelaubt haben ich bin nicht so unzufrieden wie es das resultat erscheinen lassen k nnte die erste halbe stunde muss ich vergessen aber ich glaube wir h tten es geschafft mit dem zweiten tor war es aber vorbei
7318368 das tut mir sehr leid ich hoffe es geht ihm gut ich habe noch bei der pressekonferenz zur m igung aufgerufen leider k nnen wir solche dinge nicht beeinflussen
7318369 wir haben eigene ordner mitgehabt aber es gibt leider immer wieder chaoten die die austria fans auf die negative seite ziehen das werden wir nicht tolerieren

7318374 while my hair was styled for the ceremony i thought of ways to set fire to my wedding dress
7318375 when i protested my dad gagged me and tied me up after the wedding i tried to kill myself twice
7318376 early marriages are universal in yemen because of the cultural premium placed on shaping a young bride to meet the husbands needs
7318377 tribal leaders and imams have more influence than the state but its important to amend our marriage laws to create a benchmark we need a new place to start from
7318378 theres an avalanche of factors working against the girl child we should be on a war footing to save young girls from the inferno of child marriage
7318379 even powerful families arrange alliance marriages by bartering their daughters into the power structures at an early age but girls from the poorest families are most at risk
7318380 the cards are stacked against the girl child and those shuffling the cards dont even understand the risks to their sisters and daughters
7318381 we have to establish a trust to look after the girls interests over the next few years we need to find a model that will work for all victims of early marriage
7318382 my dad said hell kill me for defying him but i want to go back to school im too young for the responsibility of marriage

7318389 it is a deal to reduce greenhouse gases that cause dangerous climate change major polluters can now buy carbon credits that allow them to pay someone else to reduce emissions instead of cutting their own pollution

7318392 it is good to have an end to journey towards but it is the journey that matters in the end
7318393 keep your feet on the ground now and keep reaching for the stars your dreams and goals
7318394 its a blindingly obvious conflict of interest and frighteningly its one that conceivably could drag the united states into yet another war in that unstable part of the world
7318395 el nivel del torneo es muy bueno me atrevo a decir que es el mejor que se realiza en latinoam rica

7318399 the just announced formation of the coalition to bring a space shuttle orbiter home is a necessary next step in making this mission successful
7318400 competition is already fierce among several cities wanting the few available orbiters
7318401 to bring the shuttle home to palmdale we will need a multi disciplinary team with expertise in every phase of business aerospace and museum development i urge support for the work of dr susan miller of the aerospace institute who is formally tasked with moving the effort forward
7318402 members of my legislative and district staff have been closely involved in helping the various organizations working to bring a shuttle orbiter home and i am keenly aware of the obstacles to be overcome in a very short time however i believe that by working together on a valley wide base all of those obstacles can be overcome
7318403 having a space shuttle orbiter will enhance the valleys already impressive collection of aerospace vehicles

7318405 the whole world is waiting for you to do what your government will not stop the criminal bush program
7318406 im pleased about the declaration and grateful to president bush
7318407 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7318408 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7318409 working families are finding it harder and harder to makes ends meet skyrocketing costs stagnating wages increasing unemployment and attacks on our retirement security are just a few of the issues we are facing
7318410 but this fall we can do something about it all union members and community supporters are asked to join the southeast minnesota area labor council for these rallies and exciting speeches about what our community can do
7318411 i believe that we have got to start engaging in diplomacy and that is what i would do beginning now if i were president
7318412 ooh i don take physics now im only studying bio and chem oh i know ask her points at angie she studies physics
7318413 what i mean is i study physics but i don study physics
7318414 oh then nvm lar ill find another one for you erm you want normal or senior stylist

7318419 made himself a multi millionaire after he entered public life
7318420 i believe that we have got to start engaging in diplomacy and that is what i would do beginning now if i were president
7318421 and if our president does not end our involvement in iraq when i am president i will
7318422 we have bad options and worse options the best option i believe is to make certain that we begin a phased redeployment that we are as careful getting out as we were careless getting in
7318423 if i were president today i would withdraw all our forces before the end of this calendar year
7318424 but where i differentiate with the other candidates is i leave no residual forces
7318425 i would get sunni and the shia leadership engaged in serious discussions to see if they can reach some kind of political solution political reconciliation
7318426 because without that there is never going to be peace in iraq
7318427 and we need a president who can defend our country but also who knows when war is wrong and is ready to say so when it counts not four years later not five years later
7318428 there is one person who i think has the greatest chance if you figure the odds of all 18 candidates both republicans and democrats there is one candidate if you had to pick one who has the best chance to be president i think it is hillary clinton the senator from new york
7318429 she is ahead and she has been ahead and she stays ahead without much change
7318430 there is no question that mrs clinton is very very popular among democrats but she still has a high number of negatives in the quinnipiac poll and in everybodys polls
7318431 look at me im pushing through the crowd at random

7318443 new houses and better houses we give the community something we can be proud of

7318458 when the mayor of london accepts the olympic flag on august 24 the eyes of the world will turn to london and the uk as the next summer host city
7318459 it is a very important and exciting moment for us and we want as many people as possible to join in the handover celebrations
7318460 we are delighted that so many local authorities share our excitement and are proudly displaying the olympic handover flag to mark this very special moment on our journey to 2012

7318471 were calling this a celebration and ive been asked if we should really be celebrating something so aw ful
7318472 were not celebrating the flood itself were celebrating what happened afterward what happened as a community and the progress we made

7318474 youre a brown because mummy and daddy were married before we had you
7318475 dont take them on girl you belong to this world no country is large enough for you
7318476 it was the europeans who came over here and murdered all the buffalo so that the native americans would starve
7318477 they are a people of great culture and this land originally belonged to them
7318478 yes i am sure there are probably many of you in here with native american blood in fact many of your ancestors fought alongside these brave people against the europeans so you should be very proud
7318479 so although you might only read about certain kinds of greatness in your school books
7318480 remember that there are many other kinds of greatness as well and many of them look like you
7318481 you know kids human beings can be really mean to each other but no matter what you have to remember the beauty
7318482 dont forget children stereotyping is not good you can not guess how someone is going to be based on their appearance when people make generalizations it hurts individuals
7318483 tenemos que ser pacientes yo apuesto por cuba y por el futuro de cuba por eso estoy aqu estamos simplemente esperando
7318484 at this stage we are not going for the extensive research work and then again going to the icc for bradmans record runs
7318485 sincere and serious efforts put in by the australian sports statistician charles davis for finding out the mistakes in the scores of various tests don bradmans tests in particular must be a very painstaking and laborious job and hence he needs to be complimented for his research just from the point of view of setting the house of the game of cricket in its proper shape and order
7318486 in good old days the scoring methods were not absolutely foolproof and with the advancing technology perhaps such mistakes whenever detected should be set right
7318487 all of our shipping centres are resuming normal operations after experiencing three days of significant issues
7318488 weve done our internal diagnosis of course but were not going to get into it publicly we worked on it feverishly and we informed all our members
7318489 rest assured that we are taking aggressive steps to fully understand the root cause of this weeks problems and safeguard against issues like these in the future
7318490 the issues weve faced over the last several days have been significant and theres no guarantee at this point that our shipping operations will be fully restored by tomorrow
7318491 well again be working throughout the night and will update you in the morning thanks for now and continued apologies
7318492 the us led economic downturn shows no sign of causing a recession in it spending
7318493 in subsequent years we will see reduced growth but the fundamentals remain strong emerging regions replacement of obsolete systems and some technology shifts are driving growth
7318494 enterprises are switching from company owned hardware and software assets to per use service based models this will impact the industry in various ways
7318495 the projected shift to cloud computing for example will result in dramatic growth in it products in some areas and in significant reductions in other areas he added that assets in general will be utilised with greater efficiency and the overall effect on market growth will be neutral
7318496 most companies updated their software systems during the period 1997 through 2001 so we are in the middle of an upgrade cycle that should extend past the end of this decade
7318497 however the replacement of systems doesnt automatically equate to new software market growth
7318498 legacy telecom services have a dampening effect on sector growth and therefore on the overall it market
7318499 the dominant size of the telecom services market guarantees that even with the forecast for relatively slow growth it will still comprise over 44 of the it market in five years time
7318500 i didnt remember much of it but i remembered the concept and i wanted to build something like that
7318501 without my art skills it would have been difficult to build a game like chopper
7318502 i kept getting calls from one particular classroom in an outlying school
7318503 the children were having trouble getting the computers to respond to the mice
7318504 sure enough the mice were erratic unless i covered them completely with my hand blocking the direct sunlight
7318505 the excessive light was confusing the photoelectric sensors that translate the x y motion but only on sunny days or if they didnt have the blinds closed
7318506 i took the mice disassembled them and coated the inside of the beige plastic with black paint that fixed the problem and we have since replaced the mice with black plastic ones to avoid future calls
7318507 i set up a holiday rule where a reply is automatically sent out when i receive something
7318508 now that im back from holiday i cant get it to stop sending out the automatic reply i deleted all my rules and its still doing it can you please help
7318509 i did not get a response back from my test email so i assume your vacation rule is fixed if not please contact the helpdesk again
7318510 her reply when i send myself an email i get a reply
7318511 the deal for me is the republicans have to be voted out end of story
7318512 we fear however that an administrative detention order will be issued by state security investigations in violation of the public prosecution offices release order this is an extremely common practice in egypt
7318513 bayyoumys administrative detention and prior to this his detention in custody during the course of investigations were carried out without state security bodies presenting any evidence to substantiate their claims
7318514 he was not arrested while committing a crime and his blog does not mention anything about the alleged strike
7318515 makes clear that this police body can no longer be brought to account and is no longer subject to the supervision of even the interior ministry which it is answerable to
7318516 bayyoumy has not committed any crime nor does his blog contain what security bodies allege it does
7318517 dont store a users email address for one reason and then send them bulk email for a completely different reason
7318518 the technical contact has a clear expectation of the types of messages theyll receive and that doesnt include marketing
7318519 if youre a news site for example and want to let people forward a news story to someone you should restrict them to sending it to a small number of email addresses id also check the ip theyre connecting from against the cbl and perhaps other carefully selected blocklists
7318520 if you are doing so and one of your neighbours spams you can end up listed
7318521 it stinks but if you share the same ip with a spammer ip based blocklists have the unpalatable choice of listing the ip and thereby blocking innocent bystanders as well as the spammer s or not listing the ip and letting the spammer spam away
7318522 the helo ehlo string should ideally match the full domain name
7318523 since they support internet abuse they really dont need to have the privilege of using it
7318524 we once had a guy threatening to sue us at dnswl org if we would not
7318525 any company getting a service level credit is probably in trouble
7318526 the operation was a success but unfortunately the patient died
7318527 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and st augustine said three months we dont know the point is it that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to chose
7318528 a problem caused the program to stop working correctly windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available
7318529 since were only on day four of our implementation lets just say if apps were on my baseball team it would be hitting at the bottom of the lineup
7318530 for me as the google apps administrator the disruption was pretty damn irritating aside from getting kicked out of email i need to do my own job it also forced me to completely refocus on figuring out whats happening with gmail and google apps
7318531 it was constant troubleshooting testing research posting to the google apps forums and so on plus theres the emotional strain of wondering whether you completely screwed up by moving everyone to google apps as our sole email system thats what freaked me out did google just make me look like an idiot
7318532 mostly that 20 drop is based on fear of another perhaps more damaging outage it hasnt happened but now i know it could happen any time and without warning and if it does i have virtually no recourse to get the service running again
7318533 if we began to experience a similar outage more than about two or three business hours per quarter wed probably make google apps and gmail a backup solution to a locally hosted mail system if we used it at all and it would likely be years before wed try a cloud based collaborative system again from any vendor
7318534 even though weve only had apps for a few days im already impressed with the customisation options the ability to completely ditch outlook makes apps a worthwhile service to our company
7318535 the gmail interface feels more intuitive and is significantly quicker than outlook and the mobile accessibility is a huge improvement over our old email service
7318536 google understands its tremendous responsibility to keep things up and running
7318537 no ones happy when theres downtime but theres always downtime ive seen exchange go down often many times youre left to your own it people to fix it that can be good or bad id rather it be googles problem theyve got a world class team their reputation is on the line over time theyre going to get better and better
7318538 by a mob of buddhist monks and supporters just last sunday
7318539 impose christianity down our throats by force even when it is most unwelcome
7318540 if necessary we will get down even ltte terrorists from jaffna to attack if necessary
7318541 but it had been operative since 1999 and was near the end of its life a portal was seen as giving strategic benefits and we contracted solnet to assist with investigating that
7318542 we found there were a number of portal capabilities that fitted our business goals
7318543 we gave kiwisaver a brand that was completely different than inland revenue but used the same services
7318544 personalisation and customisation were the keys making things easier to navigate and easier for voluntary compliance
7318545 unfortunately we had to manage kiwisaver and the infrastructure deployment in parallel
7318546 governance was established at a number of levels including architectural governance and the operational governance stream
7318547 if you go to kiwisaver online you dont know youre being hosted by inland revenue
7318548 because portals offer services they require on going governance and management

7318551 is more of an internal set of requirements and an indication that we continue to work on the product to make it better and better google has very high internal metrics that products have to meet before coming out of beta

7318553 this was an evolutionary change to the microsoft licensing that everyone expected
7318554 they introduced the kind of flexibility that you would expect for microsoft applications in virtual environments but its not all roses for certain customers
7318555 you dont have to have every target machine licensed ahead of time
7318556 the whole web 2 0 explosion has moved from the consumer and college student world to professionals in the business world
7318557 people dont just chat they connect with people and end up talking about things that have an impact on the business
7318558 we knew we had challenges to win the talent war
7318559 people arent going to go in as readily when the well is 75 empty
7318560 very early on we recognised the importance of connecting people within ibm and moving beyond a static view of the individual
7318561 weve added new dimensions to the profile capability to create the old fashioned camaraderie of the office
7318562 people find it through word of mouth when others blog about it or bookmark it
7318563 the promise of being able to go out and tap into 140 000 employees and use computer magic to do it was really attractive to us
7318564 we got schooled quickly that not only did we not know about technology we also didnt know how people would react to a planned social network
7318565 as with any big company its easy for the message of the customers to be lost when you dont turn your attention to the people who interact with them on a regular basis
7318566 until bsn theres always been a schism between the two
7318567 were trying to find ways to make visiting the loop marketplace a part of their workflow
7318568 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and st augustine said three months we dont know the point is it that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to chose
7318569 we predict between 30 and 50 of all retail will be online in the next five years
7318570 weve invested behind the scenes in our it and logistics infrastructure in order to maintain service efficiency
7318571 we are introducing new point of sale systems including more than 2000 new tills and 258 new hand held terminals to make stock checking easier and more efficient
7318572 in it we will implement new store systems new trading systems and new support systems we now have an integrated company wide it plan a three year road map that sets out how our systems will deliver every aspect of our business plan both within the uk and internationally
7318573 the ability to research and make more informed choices in a time of heightened price sensitivity is a key advantage of the online channel
7318574 retailers will increasingly look at business models that allow them to retain the maximum proportion of the consumer spend
7318575 given the fact they are shared certain events situations are beyond our control such as hosting and outsourcing so we need to have a clear understanding of the integration issues of customers and as such a part of the support staffs work is to troubleshoot customer sites automated threshold monitoring and tools greatly assist in reducing incidents
7318576 even the most robust design can be hit by catastrophic events beyond our control and as such we have a network of strategies and processes in place to ensure any service is returned to normality as quickly as possible these include risk planning escalation procedures vendor maintenance agreements security testing and close inter departmental liaison
7318577 it took off and reported a technical problem and tried to return to the airport
7318578 at the moment rescue teams fire brigades and medics are rushing to the crash site
7318579 when we wanted to see womething they showed it to us rather than having a better idea
7318580 we know the difficulty of molding your business to systems there is a lack of flexibility there not just in the software but in the mind set
7318581 theres no advantage to us or our customers in doing a fusion type exercise
7318582 i look forward to the day when oracles fusion is announced because on that day the entire oracle customer base becomes available to lawson
7318583 they are exceedingly happy upgrading and have extended their maintenance agreement
7318584 internet client software such as itunes twhirl second life and others seem to be adopted by individuals rather than organisations
7318585 certain organisations look the other way with a dont ask dont tell policy
7318586 firefox itunes and others are in use where there is a clear business need unless you are in a paramilitary environment where people follow the orders of the authorities its best to make allowances in the interest of productivity
7318587 if you dont then you are more of a cop and less of an enabler
7318588 but if we encountered one that caused problems then we would run it through the integration lab to try and resolve it
7318589 if it is unresolvable then we look for a friendly functional equivalent
7318590 as an it manager you dont want to paralyse your users
7318591 theres a huge benefit for it managers to be able to handle those applications
7318592 to bring those rogue applications into account in your troubleshooting process
7318593 you can wind up sitting there trying to troubleshoot the wrong problem
7318594 all our data is replicated between each site so if we lost auckland we have everything in wellington
7318595 we also run a lot of security systems from standard anti virus to a comprehensive anti intrusion detection system from ibm with firewall and all the standard security layers the ibm intrusion detection system gives us very good visibility of all the traffic going through the network
7318596 we put a lot of emphasis on redundancy because we want our guys to sleep
7318597 we allow three to four things that can fail and still be able to operate we are really good with our alerting and monitoring and error reports are available to all at any one time we have three people on call
7318598 we can have 70 000 people online and 10 000 auctions closing within an hour this means we have to be on top of things we recently had a brief failure because one of our databases was not being nice to us we are still looking at the underlying cause we had a cpu spike which resulted in our network traffic dropping for a four minute period
7318599 generally each component has at least one hot fail over and we also have the entire platform distributed over our primary and secondary datacentres to cover for disaster recovery
7318600 in these situations the web technology caters to over 20 times the ordinary traffic economically building and maintaining systems that cater to these peaks is challenging
7318601 we cater for the large capacity demands by sizing some components to deal with the load firewall or the smart use of content routing and caching
7318602 we run a 24x7 second level network operations centre which hands over the third level of support of required this isnt required for all applications of course just those that have a high financial or customer impact if they are not available we aim to maintain three consecutive backups online so we dont need to ship tapes in the event of a failure requiring restore from back up
7318603 a common issue that many technology teams are facing across many businesses is managing the volume and magnitude of change through the systems the business drivers for change are accelerating and we are constantly reviewing our control and change management practices to ensure we can overcome challenges as if they arise
7318604 however what really makes a difference is putting in place effective protocols for managing unplanned outages we help clients to train staff so they understand a system holistically not just their specialist area this can avoid a quick outrage turning into a major event
7318605 experiencing a few seconds of lag while pages load is more acceptable than sending the wrong product or not providing support when something goes wrong customers will judge an online business on the basis of the whole experience not just at the point at which they enter their credit card details
7318606 saas applications are harder than just websites as you need to maintain the software the databases and numerous messaging components
7318607 we have evolved sophisticated monitoring of servers and services that provide our infrastructure support team with 24 7 alerts on systems performance and availability these are unique to our application not just systems
7318608 to ensure we have 24 7 we have evolved our monitoring systems to also look at the underlying health of the applications you can have problems at the application level
7318609 we create a separation between the service and part of the application and the actual physical hardware it is running on so the hardware becomes a commodity thats a similar approach to what companies like google would take

7318651 working as a board member of a residents association here is a fresh experience and i do not feel bothered at all
7318652 because japanese residents seemed to like living quietly i thought they would feel bothered if i talked to them
7318653 it has made it easier for foreign households who do not have japanese speaking members to join community life
7318654 it is because i want to be part of the community with my neighbors

7318664 the person who i believe will be the next and one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states joe biden
7318665 mostly i think what attracted senator obama was bidens wisdom
7318666 and not the kind of wisdom you get in washington dc but the kind of wisdom you get when you overcome adversity tragedy in your life as he has
7318667 he understands whats going on in this economy he doesnt believe as john mccain does that things are fundamentally sound and weve made great progress when people are losing ground all the time
7318668 i think barack obama did exactly what he said he was going to do he picked someone who complements him
7318669 he picks someone who is of his own mind and will not be a sycophant and picked someone who is knowledgeable in the ways of washington because if barack obama wants to effect change part of doing that is having somebody with you that knows the institutions that you are changing
7318670 great retail campaigner who really connects with people on a visceral level
7318671 they can run any attack ad they want but heres the issue americans want a change in the direction of this nation and especially the economy has come into the fore
7318672 joe is a guy who grew up in a working class household in scranton pennsylvania really understands what it is to have to scrap barack is a guy who comes from no means and no connections mother on food stamps when he was a kid

7318694 the statehood green party not the democratic or republican parties stands with the people of washington dc in our demand for the real citizenship democratic self government and full representation in congress that all other americans enjoy
7318695 were dismayed that democrats dcs largest political party have abandoned the goal of statehood
7318696 we dispute ms nortons assertion that dc is not ready for statehood and were unhappy that ms nortons submission to the democratic platform draft omits mention of statehood were as ready for statehood as everyone else in the us who already lives in a state
7318697 unlike the 2004 democratic platform the 2008 draft doesnt even endorse democratic self government the draft says we deserve the benefits of full citizenship especially the vote that are accorded to citizens of every state without explaining what these things mean or how theyre to be achieved its like saying every child deserves to be educated but refusing to endorse public schools especially the vote is even more ambiguous we already have the right to vote for president for our local elected officials and for our nonvoting delegate to the house but were still being under the boot of congress
7318698 talking points quotes on dc voting rights bill dc statehood and democracy
7318699 as we encourage democracy around the world we must extend democracy here at home we support equal rights to democratic self government and congressional representation for the citizens of our nations capital
7318700 a city that hands its police force a license to trash the constitutional rights of its citizens is not a city that is upholding law and order and protecting its citizens on the contrary unlimited police power is a complete breakdown of the law
7318701 these interrogations and checkpoints are comparable to police practices in authoritarian regimes and especially apartheid era south africa which is even more ominous given the fact the residents of these new red zones are mostly african american and poor
7318702 these policies have only empowered criminal gangs involved in the drug trade just as prohibition fed the growth of organized crime the aclu is right two of our most important freedoms the right of mobility and protection against warrantless search and seizure are being nullified for the sake of the disastrous war on drugs in violation of local law and the us constitution
7318703 democratic and republican politicians are equally responsible for the transformation of civilian police into militias
7318704 both the mccain and obama energy plans privilege corporate profits over the urgent need to transforms our nations energy policies both mr mccain and mr obama are seeking ways to preserve corporate profits at a time when the future of our planet is at stake
7318705 drilling in anwr would have little discernible impact on actual global oil supplies as its advocates well know the argument that it could nonetheless bring down oil prices is based not on hard economics but on market psychoanalysis drilling would send a message to the oil traders that more oil is on the way which would cause them to start betting down the price
7318706 americas first priorities must be conservation and efficiency the green party has an effective plan to reorganize the economy create millions of new jobs in conversion to safe clean energy conservation and expansion of public transportation to replace car traffic
7318707 without such an effort the disaster we witnessed in new orleans during and after katrina will take place on a global scale billions of people will see their homes livelihoods health and lives threatened while corporate interests exploit the devastation for more money and power
7318708 they raided our offices they confiscated our equipment and they detained everyone
7318709 it is an attempt to target me as i am always demanding the release of prisoners and talking against sectarianism
7318710 we categorically reject that any sudanese be tried outside sudan we will never surrender any citizen to be tried abroad
7318711 i met you you made me horny i jerked off you broke my heart die
7318712 seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran
7318713 the thing i would worry about is that it would almost look like a publicity stunt
7318714 dont dress too sexy people will eat you alive if you do the men will think you cant be pretty and smart and funny at the same time and the women will hate you so dress down
7318715 a rich black woman ooh buford i just dont know about that
7318716 oh no you are not gonna be black rich and thin uh uh miss o
7318717 i dunno just because its a whole black thing i guess
7318718 youre right that shit is funny why am i chickening out here lets put that baby back on the record
7318719 how can you do a show like that if youre teaching kids
7318720 i think it is so fantastic that you are living what you are teaching you are out there living your own dreams while you are inspiring kids to live theirs i love that and cant wait to see your show
7318721 oh my god i was just talking about that with someone
7318722 some say love it is a river that drowns the tender reed some say love it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed some say love it is a hunger an endless aching need i say love it is a flower and you its only seed its the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance its the dream afraid of waking that never takes the chance its the one who wont be taken who cannot seem to give and the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live when the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long and you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows lies the seed that with the suns love in the spring becomes the rose
7318723 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7318724 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7318725 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7318726 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7318727 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7318728 it was a tough time almost 36 hours it was very hard for many of us
7318729 they are very brave they are very strong i am proud of them
7318730 in this media war it was impossible for them israel to win because they have no case for what they are doing to your port and to your borders
7318731 we call for more activities to break the unfair siege imposed on our people
7318732 this decision was about these boats we will see what happens with any future boats
7318733 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7318734 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7318735 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7318736 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7318737 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7318738 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7318739 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7318740 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7318741 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7318742 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7318743 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7318744 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7318745 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7318746 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7318747 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7318748 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7318749 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7318750 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7318751 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7318752 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7318753 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7318754 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7318755 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7318756 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7318757 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7318758 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7318759 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7318760 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7318761 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7318762 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7318763 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7318764 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7318765 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7318766 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7318767 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7318768 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7318769 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7318770 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7318771 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7318772 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7318773 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7318774 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7318775 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7318776 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7318777 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7318778 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7318779 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7318780 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7318781 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7318782 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7318783 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7318784 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7318785 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7318786 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7318787 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7318788 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7318789 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7318790 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7318791 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7318792 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7318793 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7318794 who are open to doing something on the production side
7318795 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7318796 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7318797 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7318798 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7318799 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7318800 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7318801 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7318802 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7318803 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7318804 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7318805 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7318806 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7318807 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

7318810 ha sido un largo camino desde nuestra decisi n en julio de 2001 de traer los juegos ol mpicos a china pero que no quede duda alguna que tomamos la decisi n correcta
7318811 el mundo ha conocido sobre china y china ha conocido sobre el mundo y yo creo que esto es algo que tendr efectos positivos a largo plazo
7318812 somos primordialmente y ante todo una organizaci n dedicada al deporte pero el deporte con una misi n
7318813 el coi y los juegos ol mpicos no pueden forzar cambios en naciones soberanas o resolver todos los males del mundo pero podemos y es lo que hacemos contribuir en un cambio positivo por medio del deporte
7318814 algunos de los cambios en china soy obvios hoy en d a
7318815 otros se har n aparentes con el paso del tiempo el legado de estos juegos para china quedar n finalmente en manos del pueblo chino

7318817 es cierto que se me ha criticado por varias cosas
7318818 el tema de bolt me lo tomo con una gran sonrisa
7318819 reitero lo dicho dije que era un cono de los juegos junto a michael phelps tengo gran respeto por sus habilidades eso fue lo que consider y lo repito que deber a darle m s respeto a sus oponentes pero que a la vez es un hombre joven de 22 a os y que tiene tiempo para madurar
7318820 yo quer a oro antes de despedirme porque estos son mis ltimos juegos ol mpicos pero lamentablemente no se pudo nos falt ofensiva al final y nos quedamos con la plata
7318821 demostramos que el b isbol es un deporte que genera mucha emoci n y creemos que se merece la oportunidad de regresar
7318822 esa es una probabilidad dif cil porque el b isbol es un negocio demasiado grande no creo que las grandes ligas paren su torneo para los juegos ol mpicos

7318825 and you will never hear me complain about being brought up with the name dale earnhardt jr but dont for one minute believe that i had everything handed to me though if you knew my father you would never think that
7318826 when he dale sr was alive people treated you like you were a punk you knew at the end of the day anything he said or did overrided your choices
7318827 i was doing whatever i was told after he passed away i got treated as more of an adult
7318828 i was like yeah sure lets make a change im at the point now where i know i can win six races anytime i want
7318829 right now the balls in his court to decide on whether he wants to be a nascar driver or whether he wants to be a public personality
7318830 i dont want him going but i tell you what i dont want my grandsons or granddaughters going back in 15 years so how we leave makes a big difference
7318831 terrorism is a means not an end and very different groups and countries are using it toward very different goals if we cant even identify the enemy or describe the war were fighting its difficult to see how we will win

7318838 the single greatest strength america has in the middle east
7318839 if tomorrow peace broke out between israelis and palestinians does anybody think there wouldnt be a full blown war in iraq and conversely if iraq were transported to mars does anyone think there would not be terrorism visited upon the israelis every day
7318840 so lets get it straight israel is not the cause of iraq iraq being settled or not settled has nothing to do with israels conduct
7318841 from 9 11 americans can taste what it must feel like for every israeli mother and father when they send their kid out to school with their lunch to put them on a bus on a bicycle or to walk and they pray to god that cell phone doesnt ring

7318867 for 150 years people who are not commercial traders had no business being in the futures markets
7318868 to my sense there has to be a clear distinction between those who can legitimately trade and those who should not be trading

7318871 if the protecteur and preserver are going to be needed longer than expected we will also determine what needs to be done to keep our supply ships safe operational and available until they can be replaced
7318872 many of their systems are nearly obsolete such as the boilers they use to generate steam for main propulsion as you might expect its becoming increasingly difficult and costly to maintain these ships spare parts are no longer readily available and the skills needed to operate and maintain systems that were already mature in the 1960s are becoming increasingly rare

7318999 the united states invaded iraq based on false premises the administration orchestrated a public relations drive to prove that iraq had weapons of mass destruction and connections to the 9 11 terrorists both proved false
7319000 whereas the efforts of international weapons inspectors united states intelligence agencies and iraqi defectors led to the discovery that iraq had large stockpiles of chemical weapons and a large scale biological weapons program and that iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program that was much closer to producing a nuclear weapon than intelligence reporting had previously indicated
7319001 let me not pray to be sheltered from dangers but to be fearless in facing them let me not beg for the stilling of my pain but for the heart to conquer it

7319004 endorsing the agreement is not decided by the iraqi negotiator but it must be approved by the prime minister the political council for national security and the parliament
7319005 the agreement must garner the consensus of the parliament and will of the political system
7319006 very very close to finalising the agreement but had not yet clinched the deal

7319018 africa is the centre of the world with a population of almost one billion while the middle east north african region has a population of 400 million we have all the ingredients to make this project a reality
7319019 the idea is to finance the project in progressive phases and implement it step by step
7319020 our aim is to increase our non aviation revenues and passenger numbers at klia through creation of activities in the long term we want to make klia an airport city
7319021 a master plan has been developed outlining development options and submitted to the sepang municipal council we expect it to be approved in two months
7319022 in the meantime we will continue to generate awareness of the project among developers and investors both locally and abroad
7319023 we will self develop some of the development components for long term recurring rental income
7319024 we wont invite just anybody the developers and investors must offer premium development properties in order to maintain the klia brand of modern and high technology facilities this must be carried out throughout the whole development
7319025 we will also invite developers and investors to submit a rfp to develop and operate a 40ha theme park a logistics centre and golf courses at the airport land
7319026 the advantages our location has are its proximity to the airport the abundance of land and the presence of a low cost terminal
7319027 for this area to be successful it must be well connected as such we are proposing a tram or train line to connect the commercial centre to the airport
7319028 we are studying what is best we have allocated some parcels of land for this transport centre

7319031 i think if we make a preliminary assessment then one can say that the games contributed to further modernization of china
7319032 all of the preparations led to significant progress in the country i think it can also be said that the games contributed to a further opening up of china
7319033 if you think of china 20 years ago nothing of the sort would have been possible thousands of journalists were in china reported about china
7319034 i think it can be said that the olympic games made a positive contribution to the future of china
7319035 the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in london to celebrate the games of the xxx olympiad
7319036 thank you to the people of china to all the wonderful volunteers and to bocog

7319048 i have gone to prison because i did not want to reveal the existence of this super secret organization and now andreotti comes along and tells it to parliament
7319049 you had to attack civilians the people women children innocent people unknown people far removed from any political game
7319050 the reason was quite simple they were supposed to force these people the italian public to turn to the state to ask for greater security this is the political logic that lies behind all the massacres and the bombings which remain unpunished because the state cannot convict itself or declare itself responsible for what happened
7319051 could pass from a defensive post invasion logic to one of attack of civil war
7319052 those massacres those bombs those military actions had been organized or promoted or supported by men inside italian state institutions and as has been discovered more recently by men linked to the structures of united states intelligence
7319053 since this is a secret organization i wouldnt expect too many questions to be answered
7319054 if there were any links to terrorist organizations that sort of information would be buried very deep indeed

7319098 fighting for muslim self rule in the predominantly roman catholic nation for decades
7319099 fighting intensified overnight with battles raging near the towns of datu saudi ampatuan and datu piang all in the maguindanao province
7319100 we have done our best to embrace peace but the milf started the hostilities by pillaging villages and murdering innocent civilians in mindanao
7319101 this is a grim scenario and i don not even want to think about it but if the peace talks collapse then there will be war again in mindanao
7319102 the voice of reason is dwarfed by the voice of hatred and prejudice the peace talks are slowly breaking apart and if this continues may god help us all
7319103 we cannot subject our members to the laws of the government
7319104 fighting continued today with the military using air and ground assets apparently to get commander kato
7319105 people that are benefiting from the war in mindanao pre empted whatever good faith the government and the milf may have had by the onslaught of this violence that they have had and also by ugly prejudicial statements and actions coming from the non muslims of the area who are scared of losing whatever stakehold they might have in the bangsamoro area

7319112 obviously there cant be an education revolution for kids if theyre not at school and we are determined to make sure across australia that they are attending schools properly
7319113 there has to be what you would describe as reasonable grounds for being absent
7319114 the kid who is away for days on end without a medical certificate or without any other reasonable presentation of grounds those measures will kick in

7319130 what are you going to do come home to an empty house every night
7319131 people are friends and theyre honest people but situations change
7319132 you have to do this with a person you trust
7319133 i knew he wouldnt sacrifice paying the mortgage to do other things and he had to trust that i had enough money saved
7319134 if i were married it would be much easier to say i like this
7319135 i dont think any one can prepare for this role
7319136 its a lot of long hours seven days a week but you know what youre so busy you dont realize how crazy it is and its just getting crazier so
7319137 everyone said look were going to do this we think it is the right thing to open up this convention to the people of colorado and to the people of the country and to give them the opportunity to participate
7319138 people were a little overwhelmed at first but i think as we evolved as a team together and started planning this out we definitely realized that we could pull this off
7319139 it was fun watching teammates getting tossed into the river especially after they bragged how great they would be
7319140 most people throw very very sharp elbows to get a seat at the table and thats not matts style
7319141 hes quiet so people underestimate him underestimating him could be the biggest mistake that people can make
7319142 one of the things is having been on the obama staff during the primaries doing politics he knows who needs what who needs to be stroked more who needs little extra care there
7319143 he knows that all delegates are equal but some delegates are more equal than others
7319144 you cant plan for every option or any problem that might come up
7319145 but we have a really crack team a very talented team with years of convention experience theyve left no detail unturned
7319146 im not going to get into details of those conversations

7319154 to win another one lisa leslie got four and she wore all four to the game tonight i want to catch lisa i want to catch michael phelps
7319155 im just so excited about how many want to go forward
7319156 i know we have a lot of great young talent in the nba that will probably be on the 2012 team im more than committed to being on this team again
7319157 i look back at 2004 and im so proud right now
7319158 that person will have a structure that jerry and all these people have built
7319159 i think the greatest part of the continuity should be jerry and the players the ones who still feel like they can give that type of commitment
7319160 its like the weather you really cant tell whats going to happen but the caffeine idea is not beyond the realm of imagination
7319161 its a product that just like tobacco can be portrayed as some kind of diabolical thing being used against innocent people by wealthy corporations
7319162 if you said in 1970 or 1980 that people are going to bring enormous lawsuits against tobacco companies accuse them of fooling people into smoking cigarettes and then use that as a pretext to take a lot of money from them to run government programs people would have laughed at you
7319163 they would have said of course people choose as a matter of their own decision making whether or not to smoke nonetheless the lawsuits happened and i think caffeine is a plausible new target
7319164 there are some frivolous lawsuits that are brought to the court in this country but we are not suffering from a wave of them
7319165 in the main the courts do a very good job of sorting out what lawsuits are frivolous and what lawsuits are meritorious and as a whole plaintiffs lawyers dont get paid unless they win or settle a case so i think most of them tend to be very selective about the types of cases they bring to the court
7319166 i think its dr dean edell a syndicated radio host who says that if caffeine came as a white powder it would be illegal everybody likes it and everybody chooses whether or not to drink it but its also ubiquitous and lots of people make a lot of money from it so theres no reason why an opportunistic plaintiff wouldnt abuse the court system to make lots of money by suing starbucks
7319167 the crux of cases that tend to be successful are allegations that a manufacturer engaged in deliberate deception or in an outright failure to warn about harmful side effects that they knew about
7319168 there are a number of cases in which those allegations have been proved or were serious enough to result in a settlement as to public nuisance with very few exceptions the courts have not accepted public nuisance theories where there is an allegation that a product is harmful
7319169 the rhode island court came out with what i thought was a really good opinion
7319170 that state and several others said we have product liability law and if you want to allege that a product is dangerous you use product liability law
7319171 in the u s we have a big court system and a long history of using court litigation to address problems of injuries
7319172 one can imagine a system in which we use tort law less but those systems generally rely on a lot more regulation in this country we generally dont require people to go to the government to get permission to sell a new product when that decision was made there became a need for a body to decide what happens when someone gets injured by a product the decision was made to turn to the court and torts to resolve those issues
7319173 wants to cut down on tort litigation without providing another way to address the propensity for which a product causes injury
7319174 we have to see what kind of amendments come then only we can decide but we cannot accept prescriptive conditionalities
7319175 we still live in the country that was built by ivan the terrible
7319176 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7319177 she had 50 percent of the democratic vote obama has 50 percent of the democratic vote
7319178 you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7319179 senator joe bidens personal story has been tested many many times
7319180 when you overcome adversity tragedy in your life as he has the kind of wisdom you get in the working class communities of scranton pennsylvania and wilmington delaware
7319181 theyre equally good tickets hillary clinton obviously has a longer relationship with a broader spectrum of voters women voters
7319182 but joe bidens going to grow on the american people very fast
7319183 they had a discussion back in early june about it and he spent more time with senator clinton alone talking about issues than he has with joe biden or anyone else
7319184 knew her he knew her very well and so there wasnt the same need as there was for other candidates
7319185 theres no question that people had strong feelings about their nominee we went from beginning to end
7319186 i think thats going to be the role of the convention to really be a unifying time
7319187 hes got to talk about economic issues and hes got to be more clear
7319188 we need certainly senator obama to let the americans know what his plan is for as president of the united states how hes going to help rebuild restore the middle class
7319189 i dont accept that thats what barack obama hasnt been doing and i think that he will give a clear picture again this week of where we have to go
7319190 joe biden works in washington but he doesnt live there
7319191 he is somebody who never has forgotten where hes from hes a down to earth kind of guy
7319192 you can pull up a lot of quotes from august when these two guys were running against each other
7319193 its a legitimate issue mccain either forgot how many he has or he just wasnt being truthful with those reporters
7319194 youre out of touch if you have seven houses and dont even remember
7319195 the west has changed the independents in the west are really looking for leadership
7319196 the change that obama speaks of weve previewed it in the west
7319197 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7319198 it is interesting that obama would pick an older rich white male
7319199 assess the actual situation in tibet and let the world know the truth
7319200 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7319201 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7319202 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7319203 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7319204 except for some few mps who are in hiding all our elected 100 members of parliament should be there on monday
7319205 fighting is still going on we hit and destroyed over 40 militants bunkers and a training camp
7319206 we have confirmed reports that 50 militants were killed while 10 of our soldiers were martyred
7319207 they are scared of our peaceful but massive demonstrations for freedom
7319208 such repressive measures will not work we will emerge stronger and more vibrant
7319209 the decree can be defined as original or creative at best
7319210 even the judge who issued the decree states that no infringing material is hosted on the pirate bay which provides just a tracker search engine
7319211 the judge tries to create a sort of contributory infringement accusation against the pirate bay

7319233 o k i wasnt aware we were that far behind
7319234 were more ready to host now than anyones ever been
7319235 how is it that ucu is able to put up such nice facilities
7319236 those are the questions you should ask on the radio
7319237 commitment ucu is committed to developing sports and ucu knows you can accomplish a lot by sacrificing a little we built our sports complex with ucu money and were a private university with no government funding the only reason the other larger universities are unable to do the same is lack of commitment

7319243 hes a silly boy because if he had come here he could also have won gold if the olympics cannot motivate you to lose a few pounds then youre in trouble
7319244 i was on a 20 000 bonus from the aba if i won gold out here
7319245 so im going to be on their case when i get home
7319246 until i qualified for the olympics i was on 1 500 a month after the commonwealth games two years back i was only on 750

7319269 por lo que no resulta ocioso y mucho menos pueden considerarse prescritas diversas responsabilidades que a mi leal saber y entender deben ser estudiadas por la subcomisi n de examen previo y en su oportunidad por las comisiones unidas en t rminos de ley
7319270 las disposiciones transitorias negociadas por creel miranda e insertas en la propuesta hecha a zedillo a cambio de la restructura de los pasivos derivados del rescate bancario y de la exoneraci n pol tica y jur dica de su persona se han traducido en privilegios y prebendas financieras y fiscales con agravio al erario federal concertadas y consumadas en la ltima d cada por diversos agentes involucrados siendo directamente proporcional la participaci n a su ascenso pol tico
7319271 empleando para ello un mecanismo de restructura dise ado y operado directamente por alejandro creel cobi n desde la responsabilidad de la direcci n de cr dito corporativo del fobaproa y su subsecuente designaci n como vocal independiente en el ipab organismo en el que los acuerdos no s lo no fueron auditados t cnicamente por profesionales imparciales sino que dada la conformaci n de la junta de gobierno se agrava la profundidad de los costos e irracionalidad de decisiones que redundan en deficiencias de recuperaci n altos costos de administraci n de fideicomisos de cartera y eventualmente en la enajenaci n inexplicable de activos tangibles y crediticios del ipab a empresarios cercanos a vicente fox quesada
7319272 se hab a desempe ado a os antes en un puesto de restructuraci n crediticia en banco inverlat banco rescatado y que su hermano carlos creel cobi n era el responsable de una operaci n de rescate que rebasaba 23 mil millones de pesos en banco santander y que su primo eduardo creel hab a fungido como directivo y responsable del grupo financiero del sureste
7319273 debi ndose insistir en que creel miranda formul las propuestas de redacci n a las autoridades financieras e impuls junto con carlos medina plascencia la propuesta panista a la fecha tambi n hay indicios de que alejandro creel cobi n encabeza o mantiene directa relaci n con los accionistas rescatados de inverlat pretendiendo indemnizaciones o cantidades con cargo a los acuerdos alcanzados con las autoridades financieras no obstante que neg personalmente ante el senado tener el car cter de accionista de tal instituci n crediticia o de su controladora

7319279 durch die vorbereitungen auf die spiele blieben zu viele wichtige reformen liegen verdunkelte sich das weltweite image chinas stiegen die kosten um die preise k nstlich stabil zu halten ins astronomische

7319300 the key thing for us is to make the education revolution real for all kids including those kids where school attendance is a real problem
7319301 obviously there cant be an education revolution for kids if theyre not at school and we are determined to make sure across australia that they are attending schools properly
7319302 there has to be what you would describe as reasonable grounds for being absent
7319303 the kid who is away for days on end without a medical certificate or without any other reasonable presentation of grounds those measures will kick in
7319304 its part of our approach of mutual responsibility and we think it is an important way to go because its those kids who miss out from regular school attendance who are going to be the most vulnerable across the entire country
7319305 there has been a lot of discussion on all about symbians comments threads recently about drm piracy and commercial software

7319335 you would assume that the most sought after internships would be in areas that lead to the greatest financial reward young white people however prefer internships that put them on the path for careers that will generally result in a decrease of the material wealth accumulated by their parents
7319336 well being in an unpaid internship for a year is tough but afterwards youll get a high paying job and youll be able to pay off your debt and live a comfortable life
7319337 if all goes according to plan an internship will end with an offer of a job that pays 24 000 per year and will consist entirely of the same tasks they were recently doing for free when all is said and done the internship process serves the white community in many ways first it helps to train the next generation of freelance writers museum curators and director s assistants but more importantly internships teach white children how to complain about being poor

7319381 gracie mckeever combines old characters and settings with new and draws the reader ever closer to the newly maturing character of zara who is becoming more likable by the day the second installment in the zaras bois series ingenues choice is better formed than the first in the series and includes more dialogue with the two angels that started it all micah and jamaereh fans of m m and bdsm will appreciate the eroticism of this tale and the growth of the characters as they begin to heal old hurts
7319382 the third installment in the zaras bois series bouncers folly is a wonderful addition and continues the growth of zara and the people surrounding her i enjoyed the transition from zara the woman to zara the man which is an interesting journey and well written fans of m m and bdsm eroticism will be intrigued by this tale and zaras new lease on life
7319383 the developing romance between patryk and keir is very sweet and was a pleasure to read about the sex in this book is scorching hot and there is some mild bdsm too gracie mckeever does a great job at creating a lively and sometimes very funny story while depicting her characters in a very believable way ingenues choice is a very enjoyable paranormal story and im off now to read the third book in the series bouncers folly
7319384 this is the first work ive read by gracie mckeever and i enjoyed it a great deal the storyline which draws elements from different well known fairytales is tight and well written and the characters are all realistic and well developed heroine aziza lopez is the right combination of uncertain and independent because she and hunky hero david healey get to meet before he ends up a comatose patient on her nursing ward we also get to see her fiery side especially after she witnesses his shape shifting david is flawed but completely likable the nice guy driven by need who still tries to do the right thing i wasnt expecting the paranormal twist to this story when david turns to a wolf at the moment his life is put in danger but it fits right into the plot i dont normally read a lot of paranormal but i thought davids shifting between worlds was well done and easy to follow
7319385 gracie mckeever draws the reader immediately into the escalating conflict and sexual tension between moody detective luke gamble who meets his match in sultry tally calvalieri you cant help but feel up close and personal to the motivations of these two who battle from opposites sides of an investigation only to butt more than heads in this spicy encounter the grit and intensity of these characters leave a lasting impression as well the need for a cold shower all in all an intense read wrapped around well fleshed characters in more ways than one encased in a well written plot

7319399 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7319400 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7319401 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7319402 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7319403 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7319404 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7319405 we were going to pay two dollars for a hostel this place will have showers
7319406 according to some legend a 15th century emperor decided to have a sail on the lake hed beaten the chinese army or something and wanted to celebrate anyway he was sailing about probably waving to people when a golden turtle appeared from the depths it nicked his sword and swam down into the depths

7319414 the government want foreign company in vietnam so they get money they sell land to japanese but the government pay farmer for his paddy fields he get lot of money and he is very happy he buy big house
7319415 but farmer is uneducated man he soon spend all money and he has no way of feeding family now his land is gone he cannot sell his rice he become very poor man this farmer and lots of others like him are now big problem for my government
7319416 then sell them as you can see some have been bought and completed
7319417 he was chasing a monkey when he lost sight of the animal when he investigated he discovered the monkey had gone into a hole the policeman looked into hole and discovered big cave

7319428 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7319429 wanneer iemand dit leest zal ik er waarschijnlijk niet meer zijn hopelijk is mijn plan geslaagd en heeft niemand mij op tijd gevonden het enige wat ik echt zal missen en misschien veel te weinig getoond heb toen ik nog in leven was zijn mijn vrouwtje griet en mijn twee schatten van kinderen sara en simon ik hoop dat er jullie een mooie toekomst staat te wachten en dat jullie gelukkig mogen worden in het leven het is misschien beter om enkel door een moeder opgevoed te worden dan door een moeder en vader waarvan de vader door en door slecht is griet ik heb het misschien te weinig gezegd en te weinig getoond maar ik hield enorm veel van je ondanks mijn uitspattingen met andere vrouwen zonder jou zou het leven veel minder aangenaam zijn geweest ik ga jullie alledrie enorm missen maar treuren jullie maar niet teveel om mij ik ben het namelijk niet waard goodbye hans
7319430 de vraag is maar of deze verrassing ook voor hem zo leuk zal zijn
7319431 wel wie is het dan je bent er precies wel door aangeslagen
7319432 zeg dat het niet waar is zeg dat je je vergist truus is niet dood
7319433 wat ik bedoel kan je dat zelf niet raden het is hier de afgelopen dagen te rustig geweest wat de reden hiervoor is kan mij eerlijk gezegd niet veel schelen maar zo kan het wat mij betreft niet verder dus heb ik daar wat aan gedaan zoals de meeste intussen weten heeft de griek voor ons enkele nieuwe meisjes in oost europa uitgezocht
7319434 ik heb inderdaad interessant videomateriaal gekregen van enkele van die dames het zal dus zeker de moeite zijn nu ja of jullie het nu lekkere meiden vinden of niet dat kan mij geen ne moer schelen zolang onze klanten het maar lekkere hapjes vinden en bereid zijn er veelvuldig voor te betalen
7319435 komaan mannen even serieus en wat dat uittesten betreft daar zullen we het later wel nog eens over hebben
7319436 wanneer komen die geile meiden dan naar hier of moeten wij naar oost europa
7319437 idioten hou nu toch eens allemaal jullie kop en luister
7319438 axel jij blijft hier beneden en kuist samen met enkele meisjes de club zo dat die er weer dik in orde uit ziet om deze avond open te gaan
7319439 haha en boven staan de bedden en liggen er hete meiden op ons te wachten
7319440 goed dan verwacht ik nu dat iedereen aan het werk gaat en dat alles piekfijn in orde is
7319441 ik begrijp eerlijk gezegd ook niet waarom wij alles in orde moeten maken het zijn toch nieuwe werknemers die kunnen toch zelf hun boeltje in orde brengen
7319442 jij moet nog veel leren verstraeten nog heel veel leren
7319443 mams ik ben al een hele tijd wakker ik heb met amber gebeld
7319444 ah vandaar dat goede humeur hoe stelt amber het heeft ze iets verteld over brandy en babette
7319445 babette is weer de carrierevrouw die ze altijd is geweest ze is amper thuis en kijkt met moeite naar haar dochter om
7319446 tja ik heb me altijd al vragen gesteld over de opvoedkundige kwaliteiten van mijn dochter ik heb nooit een moeder in haar gezien
7319447 brandy stelt het goed ze heeft zich al snel weer aangepast in het leven in de grote stad maar ze heeft amber toch al enkele keren gezegd dat ze haar grandmum mist
7319448 verbaasd je dat dat kind weet toch wie haar liefde kan geven en ook geeft ik heb je hier voldoende bezig gezien met brandy je zorgde erg goed voor haar
7319449 misschien is dat wel een kortstondige tweede kans die ik heb gekregen
7319450 maar nu het belangrijkste vertel eens over amber mist ze je
7319451 ontzettend net zoals ik haar mis e n dag zonder haar is n dag teveel
7319452 je ziet die meid echt graag h jammer dat je haar niet hebt kunnen tegenhouden wie weet was brandy dan ook nog hier
7319453 wel misschien hoef je haar niet lang meer te missen
7319454 ik wil het eigenlijk met iets belangrijks over jou hebben
7319455 daarover wil ik het nu met jou hebben ik heb beslist om mijn studies in amerika verder af te maken dan ben ik dicht bij amber en zo een populaire universiteit met een erg goede reputatie opent vast grotere toekomstperspectieven
7319456 ja maar ik ga niet alleen ik heb namelijk een vlucht naar amerika geboekt voor mezelf en mijn oude moedertje
7319457 ja ik ga er natuurlijk voor lange tijd blijven maar jij hebt na alles wat er de afgelopen tijd gebeurd is dringend nood aan wat vakantie
7319458 die zal ik dan ook van harte nemen bedankt jongen
7319459 maar na die vakantie kom ik ook niet meer terug naar hier
7319460 er is niets dat me hier nog bindt jongen en al zeker niet als jij ook het ouderlijke huis verlaat ik heb er al even aan gedacht ik wilde jou niet in de steek laten maar nu jezelf vertrekt heb ik besloten om de villa hier te verkopen en een optrekje te zoeken dicht bij mijn voorlopig enige kleinkind
7319461 ja net als jij ik wil dicht bij mijn kleinkind zijn en zodoende zal jouw amber niet meer alleen moeten instaan voor de opvoeding van brandy ik kan haar helpen en zo heeft zij meer tijd om met jou door te brengen wat denk je
7319462 dat jij me helpt om in die grote stad een stulpje te zoeken
7319463 bel je vriendinnetje maar snel terug en vertel ze maar snel het goede nieuws ik denk dat zij ook in de wolken zal zijn om dit te horen
7319464 meneer vleugels ik zie je volgende week terug en tegen dan verwacht ik de resultaten van je bloedonderzoek indien er verdere behandeling nodig is maar die verwacht ik eigenlijk niet dan zal je het met mijn collegas moeten stellen
7319465 oh ja ik heb dat briefje gelezen u en uw dochter gaan dus echt weg
7319466 ja meneer vleugels mijn dochter en ik verlaten deze praktijk we laten deze over aan onze collegas die overigens uitstekend werk verrichten voor ons is het tijd om een nieuwe stap in het leven te zetten we zijn niet meer van de jongste h
7319467 en heb ik het goed begrepen en gaat u aan de kust een praktijk overnemen
7319468 dat heeft u inderdaad goed begrepen mijn dochter neemt een praktijk over van een oude vriend die praktijk ligt in langevroeg aan de kust dus ik ga er ook gaan werken maar niet meer zo intensief als hier de kust is de ideale plaats om stilaan af te bouwen
7319469 daarin heb je gelijk dokter maar brugge is anders ook wel een mooie stad om uit te bollen
7319470 ja dat geloof ik graag meneer vleugels dat geloof ik graag tot volgende week
7319471 tot volgende week dokter ik hou je waarschijnlijk van al je werk af met al mijn gepraat ik ga mijn gepraat verder gaan zetten in een caf etje op de markt
7319472 ja maar dat is niet alles dit is niet zomaar een ring
7319473 neen broertje dit is mijn verlovingsring herman heeft mij deze middag op het strand ten huwelijk gevraagd het was zo romantisch ik heb ja gezegd ik ga trouwen
7319474 oh alles zit nog in een pril stadium maar ik heb sinds kort een meisje leren kennen zo inderdaad zo van de tweeling barbara zo de zusjes die in boek twee een relatie met patje en stuart hebben gehad heet ze ze studeert hier in brugge sociaal werk en zit hier op kot maar ze woont in langevroeg
7319475 en daar is langevroeg weer het lijk wel of onze hele familie iets met de stad langevroeg heeft
7319476 blijkbaar zitten daar de mooie vrouwen en de mannen of althans degene waar dit gezin voor valt
7319477 euhm zoals je ziet is de wachtkamer leeg en ik verwacht de volgende pati nt maar binnen een halfuurtje daarna neemt peter het over waarom
7319478 omdat ik anders wel zin heb om een glaasje champagne te drinken op het liefdesleven van de familie dupont
7319479 goed dat doen we maar dan drinken we er eentje op jouw verloving met herman ik ben zo blij voor jou
7319480 als het goed is slaap ik de champagne over want ik moet dringend weg zo wacht op mij aan t zand en ik ben al te laat ik zou wel graag vanavond een glaasje drinken dus als jij een glaasje wil over houden
7319481 dat zullen we doen laat je nieuwe vriendinnetje maar niet wachten
7319482 zusje ik zou je aanraden om naar het az te komen ik breng hans er meteen naartoe
7319483 je gaat mij toch niet vertellen dat je al die tijd hebt gewerkt komaan dat jij dagen en nachten in het ziekenhuis bent geweest dat maak je zelfs een dom blondje niet wijs
7319484 waarom moet je echt weten waar ik geweest ben ik pluis toch ook je hele agenda niet uit trouwens als je het echt wilt weten ik ben naar een congres geweest in de ardennen
7319485 de ardennen meneer gaat op reis en zijn vrouw weet van niets ik had gisteren nochtans een belangrijke afspraak met
7319486 als ik jou verborgen agenda niet mag weten dan mag jij ook niet weten met wie ik zoal afspreek
7319487 ik heb je toch net verteld dat ik naar de ardennen ben geweest en als je het interesseert het was met een mannelijke collega
7319488 alsof er geen vrouwelijke dokters op dat congres zijn geweest ik kan mij voorstellen dat je het best gezellig vond
7319489 ik vond het vooral zenuwslopend als je dat mag weten wij dokters zijn op zo een congres met belangrijke themas bezig
7319490 ja ja dat kan ik goed geloven nu ja rik ik zou het alleszins appreci ren moest je me volgende keer op de hoogte brengen als je er een paar dagen tussenuit knijpt ik heb nu een afspraak bij de manicure moeten afzeggen ik ben niet kunnen gaan shoppen want met zo een kind is dat nogal moeilijk je kan dan niet gewoon van winkel naar winkel hossen en alles rustig bekijken er stond trouwens geen geld meer op de speciale rekening heb jij dat geld er afgehaald
7319491 en waarom dan wel ik dacht dat geld bedoeld was voor christianos opvoeding
7319492 voor christianos opvoeding ja niet om eens een gezellig middagje te gaan shoppen
7319493 de limiet van mijn creditcard is overgeschreden voor deze maand en op mijn bankrekening staat er ook niet veel meer ging jij niet wat geld storten of heeft dat tripje naar de ardennen je een maandloon gekost
7319494 neen tuurlijk niet trouwens een congres wordt betaald door het ziekenhuis wat maar meer dan normaal is
7319495 kan jij trouwens je vader niet wat geld vragen of zoals elke normale mens voor je geld gaan werken
7319496 oh ja er ligt een brief van het ziekenhuis op de tafel besparen op hun dokters dat kunnen ze daar wel maar geld voor postzegels hebben ze blijkbaar genoeg kunnen ze je die niet gewoon bezorgen wanneer je aan het werk bent
7319497 een brief van het ziekenhuis wat staat daar dan in
7319498 ik respecteer jou privacy koninckx ik open dus je brieven niet maar als je het echt wilt weten moet je hem maar openmaken ik hoop alleen dat het weer geen uitnodiging voor een congres is dit weekend pas jij op je zoon ik ga er even tussenuit met een vriendin wij gaan naar een wellnesscentrum in spa
7319499 wel misschien kan ik jou binnenkort een extra zakcentje geven
7319500 hoezo krijg je opslag wordt je waarde als dokter eindelijk gewaardeerd en wordt dat ook uitbetaald
7319501 neen dat niet maar misschien wordt ik binnenkort wel het nieuwe afdelingshoofd van de polikliniek mijn kandidatuur is alvast goedgekeurd en ik moet binnenkort op een gesprek nu ja jij weet net als ik wie er in de raad van bestuur zit en dus wel zal zorgen dat ik de job krijg
7319502 je pa leo zal er inderdaad wel voor zorgen dat jij het nieuwe afdelingshoofd wordt en ik ben fier als je het wordt maar dan wel op n voorwaarde
7319503 dat je nog tijd hebt voor je gezin en niet nog meer uren zal kloppen als nu
7319504 ik beloof niets maar als ik het wordt zal ik mijn best doen
7319505 maar als afdelingshoofd komt er natuurlijk wel extra werk bij kijken
7319506 we doen straks wel verder waar we mee bezig zijn
7319507 gered door de bel of eerder het gehuil bedankt christiano
7319508 goed meneer van den eynde als u jouw verklaring wilt tekenen dan kan u wat mij betreft beschikken
7319509 ik zou nog n ding willen weten meneer de journalist
7319510 met alle respect meneer de agent maar ik denk niet dat ik nog langer op u vragen moet antwoorden
7319511 ben jij er zeker van dat je alles verteld hebt
7319512 ik zweer jullie dat ik alles verteld heb goed als dat alles was dan ga ik nu terug naar de redactie een krant schrijft zichzelf niet
7319513 u bent dus op verzoek van jou hoofdredacteur begonnen met een reeks undercoverreportages over vrouwenhandel en prostitutie in dat kader bent u hier in onze stad terecht gekomen
7319514 ja zoals ik jullie verteld hebt er zijn aanwijzingen dat er binnenkort enkele meisjes uit oost europa naar een nachtclub aan de belgische kust worden gebracht waar ze noodgedwongen in het prostitutiemilieu verzeild geraken nu ja die reportage kadert nog in een pril stadium
7319515 en jij bent in contact gekomen met willy simons een ex portier van the blue lagoen
7319516 meneer de agent je valt in herhaling alles staat toch op papier
7319517 ja maar ik wil het graag nog eens uit je mond horen voor alle zekerheid ik wil niet onnodig fouten maken
7319518 jij bent onzeker lokaal agentje laat die kerel toch gaan hij heeft alles net uitgelegd
7319519 ja willy simoens wilde samen met zijn vriendin eefje de haen uit het milieu stappen en de ex portier wilde na lang aandringen enkele onthullingen doen die volgens hem enorm schokkend zijn hij wist meer over de moord op twee afrikaanse meisjes en hij kon mij meer vertellen over een uit de hand gelopen sm spelletje
7319520 dat heb ik al gezegd ik weet het niet het zou kunnen maar er zou iemand belangrijk bij betrokken geweest zijn een belangrijk politiek persoon
7319521 hans witters jouw krantje vernoemd toch al enkele dagen zijn naam in een politiek schandaal
7319522 ik ken niet zo heel veel van de lokale politiek maar die naam is inderdaad wel gevallen op de redactie nu ja het is nu aan jullie om dat uit te zoeken ik heb alles verteld wat ik weet
7319523 nogmaals bedankt meneer de journalist voor uw onthullende maar nietszeggende verklaring
7319524 als jullie die willy simons wat politiebescherming hadden gegeven bescherming die hij dus duidelijk nodig had als die caravan niet ontploft was dan had willy uit de biecht geklapt en dan stond niet alleen ik met mijn undercoverreportages maar ook jullie met jullie onderzoeken een hele stap verder
7319525 aangezien er ingerommeld was denk ik van wel laat mij n ding duidelijk zijn maar dat weet je waarschijnlijk wel het milieu waar ik over schrijf is erg gevaarlijk jouw vriendinnetje had er zich misschien beter niet mee gemoeid wie weet wat er met haar is gebeurd nu ja dat is dan wel haar eigen schuld
7319526 laat dat max hij kan er toch ook niet aan doen dat er nog steeds geen nieuws over truus is
7319527 hij kan er toch ook niet aan doen dat er nog steeds geen nieuws over truus is
7319528 ik zie dat het vandaag erg goed met je gaat
7319529 ja ik heb mij eigenlijk sinds lang zo goed niet meer gevoeld die paar zonnestraaltjes die hier naar binnenkomen doen er ook wel deugd aan
7319530 binnenkort hebben we nog meer zon eens we samen in portugal zijn
7319531 is is het dan allemaal geregeld met dominique deed ze dan echt niet meer moeilijk over de scheiding
7319532 die kan snel uitgesproken worden dominique besefte maar al te goed dat het voor haar alles of niets zou zijn als ze niet op mijn voorwaarden was ingegaan zou het er hard aan toe gaan in de rechtbank en was de kans groot
7319533 inderdaad nu krijgt zij het huis en alle meubels en heb ik haar een bedrag gegeven waar mevrouw de geldwolf voldoende mee kan gaan shoppen en wij wij kunnen binnen enkele dagen eindelijk gerust zijn
7319534 wij kunnen eindelijk de tweede kans die we hebben gekregen grijpen
7319535 vanaf nu zijn we weer een echt gezin jij ik en mathijs
7319536 dat kan je wel zeggen alles is in kannen en kruiken wij kunnen binnen enkele dagen vertrekken
7319537 jij kan ook precies niet meer wachten om te vertrekken
7319538 wat zijn jullie allemaal achter mijn rug aan het bekokstoven
7319539 wel ik ben zo net even langs het reisbureau geweest en onze vliegtuigtickets richting portugal zijn in orde
7319540 euhm ik wil de pret nu niet verstoren maar klopt die datum wel dat is over al over drie dagen ik weet nog niet eens of ik tegen dan dit ziekenhuis al mag verlaten
7319541 tuurlijk mag je het ziekenhuis dan verlaten over je spullen moet je je geen zorgen maken mathijs en ik hebben al enkele dozen ingepakt en er is reeds een eerste lading richting ons huisje in portugal verstuurd
7319542 ik krijg van dokter dirk de nodige instructies voor de verdere behandelingen en ik heb ook al iets geregeld met een verpleegster uit het dorp waar we gaan verblijven
7319543 ik ben eigenlijk vooral blij dat ik dit nog mag mee maken en dan vooral met jullie twee in mijn buurt de twee belangrijkste mannen uit mijn leven
7319544 de incheckbalie gaat binnen enkele ogenblikken open het gaat dus niet lang meer duren voor we in de lucht hangen
7319545 oh ik popel al om brandy terug te zien denk jij dat ze blij zal zijn om haar oma terug te zien
7319546 onnozelaar brandy zal denk ik blij zijn dat er vanaf nu iemand is die de nodige tijd voor haar vrijmaakt want haar moeder
7319547 haar moeder is een keiharde zakenvrouw en zal dat ook altijd blijven
7319548 je bent toch niet van plan om de job van amber over te nemen
7319549 amber mag op haar twee oortjes slapen ik vind dat ze heel goed werk verricht met brandy en je ziet zo dat die twee elkaar graag hebben nu ja als amber wat meer vrij is heeft ze meer tijd voor jou dan kunnen jullie misschien aan een tweede kleinkind voor mij beginnen
7319550 ho ho zo ver zijn we nog lang niet maar er wordt aan gewerkt
7319551 ga weg rudy heeft je vast gestuurd om nog meer uit mij te krijgen al dan niet met rake klappen
7319552 wees gerust ik kom niet omdat rudy mij gestuurd heeft
7319553 wat kom je dan wel doen wil jij van mij profiteren ik heb daar nu geen zin in ik ben trouwens ook niet van dat wegwerpmateriaal waar je even van kan genieten koop je een opblaaspop
7319554 ik wil helemaal niets van je ik wil je alleen maar helpen
7319555 hoe wil jij in godsnaam proberen om mij te helpen
7319556 dat weet ik nog niet precies maar ik vind er wel iets op
7319557 ik heb gezien hoe joke weg liep uit de club en ik heb haar laten lopen
7319558 maar waarom dan je weet toch hoe je zal eindigen als rudy dit te weten komt
7319559 als ik je ergens mee kan helpen moet je het maar zeggen ik zal zien wat ik voor je kan doen
7319560 jij wil me alleen maar helpen omdat je dan een tegenprestatie verwacht zo zijn mannen
7319561 niet iedereen is wie zegt dat hij is of wie men denkt dat hij is
7319562 en heb je nog toekomstplannen wil je hogerop geraken in het ziekenhuis of zou je het zien zitten om net als diane thuisverpleger te worden in mijn praktijk
7319563 ja misschien wel maar ik ben wel enorm benieuwd naar je antwoord
7319564 wel dan zal ik je daar een duidelijk antwoord opgeven
7319565 wel tuurlijk droom ik er van om ooit hoofdverpleger te worden in het az welke verpleger droomt er niet van om hogerop te geraken ik denk dat dat nog even op zich zal laten wachten in het az hebben we namelijk een heel goede hoofdverpleegster en ik denk dat irene er niet rap de brui aan zal geven zij leeft echt voor haar beroep en wat ze doet dat doet ze goed ik heb echt bewondering voor het werk dat zij verricht
7319566 dat kan ik alleen maar beamen irene is echt goed in haar vak maar we hadden het niet over irene maar over jou zegt thuisverpleging je iets
7319567 onder andere maar dat hoeft niet als je dat niet wilt
7319568 ik zou niets liever willen misschien moeten we dat wel eens in overweging nemen dan kan ik tijdens de vrije uren verdwalen in je ogen en verder dromen
7319569 waarover zou je dan dromen of liever nog welke grote droom wil je nog verwezenlijken
7319570 heb ik je eigenlijk al verteld over mijn grote droom
7319571 ik ben verpleger geworden omdat ik mensen wil helpen en dan vooral voor jongeren of mensen die het moeilijk hebben die het niet al te breed hebben ik loop al een hele tijd met plannen rond om hier in langevroeg te starten met een opvangcentrum
7319572 het is ook een interessant project het is alleen niet zo simpel om het waar te maken er zijn genoeg mensen die ik kan helpen en genoeg jongeren die het moeilijk hebben en hulp nodig hebben maar in de eerste plaats komt het er op aan een geschikte locatie te vinden
7319573 een locatie vinden ik wil je daar wel bij helpen
7319574 echt waar we moeten dan wel ook nog vergunningen aanvragen bij het gemeentebestuur ook iets dat mij niet zo eenvoudig lijkt
7319575 och als we onze plannen goed op papier zetten en die kunnen duidelijk maken aan het gemeentebestuur moet het vast wel gaan lukken met die vergunningen
7319576 om heel eerlijk te zijn lijkt het mij een ideaal idee om mensen te kunnen helpen en niet alleen op een medische manier we moeten natuurlijk ook mensen uit de sociale sector warm maken voor dit project en misschien kunnen we ook wel enkele andere dokters verplegers en mensen uit het ziekenhuis warm maken eens we zo ver zijn
7319577 ik vind het geweldig dat jij hier zo positief op reageert maar misschien moeten we dit plan nog eventjes uitstellen en ons eerst maar concentreren op ons trouwfeest
7319578 ja dat zal natuurlijk de eerstkomende tijd heel wat uren in beslag nemen maar intussen kunnen we ook verder werken aan het project ik zou zeggen we toosten op je project
7319579 blizz blizz ben je boven of ben je al in de keuken aan het werk
7319580 ik heb u dochter probeer niets of je ziet ze niet meer terug informatie volgt
7319581 deze dag kan dan toch nog verschrikkelijker eindigen dan hij begonnen is
7319582 fout meneer de busschere je hebt recht op n telefoontje
7319583 e n telefoontje e n telefoontje geef mij dan een telefoon zodat ik een gesprek kan voeren kan ik er aan doen dat jij je tijd hier moet verzitten doen
7319584 vraag het wat beleefder en dan zal ik zien wat ik kan doen
7319585 kan jij op de gang wachten ja ik heb toch recht op een beetje privacy niet
7319586 hannes wat voor spelletje ben je aan het spelen ben je vrij ik ben trouwens niet cedric maar neil
7319587 opgepakt euhm het is te zeggen ik ben nu in het ziekenhuis en er is een bewaker voor mij deur geplaatst
7319588 niets bijzonders alleen is het van hier veel gemakkelijker om weg te geraken die flikken zijn niet van plan om mij snel los te laten ze hebben in de gaten dat ik wel het n en het ander weet dat hen kan verder helpen ik moet vooral zien te voorkomen dat die ondervragingen mij weer de spuigaten uit lopen ik wil hier weg en daarom heb ik je hulp nodig
7319589 mijn hulp heb jij mijn hulp nodig ik heb jouw hulp nodig ja wie gaat er anders deze nacht pillen gaan verkopen
7319590 jij moet mij helpen en dan kan ik snel weer voor je werken
7319591 wel je doet je voor als cedric mijn oudere broer die mij komt opzoeken en je zorgt er voor dat je niet alleen bent bedenk maar wat maar ik heb dringend een pistool nodig
7319592 dat kan ik wel voor je regelen maar dan moet je me wel beloven van zodra je daar weg komt dat je mij helpt om de zaak verder te zetten
7319593 daar kan je op rekenen broer ik reken er op dat ik krijg wat ik wil verzin maar iets en zorg dat je ongezien met dat wapen voorbij de politiecontrole geraakt
7319594 ik verzin wel wat desnoods steek ik dat wapen in n of andere taart en kom ik er zo wel mee in
7319595 doe je best want ik wil hier zo snel mogelijk weg ik verwacht je morgen
7319596 wel jouw dochter blizz heeft daarnet gebeld ze heeft gevraagd of jij haar wil terugbellen
7319597 mevrouw de verpleegster weet u iets over de toestand van hans witters
7319598 nog iemand die weigert om informatie te verschaffen wat voor een ziekenhuis is dat hier eigenlijk
7319599 sorry meneer maar ik heb de bevoegdheid niet om die informatie te verschaffen als u dan nu zo vriendelijk wil zijn om weg te gaan van die deur
7319600 als je maar niet denkt dat ik hier weg ga voor ik weet wat er met hans is gebeurd ik wil hem zien
7319601 en heb jij onze schepen van cultuur en feestelijkheden er door gekregen
7319602 ik dacht al een pati nt die er zo erg aan toe was er door te krijgen dat lukt niet op zo een korte tijd anders was je vast superdokter geweest
7319603 verpleegstertje voor u is het nog altijd dokter hofman waarom zou ik mijn mening niet mogen geven
7319604 omdat u mening op dit moment ongepast is wij zijn collegas van elkaar en we moeten elkaar steunen we moeten niet op elkaars kap zitten omdat het eens fout loopt hoeveel pati nten heb jij in de afgelopen tijd verloren wij zijn geen helden of supermensen en soms zijn de slachtoffers er gewoon te erg aan toe om ze er nog door te krijgen wat bij meneer witters het geval was frank heeft zijn uiterste best gedaan maar het heeft niet mogen zijn
7319605 je gaat gewoon te ver iedereen kent jouw reputatie hier maar moet je die ook meteen aan een nieuwe collega bekendmaken
7319606 dokter misschien kunt u mij vertellen hoe het met hans witters is
7319607 helemaal niet jij hebt gedaan wat iedere dokter zou doen jij hebt geprobeerd om jouw pati nt te redden maar dat is niet gelukt
7319608 en dat op mijn eerste werkdag hier ze gaan het zich nog lang herinner en ik zal er ook vaak aan moeten terug denken
7319609 frank hoeveel pati nten heb je in antwerpen niet gered
7319610 je hebt gelijk maar het is gewoon rot om iemand kwijt te raken ik probeer
7319611 hij zegt altijd soms win je er eentje en soms verlies je er n maar als je het goed hebt aangepakt dan valt er je niets te verwijten en dat is ook zo jij hebt helemaal niet gefaald trouwens
7319612 trouwens hoe is die hans hier terecht gekomen wilde die hans niet zelf uit het leven stappen ik weet het natuurlijk niet maar je polsen over snijden dat doe je toch omdat je weg wilt uit dit leven
7319613 die hans zal het misschien niet meer weten of beseffen maar zijn plannetje is gelukt hij was er gewoon al veel te erg aan toe wanneer hij hier beland is
7319614 het wordt anders een moeilijke taak we moeten mevrouw witters en haar familie inlichten over wat er met hans gebeurd is
7319615 ja kom maar mee naar de wachtkamer dan kan ik mevrouw witters ook meteen op de hoogte brengen
7319616 ik wil hier weg ik heb helemaal niets waarom houden jullie mij hier vast
7319617 wij houden je helemaal niet vast maar we moeten enkele onderzoeken doen
7319618 onderzoeken ik heb geen onderzoeken nodig want ik mankeer niets helemaal niets
7319619 oh neen en die aanvallen die jij in je cel hebt gekregen
7319620 en wie gaan jullie daar voor mee brengen ik heb niets ik voel mij kiplekker
7319621 blijven liggen meneer de busschere de dokters willen je alleen onderzoeken
7319622 meneer als je nu niet opnieuw gaat liggen en de dokter je niet laat onderzoeken dan zal ik je wat moeten geven om te kalmeren
7319623 doe dat dan geef trouwens maar een extra dosis dan kan ik lekker high worden
7319624 oh meneer zit dus aan de drugs misschien dat die aanvallen daar wel afkomstig van zijn
7319625 zoek dat dan toch uit en waar blijft dat kalmeringsmiddel
7319626 ik ik ben zo blij dat ik je zie waarom heb je niets van je laten horen
7319627 ik ik ben zo bang geweest ik dacht na alles wat ik gehoord heb en wat er gebeurd is met yasmina en izzy dacht ik ik dacht dat ik je voor altijd kwijt was
7319628 mij raak je zo snel niet kwijt alles is nu voorbij
7319629 wel jouw dochter blizz heeft daarnet gebeld ze heeft gevraagd
7319630 dag zusje dat is lang geleden ik wist helemaal niet dat
7319631 bart amaai jij bent echt jij bent groot geworden broertje
7319632 het is dan ook al een hele tijd geleden dat we elkaar niet meer hebben gezien jij was achttien geloof ik toen je bij ons thuis bent weggegaan
7319633 en jij was vierentwintig was al het huis uit maar je kwam nog heel regelmatig van mamas lekkere maaltijden genieten
7319634 ik wist helemaal niet dat jij hier zou zijn chantal je weet wel riks vrouw
7319635 ja wij hebben al enkele keren de eer gehad om onaangenaam kennis te maken
7319636 zo onaangenaam zal het wel niet geweest zijn dit buitenverblijfje van de koninckx familie is nu in hun handen en chantal wil niet dat er iemand buiten zichzelf hier langskomt dat ze jou de sleutel heeft gegeven is dan toch wel wat vreemd ze had namelijk gezegd dat er hier niemand zou zijn
7319637 laat ons zeggen dat ik het onaangename toch aan het nuttige heb gekoppeld en dat ik chantal zo heb kunnen overtuigen
7319638 trouwens als dit nu van rik en chantal is waarom heb jij dan nog steeds een sleutel
7319639 je weet dat ik altijd gek ben geweest van deze plek de zomers met pa ma en wij drie n hier op dit appartement waren heerlijk ik had nog eens zin in pure nostalgie en eigenlijk heb ik ook een congres in oostende
7319640 een congres ben jij dan toch geworden wat je altijd al wou
7319641 dan is er toch nog iemand in de familie die geworden is wat hij wou
7319642 en jij wat is er van jou geworden ik heb je nog vaak proberen te bereiken maar ik wist echt niet waar te zoeken ik dacht dat jij als topmodel wel ergens op de catwalken in alle europese modesteden zou staan maar ik heb je geen enkele keer in de media gezien
7319643 dat komt omdat ik de klein was om model te worden net een tikkeltje te klein en dus bye bye droom heb je echt geprobeerd om nog contact met mij te zoeken nadat ik van huis ben weggegaan nadat moeder enkele maanden dood was en er met pa geen huis te houden was die man stortte zich alleen maar op zijn werk en verwaarloosde zijn kinderen vooral dan zijn dochter zijn zonen kregen alles wat ze wilden zijn zonen mochten hun dromen waarmaken rik zou specialist worden maar het is uiteindelijk maar een gewoon doktertje geworden en jij jij droomde ervan om advocaat te worden en wilde het zelfs tot rechter gaan schoppen ik ben er zeker van dat jij dat nog zal bereiken en ik ik wou model worden maar pa vond die droom niets voor de familie koninckx hij wilde niet dat zijn dochter een ordinair topmodel werd
7319644 nadat ik van huis ben weggegaan ik heb enige tijd op straat gezworven maar wees maar gerust af en toe dronk ik mij wel ladderzat tussen de clochards of de krakers maar ik heb nooit drugs genomen toen ik besefte dat mijn leven zo niet meer verder kon ben ik net op tijd uit de goot gehaald en zo ben ik
7319645 ik heb al die tijd in een club gewerkt een nachtclub the blue lagoen zegt je dat iets
7319646 maar ik moet er wel eerlijkheidshalve bij zeggen dat ik sinds kort samenwerk met een toch wel gekende en uitstekende advocaat en dus vooral in de omgeving van kortrijk vertoef maar om nu verer te gaan op jouw verleden wat deed jij daar in die club stond je achter de bar
7319647 en niet alleen op de bar ik heb aan palen gehangen en het bed gedeeld met honderden mannen allemaal voor het geld pa wilde mijn dromen niet waarmaken en vond mij ordinair wel ik heb aan mijzelf bewezen dat ik ontzettend ordinair was ik vond het best nog te doen af en toe knop omdraaien verstand op nul zetten en daarna cashen
7319648 dat topmodel worden heb ik al lang geleden opgeborgen maar intussen heb ik wel andere ambities gekregen misschien vandaar ook dat ik uit die club ontsnapt ben
7319649 ja je denkt toch niet dat ze je zomaar uit dat milieu laten gaan als advocaat moet je vast wel al met criminele individuen te maken hebben gehad niet
7319650 euhm eigenlijk ben ik meer gespecialiseerd in financi el recht en hou ik mij voornamelijk samen met mijn vennoot bezig met faillisementen maar ook echtscheidingen
7319651 goed om een lang verhaal kort te maken ze laten je niet zomaar gaan uit hun club zeker niet als je genoeg opbrengt in het beste geval verkopen ze je aan een andere club en dan is het maar te hopen dat jouw nieuwe bazen geen rotzakken zijn die je alle dagen in elkaar slaan
7319652 eindig je onthoofd in het kanaal of onder de grond
7319653 oh mijn god en weten zij dat jij ontsnapt bent
7319654 als ze het nu nog niet weten dan zijn ze nog een grotere idioten dan ik al dacht snap je nu waarom ik hier ben ik leef hier ondergedoken en hoop maar dat de storm zelf overwaaid dat ik misschien iemand vind waardoor ik mij kan vrijkopen uit de club want zoiets gaat soms ook het gebeurd wel eens dat n van de klanten verliefd wordt op n van de meisjes die kan dan met de baas of n van zijn handlangers onderhandelen waardoor het meisje van hem kan worden die bedragen zijn meestal schandalig duur zodat die klantjes dat toch nooit kunnen betalen en dan investeren ze maar om meer met dat meisje naar de wipkamers te trekken
7319655 daarom dacht ik nu jij hier toch bent misschien kan jij mij wat sponsoren om mijzelf vrij te kopen ik zal rik ook wel wat geld te leen vragen hij kan me dat niet weigeren
7319656 je wil het echt wel gaan maken in de mode
7319657 niet zoveel maar ik weet wel dat dit bijzonder sterke tekeningen zijn ik zou deze eens moeten voorleggen aan een cli nt van mij hoogstwaarschijnlijk ziet hij ook wel iets in je ontwerpen
7319658 dat wil zeggen dat ik bereid ben om je te helpen om jouw droom te verwezenlijken nu ik je eindelijk na al die jaren terug gevonden heb we hebben nog zoveel tijd samen in te halen
7319659 ik ben een moordenaar een dubbele moordenaar een moordenaar van onschuldige slachtoffers onschuldige mensen mensen die te ver zijn mee gaan in mijn leven
7319660 oh niks gewoon een beetje praten en waarover praten meisjes van onze leeftijd jongens toch
7319661 als er n ding is wat ik zeker niet met jou wil bespreken dan zijn het wel jongens
7319662 en jij hebt de situatie alleen maar erger gemaakt door meteen naar lori te lopen kreng
7319663 kreng kreng ik ben misschien liever een kreng dan een
7319664 dan een slet heel mooi van je om je vriendinnetje haar vriendje af te pakken je zit hier vast niet voor niets je bent misschien al aan het bedenken wie je volgende slachtoffer is welke jongen zal je nu eens van zijn vriendinnetje afpakken pol
7319665 ik ga je een voorstel doen een voorstel dat je niet mag weigeren doktertje want als je dat wel doet dat zal je andere prinsesje ook wel eens op een onverklaarbare wijze in het ziekenhuis kunnen belanden
7319666 ik moet nog een passende straf voor je bedenken maar om te beginnen
7319667 een passende straf je hebt mij anders al genoeg de stuipen op het lijf gejaagd eerst die ontvoering van yasmina ik die bijna van een rots was gevallen en daarna die opsluiting in de kelder
7319668 en jij noemt dat een passende straf voor het afnemen van mijn vriendinnetje en het inbreken in mijn kluis in de eerste plaats wil ik al mijn geld terug
7319669 net wat ik dacht maar dat kan mij geen ene moer schelen ik wil mijn vijfentwintig duizend dollar terug
7319670 ik heb dat geld anders wel met jouw ex vriendinnetje gedeeld ere wie ere toekomt zonder haar was het mij niet gelukt om jouw kluis te kraken
7319671 ex vriendinnetje correctie het is vriendinnetje dat jij dat geld gedeeld hebt is trouwens jouw probleem en niet het mijne ik wil vijfentwintig duizend dollar terug dat jij dat geld verspeeld hebt kan mij niets schelen ga dan nog een gokje wagen ofzo
7319672 ik wil mijn geld terug met vijfduizend dollar intrest erbij
7319673 moet ik jouw strot voorgoed toeduwen misschien dan kom je er wel gemakkelijk van af niet
7319674 zorgen dat ik mijn geld terug krijg je krijgt daarvoor n week gehoord e n week als ik dan dat geld niet heb dan gaat er met jouw verpleegstertje iets ergs gebeuren
7319675 jij hebt yasmina hier toch ook in betrokken je krijgt n week als je dan dat geld niet hebt dan kan ik niet garanderen dat jouw verpleegstertje nog in het ziekenhuis zal liggen zal ik alvast een plaatsje in het mortuarium voor haar bestellen en daarna misschien ook voor jou maar eerst ga ik je laten boeten pijn zul je voelen nu onder mijn ogen uit en vergeet onze andere afspraak niet ik wil jou hier niet meer zien jij blijft uit de buurt van yasmina weg verdwijn we zien elkaar binnen een week
7319676 waar ben je ik maak me zorgen dikke kus diane
7319677 ik ben op weg naar huis en zal daar op je wachten laat je snel iets van je horen knuffeltje diane
7319678 wie er begonnen is kan me op dit moment niets schelen alletwee naar mijn bureau onmiddellijk
7319679 mevrouw kendy komt u ook even mee naar mijn bureau ik moet een hartig woordje praten met deze meisjes en ik zou u er graag bij hebben
7319680 dit is hopeloos we krijgen deze pati nt er nooit meer door
7319681 juffrouw sterkx laat mij n ding duidelijk zijn ik stel hier de diagnoses en ik neem de beslissingen
7319682 onze patient lies onze patient geef mij het hechtingsmateriaal en zorg ervoor dat dat extra bloed hier snel is waar ligt die bloedbank trouwens in timboektoe
7319683 goed maar blijf de parameters in het oog houden een extra verpleegster zou geen al te grote luxe zijn want dit is hier een puinhoop
7319684 hoe is zoiets kunnen gebeuren ik weet al dagen niet waar hans uithangt waarom moest hij nu weg ik had hem nodig ik had zijn steun nodig al die rotjournalisten sorry zusje voor mijn deur en ik moest maar alles proberen op te lossen ik weet zelf niet waarover het gaat
7319685 dus jij gelooft alles wat er in die krantjes staat
7319686 oh ja juist jij bent ook zo iemand die er van geniet om andere mensen in de problemen te steken
7319687 zusjes rustig aan het is nu niet het moment om ruzie te maken
7319688 je hebt gelijk de gezondheid van hans is nu het belangrijkst
7319689 we moeten rustig blijven en elkaar vooral geen verwijten maken iemand koffie
7319690 informeer intussen ook eens aan de balie ik besterf het haast van de zenuwen
7319691 wat komen jullie hier doen ik kan het net zo goed aan jullie vragen
7319692 tanja hou je mond dat mens hoeft echt niet te weten wat wij hier doen
7319693 heb ik dat recht niet om dat te weten ik ben niet zomaar een mens ik ben jullie moeder
7319694 het is al ok blijkbaar maakt het toch niet uit wat ik zeg ik heb misschien vreselijke dingen gedaan in het verleden
7319695 je hebt inderdaad verschrikkelijke dingen gedaan en je hebt als onze moeder dingen laten gebeuren die je niet had moeten laten gebeuren
7319696 jij hebt anders ook vreselijke dingen gedaan in het verleden
7319697 moeten wij echt alles uit het verleden weer oprakelen dat monster wat mij zoveel leed heeft aangedaan is er niet meer en dat jij
7319698 dat jij het al die tijd wist maar er nooit iets aangedaan hebt dat ik zal ik je nooit vergeven
7319699 ik ik wist niet wat je vader met je deed ik ben het pas te weten gekomen de avond voor dat de avond voor je broer je vader van de trappen duwde
7319700 stop ermee we zijn hier niet voor het verleden maar voor hans moeten wij nu echt ruzie maken terwijl hans terwijl mijn man daar in die operatiekamer ligt te vechten voor zijn leven
7319701 ik denk dat het inderdaad beter is om op dit moment geen ruzie te maken ik wacht buiten wel tot de wonde aan douwes vinger gehecht is
7319702 ik ga ook naar buiten ik heb dringend frisse lucht nodig
7319703 waag het niet om achter dat mens aan te gaan
7319704 misschien wordt het wel eens tijd om naar haar verhaal te luisteren
7319705 ik ga trouwens niet achter julia aan maar ik denk dat griet de nodige troost kan gebruiken nog n ding koen al die jaren ben ik bij mijn moeder weggebleven al die jaren heb ik jou gesteund om wat jij met pa hebt gedaan ik heb er nooit spijt van gehad maar ik heb wel spijt gehad dat ik ma heb laten vallen misschien wordt het tijd dat we dat terug goed maken
7319706 doe toch wat je niet laten kunt maar denk maar niet dat ik dat mens ooit zal vergeven en ik denk dat ons griet dat ook nooit zal doen
7319707 mag ik vragen aan meneer om het hier iets rustiger te houden dit is hier nog altijd een ziekenhuis
7319708 met wie moet ik trouwens nog ruzie maken iedereen is hier weg
7319709 dat zal ik doen mevrouw de verpleegster is er al nieuws over hans
7319710 nog geen nieuws maar ik kan voor u wel eens informeren
7319711 ik ben ook heel blij om jou te zien hoor en laat dat held van jou er maar af
7319712 waarom zou ik dat doen jij bent toch degene die mij uit de brand hebt gehaald ik snap trouwens nog steeds niet hoe die chalet ineens vuur kon vatten
7319713 volgens de brandweer is er een vat met brandbaar spul in de fik geschoten dat moet dan gebeurd zijn kort nadat wij die chalet zijn binnen gegaan om yasmina te redden iets wat trouwens jouw idee was weet je dat ik daar fier op ben zonder jou snelle reactie was die vrouw omgekomen
7319714 tja mijn snelle reactie die had ons ook anders wel bijna het leven gekost gelukkig was jij er toen
7319715 ik niet alleen net als jullie ben ik een tijdje bewusteloos geweest maar mijn hulpkreet heeft wel effect gehad
7319716 hoezo ik dacht dat jij ons beiden uit die brand hebt gesleurd
7319717 ja ik heb jullie inderdaad naar buiten gedragen maar ik niet alleen er was blijkbaar een jager die mijn noodkreet heeft gehoord die man heeft niet geaarzeld en is de brandende chalet binnengelopen hij heeft yasmina los gekregen van die stoel vervolgens heeft hij mij weer bij bewustzijn gebracht en samen met hem hebben we jullie buiten gekregen iets wat niets te vroeg was want seconden later heeft het dak van de chalet het begeven
7319718 oh dan moeten we die man wel dankbaar zijn wie is hij
7319719 ik weet alleen dat het een jager was ik heb hem na de reddingsoperatie niet meer terug gezien ik ben toen weer buiten bewustzijn geraakt en ik ben pas weer bijgekomen hier in het ziekenhuis
7319720 misschien weten ze in het ziekenhuis de gegevens wel we kunnen hem op zijn minst een kaartje sturen niet
7319721 we kunnen het hier natuurlijk altijd eens na vragen die man is als ik mij niet vergis ook naar hier gebracht met een ambulance want hij had enkele oppervlakkige brandwonden aan zijn handen toen ik daarnet naar hem vroeg in mijn beste frans bleek dat hij het ziekenhuis alweer verlaten heeft
7319722 jij ziet er anders ook best schattig uit met die pleister op je hoofd en je hand in het verband
7319723 we mogen van geluk spreken dat we er zo goedkoop vanaf gekomen zijn yasmina heeft minder geluk gehad zij is met ernstige wonden naar het brandwondencentrum gebracht
7319724 van zodra we hier weg zijn wil ik haar eens gaan opzoeken ook al kennen we haar niet ik voel mij toch op n of andere manier verbonden met haar
7319725 we hebben hetzelfde meegemaakt dat zal die verbondenheid wel wat verklaren
7319726 euhm ik moet toch nog enkele dagen blijven maar ik heb al gevraagd of ik niet naar langevroeg kon worden overgebracht ik wil in de buurt van mijn opa zijn hij heeft het zo druk in de tea room en zal na alles wat er gebeurd is ook wel regelmatig bij mij willen vertoeven dat het mij handig leek om dichter bij huis in het ziekenhuis te liggen weet hij trouwens al wat er gebeurd is en je vader weet die het al en hoe heeft hij gereageerd
7319727 niets bijzonders meisje ik ben gisteren flauwgevallen nadat ik hier ben aangekomen mijn bloeddruk stond wat hoog en mijn benen voelen nog wat licht aan maar vanaf morgen is jouw bompie weer helemaal op de been
7319728 wat zit ik hier eigenlijk te doen een krant raakt niet van zichzelf geschreven hoor of weet u dat niet
7319729 wat jij hier zit te doen lijkt mij anders wel duidelijk genoeg
7319730 oh ja eerst sluiten jullie mij uren op en in een vieze vuile cel naast de cel van n of andere schreeuwende gek en nu willen jullie nog
7319731 nu willen wij wat wij willen dat je meewerkt en alles verteld over je informant
7319732 wat heeft willy simons jou verteld vlak voor zijn dood
7319733 oh la die ondervragingstechnieken bij de politie zijn er ook niet op verbeterd
7319734 we kunnen je ook terug naar je cel brengen maar ik veronderstel dat meneer de journalist nog veel werk heeft
7319735 vertel ons dan wat we willen weten en je kan terug naar de redactie
7319736 alsof jullie mij zo gemakkelijk zullen laten gaan jullie zijn net als pitbulls eens jullie iemand vast gegrepen hebben laten jullie niet los
7319737 heb ik geen recht om de privacywet en het journalistengeheim in te roepen
7319738 ik denk het niet van den eynde wie a zegt moet ook b zeggen jij hebt informatie die ons kan verder helpen dus willen wij die informatie kennen
7319739 goed goed maar op voorwaarde dat er niets van dit gesprek uitlekt en dat jullie mij daarna laten gaan
7319740 dat doe je eigenlijk wel je weet toch dat je niet overal zomaar kan binnenkomen we zijn hier met een ondervraging bezig
7319741 oei oei het gaat precies niet goed tussen de politie
7319742 agent molants ik neem de ondervraging verder af samen met michielssens
7319743 omdat ik een rang hoger ben dan jij en het is toch algemeen geweten dat jouw ondervragingstechnieken niet van de beste zijn
7319744 je moet je beter informeren roussel ten eerste zijn mijn ondervraginstechnieken helemaal niet slecht
7319745 ten tweede jouw ondervragingstechnieken zijn ook niet wat ze moeten zijn hoor of ga je het er weer allemaal uitkloppen
7319746 how neen hoor dan heb ik liever jou als ondervrager
7319747 maar ik dacht dat het net de bedoeling was dat ik hier ging vertellen wat ik wist
7319748 kom roussel het is genoeg geweest wij zijn hier aan het werk als je hier echt wil bijzijn dan kan je de ondervraging verder volgen van daar
7319749 als je klachten hebt dan moet je maar bij onze commissaris zijn
7319750 eens zien of we er nu iets uit gaan krijgen
7319751 daar heb ik mijn twijfels over maar we doen ons best
7319752 toch al eventjes het geschreeuw was even gestopt maar is nu weer opnieuw begonnen hij heeft niet alleen maar tegen de deur zitten trappen maar heeft ook al met zijn hoofd tegen de muur lopen bonken
7319753 afkickverschijnselen denk ik misschien is dit wel het juiste moment om hem te ondervragen kan je hem uit zijn cel laten halen en naar boven brengen
7319754 kan dat niet even wachten ik moet dringend naar het toilet
7319755 ik weet dat jullie allemaal zo snel mogelijk weer aan het werk willen vooral jij dokter hofman maar iedereen blijft een kort ogenblik hier want ik heb iets belangrijks te melden
7319756 dat is er natuurlijk ne van de inspectie die heel dat boeltje hier komt controleren
7319757 oeps dan zal de eerste indruk van die de praetere niet zo goed zijn
7319758 als ik jullie gerust kan stellen frank werkt niet bij de inspectie
7319759 nog even geduld dokter hofman als ik hier niet voortdurend onderbroken zou worden dan zou ik mijn uitleg allang gegeven kunnen hebben
7319760 inderdaad koen inderdaad met de nodige trots mag ik jullie voorstellen aan jullie nieuwe collega frank de praetere
7319761 goed welkom in ons team nieuwe collega een uitgebreidere kennis maken zal ik nog wel met je houden maar nu moet ik echt mijn blaas staat op springen
7319762 om nog even een korte toelichting te geven frank is al enkele jaren arts en heeft voordien in antwerpen gewoond en gewerkt juist niet
7319763 ik ben vijfendertig jaar gescheiden en heb n dochter van vijftien jaar ik bijt niet dus wie nog vragen heeft moet ze maar stellen ik hoop dat we goed gaan kunnen samenwerken maar ik denk dat dat geen probleem zal zijn
7319764 nu jullie kennis hebben gemaakt met jullie nieuwe collega denk ik dat het stilaan weer tijd wordt om aan het werk te gaan
7319765 er zijn anders op dit moment geen pati nten in de wachtkamer
7319766 geen pati nten nu ja er zijn nog andere taken te verrichten cisse jij maakt de ambulance proper want een urgentie kan op elk moment van de dag gebeuren
7319767 goed zo jij houdt je dan maar verder stand by net zoals iedereen trouwens maar jullie blijven hier niet aan de balie staan ik stel voor dat jullie je in groepen verdelen en zowel de operatiekamers als de onderzoekskamers een grondige opruimbeurt geven
7319768 voor jou verleyen en voor juffrouw somers is er een andere taak jullie mogen de medicijnenkamer checken en verder aanvullen bea leg dat roddelblaadje met die kruiswoordraadsels maar aan de kant ik zou graag willen dat jij meneer de praetere
7319769 ik zou graag willen dat jij frank naar de personeelsdienst brengt en hem ook de nodige spullen bezorgd hup allemaal aan het werk
7319770 dat hoef je toch niet steeds te vragen jij stoort nooit welk nieuws
7319771 met mijzelf is alles goed en met annie gaat het elke dag een beetje beter het vertrek naar portugal komt steeds dichterbij en karel je kan niet geloven hoe ik daar naar uit kijk bijna alles is hier afgehandeld ik zeg wel bijna want er zijn nog een paar dingen die het vertrek wat tegenhouden
7319772 een paar dingen of eerder iemand ligt je vrouw weer dwars
7319773 dominque och die is stilaan aan het bijdraaien al zijn er wel nog enkele belangrijke zaken omtrent de scheiding die moeten geregeld worden alvorens te vertrekken ik ga je echter niet met mijn echtelijke problemen lastig vallen ik heb nieuws voor je over de opvolging
7319774 ik heb een brief ontvangen van de raad van bestuur maar voor ik het daarover wil hebben wil ik je zeggen dat je je niet teveel zorgen hoeft te maken over de opvolging ik heb met mari n gesproken en de algemene directeur heeft beloofd om jou kandidatuur te steunen en als het moet zelf te lobbyen bij enkele leden
7319775 mari n gaat mij dus helpen dat is tenminste positief nieuws al blijft er natuurlijk leo koninckx die voor zijn zoontje zal proberen zoveel mogelijk mensen aan zijn kant te krijgen
7319776 ja maar dat is wat wij ook aan het doen zijn met de hulp van mari n we kennen mari n nu toch al een tijdje en dat is een heel bekwame mens
7319777 ja dat andr van aanpakken weet dat weten we al langer dan vandaag ik denk dat ik hem mijn kandidatuur nog eens grondig moet toelichten zonder de overige leden van de raad van bestuur erbij
7319778 ik zou je alleszins goed voorbereiden en op voorhand al eens langsgaan bij andr is zeker geen slechte zet
7319779 je had toch een brief gekregen over de raad van bestuur wat stond daarin
7319780 wel het zit zo de raad heeft nu officieel de twee kandidaturen goed gekeurd en dus is het tijd om binnenkort met de definitieve selectie te beginnen jullie moeten binnen enkele dagen op gesprek bij de voltallige raad en daarna zullen zij bekijken wie van jullie twee het meest in aanmerking komt om mijn opvolger te worden
7319781 zou ik ook een glas kunnen krijgen alstublieft ik heb dorst
7319782 gaan we nu niet moeilijk doen en mag ik een glaasje
7319783 martin ik denk dat onze dokter niet goed is uitgeslapen
7319784 jij krijgt geen slok van deze fles ik heb namelijk iets te vieren
7319785 en wat dan wel of mag ik dat niet vragen
7319786 tuurlijk mag je dat vragen want het heeft met jou te maken vandaag vier ik de ondergang van dokter darcy tijler
7319787 oh ben je jouw vriendinnetje nu al vergeten we gaan yasmina een bezoekje brengen ik popel om haar terug te zien en ik ben er zeker van dat jij ook wel benieuwd bent hoe het met haar is
7319788 en geen geintjes want ik ben gewapend en als het moet zal ik niet aarzelen om te schieten
7319789 overgesneden polsen hartslag erg zwak bloeddruk onregelmatig en veel bloed verloren
7319790 gaan de dokters nog lang overleggen die man moet geholpen en liefst zo snel mogelijk
7319791 goed lies en melanie breng deze pati nt meteen naar de operatiekamer
7319792 hey ik ga mijn kersverse collega toch wel een eerste pati nt gunnen ik blijf standby maar ga even een koffie drinken in de koffiekamer als je iemand nodig hebt om je hulp te bieden of voor ik zeg maar wat een second opinion altijd tot je beschikking niet dat ik aan je capaciteiten als dokter twijfel verre van zelfs
7319793 meneer u kan daar wachten als u dat wenst en mag ik het sis kaartje van degene die u net heeft binnengebracht
7319794 och mens het is nu geen tijd om sis kaartjes of weet ik veel wat in orde te brengen
7319795 volgens mij is er iets louche aan dit zaakje let op mijn woorden beatje
7319796 hier het medische dossier als dokter zal jij dat vast begrijpen
7319797 dat ze hier niet had moeten liggen dat het nu wel zo is ligt enkel aan jou het is jouw schuld
7319798 mag ik je er op wijzen dat jullie haar ontvoerd hebben en dat die twee pummels die jij hebt ingehuurd niet goed op haar hebben gepast ik heb die brand niet aangestoken ik heb hier evenveel verdriet om als jij
7319799 de enige die haar hand mag vasthouden ben ik jij hebt voor al die ellende gezorgd als jij ze niet van mij had afgepakt en als je niet samen met haar had ingebroken in de kluis van het casino als jullie er niet met de ganse dagopbrengst vandoor waren gegaan
7319800 yasmina was nooit op het slechte pad geraakt als ze jou niet had leren kennen jij bent verantwoordelijk jij hebt dit allemaal aangericht
7319801 nu moet jij eens goed naar mij luisteren doktertje want ik heb je enkele belangrijke dingen te vertellen in de eerste plaats is dit de laatste keer dat je yasmina te zien krijgt vanaf nu wil ik je niet meer in haar buurt zien
7319802 ik ga je een voorstel doen een voorstel dat je niet mag weigeren doktertje want als je dat wel doet dat zal je andere prinsesje ook wel eens op een onverklaarbare wijze in het ziekenhuis kunnen belanden
7319803 ja je dacht toch niet dat ik niet wist dat sinds jij gevlucht bent uit amerika na al je bedrog dat je niet alleen mij hebt bedrogen maar dat je ook je geliefde yasmina hebt bedrogen met n of ander verpleegstertje uit ziekenhuis waar je nu werkt
7319804 ik heb zo net even met de dokter gesproken en wat hem betreft kan je vanavond naar langevroeg worden overgebracht het transport van izzy is ook voor deze avond geleverd
7319805 ik zit hier al de hele dag bij jullie misschien dat ik haar ook eens moet gaan opzoeken
7319806 het zal gemakkelijker zijn voor jou als ik in langevroeg in het ziekenhuis lig dan kan jij de zaak openhouden en me op de vrije momenten komen opzoeken
7319807 het is er op dit moment inderdaad erg druk zeker nu izzy en jij tijdelijk zijn uitgevallen nog een geluk dat n van de andere medewerkers samen met patje nu voor mij wilde inspringen ik denk er over na om iemand extra in dienst te nemen en dat al zeker tot dat jullie voldoende hersteld zijn
7319808 ja misschien is dat geen slecht idee ik ga alleszins proberen zo snel mogelijk terug op de been te zijn
7319809 zorg jij maar dat je voldoende hersteld de tea room en het personeel is mijn probleem
7319810 waarom vraag je julia niet terug zij deed dat werk toch fantastisch ik begrijp nog altijd niet waarom ze is weg gegaan
7319811 het is toch niet omdat julia nu vaak met douwe optrekt dat je haar niet meer terug in de zaak kan laten komen werken ze moet het natuurlijk ook zelf willen
7319812 ander onderwerp graag maar om af te sluiten ik zal er nog eens over nadenken
7319813 nodig nodig was het niet nee maar ik ben er niet mee begonnen die die tammie heeft alles uitgelokt je moest eens horen wat ze over ons allemaal gezegd heeft om nog niet te spreken over de scheldwoorden aan mijn adres
7319814 ja dat begrijp ik allemaal wel maar moesten jullie daarom
7319815 als zij mij in de modder duwt dan mag ik me toch wel verdedigen zeker of moet ik me gewoon laten doen door dat kreng
7319816 neen dat zeker niet maar ondertussen zit je er wel mee strafstudie en niet n keer
7319817 och die uitbrander van de directrice viel wel mee en die straf die we van suzanne hebben gekregen pfftt daar kan ik wel mee leven
7319818 de decoratie voor het laatstejaarsbal in elkaar knutselen en dat dan nog samen met tammie dat gaat vonken geven
7319819 ben je er mee aan het lachen ja ik heb anders niet alleen mijzelf maar ook u verdedigd
7319820 ik kan heus wel mijn mannetje staan hoor en jij blijkbaar ook je mag nu als straf voor je verdedigingstechnieken decoratie ontwerpen
7319821 decoratie ontwerpen en dan nog met dat kreng ik snap berhaupt niet waarom er nu al dingen voor het schoolbal moeten gebeuren het duurt nog een paar maanden voor het zo ver kon suzanne mij niet gewoon een paar regels laten schrijven ik zie er echt al tegen op om al die avonden te moeten nablijven en dan vooral om langer dan nodig met die trut in n lokaal door te brengen
7319822 snap je het niet onze lerares nederlands en engels heeft jullie beiden een alternatieve straf gegeven juist omdat ze wil dat jij en tammie vriendinnen worden
7319823 denk je nu ja tammie en ik vriendinnen dat zal nooit gebeuren dan gaan ze me wel wat meer uren strafstudie moeten geven en ik denk zelfs dat niet
7319824 och gewoon ik kan me jullie twee al zien in dat lokaaltje hoe jullie samen slingers maken
7319825 we zullen maar naar binnen gaan zeker voor er nog meer sancties volgen
7319826 mevrouw duflou ik zal de droger brengen nog even daaronder en u bent weer helemaal klaar
7319827 pff nog meer klanten ik heb zelfs geen tijd om rustig een boterhammetje te eten
7319828 mevrouw duflou ik kom binnen een halfuurtje terug bij u
7319829 maar mevrouw ik dacht toch ik was hier toch welkom
7319830 goed dan ga ik naar boven is sally thuis ik had namelijk een berichtje gekregen dat ze zich vandaag niet goed voelde en dat ze moest rusten
7319831 sally is inderdaad boven maar jij gaat niet naar boven jij verlaat dit pand nu meteen
7319832 ik wil gewoon even met sally praten dat mocht toch mevrouw
7319833 goed je krijgt vijf minuten en als je dan niet lukt om mij te overtuigen van je goede bedoelingen dan laat je sally met rust beloofd
7319834 meneer petrus we hebben echt alles gedaan wat in onze macht lag maar
7319835 maar wat je dacht zeker die mens wilde uit het leven stappen dus het maakte niet veel uit of hij het haalt of niet
7319836 dat dacht ik helemaal niet met alle respect meneer maar ik heb een eed gezworen en die eed probeer ik ook na te leven ik heb alles geprobeerd om meneer witters te redden
7319837 alles was blijkbaar niet goed genoeg het zal je nog spijten dat je mijn schoonbroer niet hebt kunnen redden dat je hem op je operatietafel hebt laten doodbloeden dat je een gezin kapot hebt gemaakt
7319838 och zwijg gij en jij doktertje van mijn voeten het zal je nog spijten
7319839 dokter de praetere kan u even naar onderzoekskamer drie gaan dokter peeters heeft jouw hulp gevraagd
7319840 bennie luister ik ga meteen met de deur in huis vallen en meteen duidelijk stellen hoe het zit
7319841 dat kan best wel zo zijn maar dan staat er je maar n ding te wachten
7319842 dat ook ja maar ik denk dat dat nog even zal duren ik ga je n keuze geven en die is te nemen of te laten als je er niet op ingaat dan wil ik niet dat je sally nog langer ziet
7319843 mevrouw roossen ik wil echt alles doen om sally gelukkig te maken
7319844 laat dat mevrouw roossen maar en zeg maar annick bennie luister ik ga heel duidelijk zijn ik wil dat je met je criminele verleden en het criminele milieu kapt
7319845 dat probeer ik ook mevrouw annick het is niet gemakkelijk om daar zomaar uit te geraken maar ik doe echt mijn best
7319846 blijkbaar niet goed genoeg die razzia in die discotheek jij zat er toch ook weer tussen niet
7319847 ik wil er echt meekappen ik stop er vandaag mee als jij dat wilt
7319848 dan is het toch niet zo moeilijk als je laat uitschijnen bennie jij studeert niet meer h
7319849 dat kan ik best begrijpen maar mijn tweede voorwaarde is dat je een job zoekt een deftige job
7319850 misschien kan je hier in het sertila complex al eens rondkijken hier is altijd wel een vacature te vinden in het restaurant van het hotel het hotel zelf n van de winkels of n van de caf s de keuze is aan jou maar als ik merk dat je je voeten er aan veegt dan is het onherroepelijk gedaan tussen jou en sally en daar zal ik voor zorgen
7319851 ja inderdaad bennie en ik hebben een verhelderd gesprek gehad
7319852 ma je hebt bennie toch weer niet met een kluitje in het riet gestuurd je hebt hem toch weer zijn vet niet gegeven
7319853 neen hoor meisje integendeel zoals ik zei hebben we een verhelderend gesprek gehad
7319854 la investigaci n sobre la marihuana las actuales restricciones son absurdas
7319855 tipo 1 es decir las que est n absolutamente prohibidas sus compa eras de lista son la hero na y el lsd de modo que los investigadores no pueden ni siquiera comprar semillas de la plantita en cuesti n para experimentar con ellas
7319856 es mucho m s f cil comprar coca na para investigaci n que marihuana la lista comprende s lo a las drogas que se definen como adictivas y sin ning n uso m dico lo cual se vuelve con respecto a la marihuana una verdadera profec a autocumplida
7319857 esta droga es muy dif cil de dosificar correctamente por lo que no es muy recetada por el contrario fumar marihuana produce un muy r pido incremento de los niveles plasm ticos de sus principios activos alcanzando muy pronto la dosis terap utica
7319858 en vista de esto el nico curso de acci n razonable es facilitar a los investigadores norteamericanos por lo menos el estudio de la marihuana para establecer sus posibles usos m dicos gran breta a sin renegar de la lucha contra el abuso de drogas ha autorizado a sus cient ficos a criar distintas variedades de marihuana para realizar con ellas pruebas cl nicas
7319859 de kwaliteit van je tekst meet je niet af aan de reactie van het publiek die tekst moet in zichzelf goed zijn
7319860 its good to be looking at the best and brightest in the state of ohio
7319861 what more could i have done in high school how much more personable could i be
7319862 do you find yourself wondering why your blog is not attracting enough visitors
7319863 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
7319864 then you should have stayed home instead of going to austins
7319865 st tt bush s politik under 95 procent av sin tid
7319866 in his first event since choosing joe biden as his vice presidential nominee barack obama attacked many of joe bidens own positions on national security issues we look forward to the debate between joe biden and barack obama over whether or not senator obama is qualified to be commander in chief unfortunately for americans the one area that is not up for debate on the democratic ticket is their shared opposition to new drilling safe nuclear power and their votes for higher taxes on the middle class
7319867 this is a guy whos used weapons of mass destruction this is a guy whos destabilized the whole neighborhood this is a guy who in a war with the iranians over 800 000 people on both sides were killed this is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world and this is a guy who is in every way possible seeking weapons of mass destruction that case in and of itself ought to be sufficient
7319868 if the president of the united states was saying four years ago clear evidence of mass destruction do we have any choice but to eliminate saddam hussein and the threat
7319869 i still believe that saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction
7319870 i still believe that saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction and that the war in iraq was justified
7319871 statement of senator joe biden on the white houses acknowledgment that iraq uranium assertion was wrong
7319872 i mean look the president had a choice and it was a tough choice when he came when 9 11 occurred he could either listen to the advice colin powell and shinseki and most of the uniformed military and john mccain as well and dick lugar and others or choose the advice of the vice president secretary of state the secretary of defense and others and he chose the wrong advice and this i think we need a fresh start to be able to gain any momentum on this war on terror and i dont think were going to see any change id feel a lot better if i knew that president bush was going to be elected and im not being solicitous if i knew he was going to start to listen to john mccain instead of the secretary of defense because they have totally different no i shouldnt say totally many have very different views of how to proceed and so i think youd see a difference in the way how you prosecute the war in iraq i think youd see a difference in how you dealt with homeland security and i think youd see a difference in terms of the cooperation with other nations in terms of getting the consensus on how to deal with controlling chemical biological nuclear weapons
7319873 i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7319874 lets make clear what the facts are i am a christian i have been sworn in with a bible i pledge allegiance to the american flag and lead the pledge of allegiance sometimes in the united states senate when im presiding
7319875 the muslim brotherhood is an instrument of what i call
7319876 bin laden shared qutbs stark view permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as a righteous defense of an embattled faith
7319877 she is part of an organization that has met with leaders like secretary of state condoleezza rice attorney general alberto gonzales and key bush administration adviser karen hughes under her tenure isna has worked to build understanding and has been supported by the national council of churches and the union for reform judaism which hosted mattson at its biennial conference last year
7319878 our goal is to ensure freedom eradicate prejudice and create a society in which muslims live peacefully and prosper alongside other americans
7319879 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7319880 i am in week three of my campaign away from my family in a dark and dingy tent in st james square until my family has their home and money returned to them i will not leave here the cyprus government which is now part of the eu has shown to me that it does not respect its own laws or the laws of the eu i will not stop until i get justice
7319881 i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life
7319882 i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and i know what its like to be blessed by the opportunities of this great nation so the fact is that we have homes and im grateful for it
7319883 la celeridad es un principio que hay que respetar al m ximo pero tambi n la seguridad en la identificaci n de las v ctimas
7319884 tenemos que estar seguros de que lo que digamos a las familias es la verdad
7319885 american people where obama comes from and what his vision is for the country
7319886 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7319887 it doesnt matter who we pick there isnt going to be any footage or any video of john mccains running mate saying that they would be honored to support barack obama for president because the country would be better off
7319888 he comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships
7319889 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7319890 this could give you an almost infinite number of switches and options for communication

7319894 high oil and gas prices improved deepwater technology and a safe political environment means that we can expect higher drilling activity in the future
7319895 the short term nature of the spiking is not something that you could plan your exploration strategy around
7319896 there is huge potential reward off the west coast of ireland but obviously it is higher risk
7319897 everybody wants a brent crude or a west texas type crude and the irish crude oil certainly in the atlantic margin is of that quality
7319898 we know there is a petroleum system we dont know its extent
7319899 the factors that affect our business are not at all correlated to the short term oil price
7319900 the long term factors which affect our business have not changed in the last two months
7319901 there was a knee jerk reaction not just in the exploration companies but in the oil services as well
7319902 were baffled by the flood of money out of the sector
7319903 everyone knows the fundamentals for the industry are great but the cycle has been changing and youre now in execution mode
7319904 what you see is that some of these companies cannot live up to expectations not because the end market is not so strong but its about good execution
7319905 when youre putting wheat on the ground theres going to be a loss
7319906 they dont ever like to put it on the ground but when wheat is 7 8 or 10 a bushel they sure dont like to put it on the ground

7319909 two or three dollars a ton is the difference between getting a contract or not
7319910 we were concentrating more on the flight than the record
7319911 considering the number of kids we lost im a little shocked
7319912 i think thats the reason why were ranked high respect
7319913 respect to the program our tradition and where weve been its not based on what we have coming back
7319914 im a little shocked that we were ranked that high but im not shocked at where katy and carroll are ranked theyre good football teams
7319915 rankings are good for reading and speculation but itll all be decided on the football field
7319916 were a notoriously slow starting team but its not how you start but its how you finish
7319917 i think if cody can get the ball to a j well get the ball in the end zone
7319918 we want to encourage competitive elections in politics not the medals for gordon culture we have seen in previous years
7319919 it was wrong because it doesnt work in politics you get better by challenging yourself against other people a lot of politics are team games where people have to work together but they play against other teams
7319920 correct the tragic mistake of reducing the competitive element in politics
7319921 for by the grace given to me i say to everyone among you not to think of yourself more highly than you ought to think but to think with sober judgment each according to the measure of faith god has assigned
7319922 do you think that islam limits muslims to fully integrate themselves into a western society like sweden
7319923 yes yes i think muslims can integrate assimilation no integration yes the problem is that christians dont know much about islam muslims know much more about christianity and judaism
7319924 before i left he cautioned me about the growing gulf between young muslims and native swedes many people accuse islam and young muslims have had enough the conflict starts because young muslims want to defend islam they want swedes to know they are not terrorists its ignorance about islam that breeds conflict

7319969 jason groves said great post anon 503 i believe both of those players are in their respective home turf currently pope is by far the highest profile athlete to come to nmsu im also confused why any university remains so loyal to an athlete when they obviously dont feel the same way but you look at popes nba potential and i guess it makes sense that they give him a little more freedom to take care of whatever he needs to take care of the bottom line about pope though is he is a solid student and hes their best player so from a student athlete performance wise hes been ideal its only during the offseason where his focus might start to focus back east
