7390000 so far it is not clear for us why the coalition conducted the air strikes
7390001 once again the enemies of islam have stained their hands with the blood of innocent people we the muslim nation will not accept their apologies this time
7390002 the afghan government has frequently emphasised not harming civilians but unfortunately it has not been listened to very well
7390003 the concern is that the government and international community will lose the credibility of the afghan people
7390004 putting up a tentage for a weekend event can cost up to s 11 000 to s 12 000 so you are now able to exploit and take benefit from such a facility
7390005 you get what you pay for i wont shell out a lot of cash for things like flip flops socks and even sometimes panties those h amp m booty shorts are 3 for 10 and super cute then there are those items which deserve more than a few pennies tossed their way for this girl
7390006 we cant evacuate the large cities during the entire conversation abrams spoke of himself as an israeli but we can give the palestinians a 100 percent equivalent he the crown prince said within a second thats fine ill never forget that statement
7390007 they say that the arabs dont miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity
7390008 im telling you that we dont miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity
7390009 i first visited israel in 1972 when i came on a united jewish appeal mission after two days of being there on the beach in netanya i called my wife and said honey were going to sell the apartment and move to israel the next year we sold our house and moved to netanya
7390010 israel will never give up the temple mount to the palestinians or anybody else its too holy for us but we can give sovereignty to god and the nations of the world we cant give it up but we can share make no mistake no right of return not even for a single palestinian once you open the door israel will never be israel
7390011 i guarantee you its much more secure to have the enemy on the other side of the border if there is an enemy than to have him inside
7390012 we have to be brave enough to walk into peace
7390013 it takes bravery to go into war it takes bravery to go into peace roosevelt said it so well the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
7390014 i dont know its a politically courageous move to go against 10 000 fanatic jews theyre very vocal and strong and violent youve just got to bite the bullet and do it
7390015 the palestinians want their own homeland we cant have it if they cant have it there is a point where the occupier becomes the occupied
7390016 24 kyrgyz 52 iranians one turkish national two canadians three kazakhs and one chinese
7390017 everywhere around the site there were body parts of the unfortunate passengers you could hear screams and moans there was a horrible stench of burning bodies
7390018 our three telephones were calling incessantly people were crying could not speak yelled at us demanding to know how we allowed such a tragedy there were children there young sportsmen and their parents grief was overwhelming
7390019 people were kissing what remained of their loved ones even we who should be used to anything could not look at this and turned away not to begin crying too
7390020 the boeing was produced in 1979 was in good condition was checked a month ago and had an extended warranty
7390021 mostly the passengers have combined injuries burns broken bones and bumps
7390022 its hard being young in this league and coach knows that he just wants to encourage me and remind me that this is the time to get better
7390023 we knew that everyone knew that it just was a thing where most people it doesnt affect it wasnt affecting me so if nothing is broke you dont fix it then something happened in practice that second day the disc started moving and that caused some problems
7390024 probably three four years ago ive known for a long time
7390025 saya melihat banyak aparat yang masuk dalam ruangan ini bisa memberikan ketakutan kepada para saksi
7390026 weight loss is important for all patients who are obese or overweight
7390027 even if one loses a small amount of weight it definitely improves your risk factors and ones overall health but not all obese people are at the same degree of risk
7390028 theres a large degree of heterogeneity in the metabolic consequences from the same amount of body fat
7390029 and i think for a certain subset the cardiovascular risks may not be as big as we thought
7390030 from a practical standpoint i dont think it changes our mantra at all
7390031 the idea that there are those who are obese and metabolically healthy appears to be true but its not a majority
7390032 and are these people really going to be healthy over the long haul were not sure
7390033 even if there is not a cardiometabolic effect obesity affects a persons life in so many ways
7390034 its not so much what we weigh its where we weigh
7390035 theyre not used to a physician coming at them with a tape measure
7390036 there are people in my practice who have a bmi of 25 to 30 who are actually very active and very fit
7390037 theyre quite healthy and they just cannot get the weight down its fine to keep active and not to get to hung up on just the weight
7390038 the obese without cardiometabolic risk factor clustering and the normal weight with cardiometabolic risk factor clustering
7390039 theres not enough primary care providers for the demand but what we see here is that theres also competing needs they have jobs
7390040 theres a cultural sense that i dont have to see the doctor on a regular basis because i feel ok
7390041 spanish language media help immigrants socially adapt to their new home country and learn how our systems work or dont in the case of health care
7390042 the impact of immigration on health insurance coverage in the united states 1994 2006

7390045 always remember that in addition to 8 hours for work there are also 8 hours for mischief
7390046 medicare doesnt cover all of the issues that a commercial population would have to deal with
7390047 a state medicaid agency is permitted a right to review prescribed treatment but it is not supposed to be using that as a means to deny necessary treatments
7390048 treating physicians are the ones that get to decide this issue of medical necessity
7390049 who are being denied necessary care and with no way to contest the denial they have no recourse
7390050 these are serious medical issues and we need to make sure medicaid patients get access in a prompt way because their lives are at risk without it
7390051 the georgia dept of community health understands the importance of the timely review of appeal cases and recognizes the impact the backlog has on our member and provider communities
7390052 the acgme continues to allow 24 to 30 continuous hours and shaving a bit off a shift has no effect
7390053 the u s lags behind other countries in new zealand physicians are limited to 16 hours and in europe 13
7390054 if there is an indication of noncompliance we send a letter and follow with a site visit
7390055 if there is an egregious violation it could mean the loss of accreditation
7390056 some of our research suggests that extended work hours may contribute to a significant increase in fatigue related preventable adverse events
7390057 we need to focus on optimizing work schedules to create a care environment that is safe for patients residents and other health workers
7390058 we need to look at patient handoffs these are difficult given the complexity of patients weve got to be more creative
7390059 the intent of the act was to give physicians a level of comfort and make these difficult end of life decisions go smoothly
7390060 if doctors are going to be second guessing themselves as to whether a patient is truly terminal or if theres a 100th percent of a chance someone can be salvaged it may impede the entire process
7390061 anytime someone says a patient is terminal it could be an issue for a jury now and theres always going to be some expert out there to say someone was salvageable
7390062 although the medical profession is best qualified to determine whether or not a patient is in a terminal condition and likely to die those choices like any medical decision are subject to review to provide a process when those medical decisions are questioned
7390063 boredom is the desire for happiness left in its pure state

7390066 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world
7390067 proposing some broad outlines of what they would intend to do and waiting to fill the details in later
7390068 if health plans dont carry out their promises theyre not going to succeed
7390069 thats not whats going to happen in the real world
7390070 were going to need a lot more physician power than we currently have
7390071 that doesnt mean doctors are going to be compensated fairly for the work that they do
7390072 you cant find a politician who doesnt support the concept of health it
7390073 that is exactly the kind of cultural shift that senator obama will bring to health care
7390074 the senator believes very strongly that we need to work with people not impose upon people
7390075 were very sensitive about not wanting to give that impression
7390076 we need to invest in biomedical research and stem cell research so that were at the leading edge of prevention and treatment and we need to finally pass universal health care so that every american has access to health insurance that they can afford and are getting the preventive services that are the key to cutting health care costs thats what i pledge to do in my first term as president
7390077 i think its time to finally make health care affordable and accessible for every american we need to stand up to the insurance companies and the drug companies we need to bring americans together and we need to pass a plan that lowers every familys premiums and gives every uninsured american the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves
7390078 i do not accept that in the richest nation on earth we have to stand by while 47 million americans have no health care and millions more are on the verge of bankruptcy because of their medical bills my mother died of ovarian cancer in the prime of her life and do you know what she was most worried about in those final months she was between jobs when she was diagnosed and she wasnt sure whether insurance would cover her treatment
7390079 in addition to strengthening the va we should give veterans the option to use a simple plastic card to receive timely and accessible care at a convenient location through a provider of their choosing i will not stand for requiring veterans to make an appointment to stand in line to make another appointment to stand in line for substandard care of the injuries you have suffered to keep our country safe
7390080 were going to offer every individual and family in america a large tax credit to buy their health care so that their health insurance is theirs to keep even when they move or change jobs my plan would allow those who want to stick with employer provided health insurance to do so but i want to give individuals greater choice rather than give small business no choice at all
7390081 there are those who are convinced that the solution is to move closer to a nationalized health care system they urge universal coverage with all the tax increases new mandates and government regulation that come along with that idea but in the end this will accomplish one thing only we will replace the inefficiency irrationality and uncontrolled costs of the current system with the inefficiency irrationality and uncontrolled costs of a government monopoly
7390082 it was the best marathon performance ever given the stakes and the conditions with heat and bright sun
7390083 i could give a bleep i could give a bleep if we screwed up i would tell you we screwed up hey if we said this was 50 50 and we just rolled the dice i would tell you that
7390084 what i told you is what our doctor told me our doctor said this is a new injury
7390085 were not having this press conference based on were running scared or were trying to cover our tracks
7390086 i do not feel my knee right now because i feel my bronze medal right here
7390087 i guess hes not going to like that i didnt listen
7390088 ive won little ones but to me this is a big one
7390089 that was really my whole goal coming in to work the bike as hard as i could
7390090 i went hard from the start on the bike and i felt pretty good in the run too
7390091 what i advise my patients at this point is if they are on proton pump inhibitors for a solid indication like severe reflux that cant be managed in any other way or they are on nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs and have a risk of ulcer complications i would probably keep them on ppis
7390092 we dont fully know if the effects we see in the papers are from the proton pump inhibitor or some other confounding factor
7390093 on the flip side we have very strong evidence that ppis are very helpful for patients who have had ulcer bleeding in the past
7390094 in those patients there is a very strong protective effect of ppis
7390095 the stomach normally has a protective coating to prevent acid related injury but aspirin and other nsaids impair the stomachs ability to form this barrier coating potentially leading to ulcer formation
7390096 furthermore these drugs may themselves cause injury directly to the stomach cells and can impair the ability of platelets to form a plug in the event of bleeding
7390097 if there is a long term effect like bone loss i think that will be very important to know
7390098 we are looking prospectively to see if people develop osteoporosis over time
7390099 in epidemiology you rarely get such strong robust findings this strong association between sleep apnea and increased risk of all cause mortality and cardiovascular risk was striking
7390100 the size of the increased mortality risk was surprisingly large
7390101 in our particular study a six fold increase means that having significant sleep apnea at age 40 gives you about the same mortality risk as somebody aged 57 who doesnt have sleep apnea
7390102 when people have difficulty getting air into their lungs it has an impact on their physical well being
7390103 we know that the desaturation of blood oxygen levels is a stressor
7390104 sleep disordered breathing and mortality eighteen year follow up of the wisconsin sleep cohort
7390105 sleep apnea as an independent risk factor for all cause mortality the busselton health study
7390106 nothing was ever done and i did not realize it was odd
7390107 when i was growing up i had lots of cut knees and there were unbelievable amounts of blood
7390108 its just that women are far more likely to have symptoms during menstruation and childbirth
7390109 mild defects may go undetected and it isnt until the patient is challenged that it is recognized
7390110 the important thing is in patients who have bleeding symptoms pursue a diagnosis of an inherited bleeding disorder
7390111 once i convinced him it was not abuse he sent me to a hematologist
7390112 i owe everything to that family physician he was curious enough to ask
7390113 but for anyone with a bleeding history refer to a hematologist for evaluation to be sure you are not missing something
7390114 we had been waiting for years for guidelines to come out
7390115 the nhf advocated with congress to allocate the funds to research
7390116 we are pleased to see the institute affirm the importance of vwd and the need for professional guidance and education around this disorder
7390117 we are hoping with the guidelines that physicians will think about it and say this is what i can do
7390118 theres a 50 to 80 chance that results will come back falsely
7390119 insist that the lab work goes to a local lab that does the levels on site
7390120 the new nhlbi booklet is the most comprehensive we have
7390121 in hindsight it all makes sense i had many things that pointed to it
7390122 i also hemorrhaged with my tonsils i always have bruises i had a hysterectomy at 32 because of bleeding
7390123 gynecologists dont frequently think of bleeding disorders in this situation
7390124 within 12 hours to a week the levels will fall and there is a risk of delayed hemorrhage
7390125 he wears a medicalert bracelet and has a letter he takes with him
7390126 we were on vacation in the mountains there was a blizzard and my daughter got a nosebleed i couldnt stop it
7390127 now we travel with her medicine and my rule is if i cant stop it in two hours we go to the hospital
7390128 the diagnosis evaluation and management of von willebrand disease 2008 clinical practice guidelines
7390129 focus initial clinical assessment on a personal history of excessive bleeding throughout the persons life and any family history of a bleeding disorder identify the spontaneity and severity sites of bleeding duration of bleeding type of insult or injury associated with bleeding ease with which bleeding can be stopped and concurrent medications such as aspirin other nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs clopidogrel plavix warfarin or heparin at the onset of bleeding

7390146 fighting intensified overnight with battles raging near the towns of datu saudi ampatuan and datu piang all in maguindanao province
7390147 we have done our best to embrace peace but the milf started the hostilities by pillaging villages and murdering innocent civilians in mindanao
7390148 now we are implementing the full force of the law and we will arrest those responsible for the traitorous attacks against civilians
7390149 this is a grim scenario and i dont even want to think about it but if the peace talks collapse then there will be war again in mindanao
7390150 the voice of reason is dwarfed by the voice of hatred and prejudice
7390151 the peace talks are slowly breaking apart and if this continues may god help us all

7390155 joe biden made his second attempt to introduce such legislation
7390156 justice should go ahead now to seek a legislative fix to the digital telephony problem and all parties should prepare to follow through on the encryption problem in about a year success with digital telephony will lock in one major objective we will have a beachhead we can exploit for the encryption fix and the encryption access options can be developed more thoroughly in the meantime

7390161 the fbi could get a wiretap to investigate the mafia but they could not get one to investigate terrorists to put it bluntly that was crazy whats good for the mob should be good for terrorists
7390162 the justice department had the ability to use wiretaps including roving taps in criminal investigations of terrorism just as in other criminal investigations long before the patriot act
7390163 presidents illegal wiretapping program that allows intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on the conversations of americans without a judges approval or congressional authorization or oversight
7390164 i think most americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind of bone chilling information is making its way over the internet
7390165 you can access detailed explicit instructions on how to make and detonate pipe bombs light bulb bombs and even if you can believe it baby food bombs
7390166 the extent to which the first amendment protects such material and its private and commercial distribution
7390167 can withstand constitutional muster in most if not all of its possible applications if such legislation is slightly modified
7390168 have been found in possession of bomb making manuals and internet bomb making information
7390169 what is even worse is that some of these instructions are geared toward kids they tell kids that all the ingredients they need are right in their parents kitchen or laundry cabinets
7390170 we are deeply offended by the gratuitous accusations made against kazaa by witnesses before the committee including ludicrous attempts to associate an extremely beneficial next generation software program with organized criminal gangs and even terrorist organizations

7390175 its very frustrating and confusing its hard to imagine how an hoa would try to dictate what type of vehicle you can drive and park in your driveway
7390176 the high end vehicles that are allowed are plush with amenities and covers on the back it doesnt look like a pickup
7390177 the response was its our belief that lincoln markets to a different class of people
7390178 furthermore one board member told my wife that if we dont like it we can move
7390179 if we had a big hummer that could be in the driveway if we had a lincoln mark lt that could be in the driveway but a ford f 150 cant

7390184 yeah after he was eliminated i guess i was constantly thinking about him too
7390185 its definitely going to be kind of a bridge market something that people can afford but thats still high end definitely want to appeal to department stores and have a really chic aesthetic
7390186 look buy me out ive just had it i dont want to deal with the complexities i dont want to deal with the uncertainties i really just want to take care of patients
7390187 lets let that ride onto the backs of the new congress weve satisfied the doctors which was the pressing issue weve satisfied the complaints and the dme folks which was the other pressing issue were going to let that monkey ride on somebody elses back

7390189 oh i dont have change for a fifty just come back by later and pay
7390190 dear mr barack obama what a coincidence my mom just moved to albuquerque maybe we can go out for dinner when i come into town now that i think about it youre probably pretty busy maybe coffee will do let me know how free you are in october thats when i plan on visiting sincerely whit scott
7390191 i will take you out to dinner on friday i promise
7390192 to be not in the best interests of alpharma shareholders

7390194 we continue to prefer to work together with you and your board to complete a negotiated transaction
7390195 if we are unable to negotiate a transaction we are prepared to take this offer directly to your stockholders
7390196 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7390197 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7390198 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7390199 we expect revenue is up a bit but we are still tallying everything
7390200 there was a little worry because when you drop admission prices by 2 you dont know how that will affect revenue
7390201 we were up about 10 per cent for the midway
7390202 we didnt get the crowds for that like i expected and most of it was local entertainers so we want more people to support that next year
7390203 its just the feeling of being up in the air being able to see what you can see
7390204 they are learning how to fly which is something that not everyone gets to do but there is also the symbolic piece to it getting presented with their wings which is a significant milestone as well

7390207 i started using the mug at work and i received some strange looks until i got a big raise and a promotion that is
7390208 i have an ah hah moment every time i drink out of it i wear two pair of underpants now just as a precaution
7390209 i was skeptical at first but when i poured liquid in it indeed came back out when i simply tilted the mug
7390210 i consider myself to be a down to earth new age type of woman not concerned about appearances and such the fact that my boobs got bigger after using the mug was a nice surprise though
7390211 when i stare at the image of monkmojo long enough i can see my inner child and its smiling
7390212 my spirit guides recommended the mug now they fight over who gets to use it when they visit i placed an order for three more
7390213 ever since ive started using the mug i feel like i
7390214 basically they have to get a kit to retrofit the pump so they can calculate a price over 4 a gallon or they simply cant charge over that
7390215 its at least order of magnitude more important to worry about the demand side rather than the supply side

7390227 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed

7390235 in the u s we have moved into a knowledge economy and the main tool is your brain the best possible aid to that tool is a vacation
7390236 the company doesnt have to give the employees any extra time off and it allows office workers much more flexibility
7390237 ok so its not ideal but if you want time off its the easiest way
7390238 if you can afford to do it id recommend it unfortunately many employees think its a bit strange if they dont have their nose to the grindstone all the time especially if they are funding the vacation themselves
7390239 working the brains neurons by taking up a challenging activity will leave you far more refreshed than sitting at a resort doing nothing
7390240 the chat rooms let me know what to look up where to go
7390241 in real life traders typically congregate and become better traders by sharing knowledge if you put them online theyll chat as well
7390242 this is the loudmouthed ceo with a porsche parked out front and a rolex who is always claiming that hes doing the next big thing
7390243 theres little to be said for working for a paranoid boss if the fears do not make any sense
7390244 if your boss is preoccupied with details rules lists order organization or schedules to the extent that the point of the activity is lost and interferes with task completion then your boss may be obsessive
7390245 if your boss exhibits consistent irresponsibility as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations and a lack of remorse when having hurt mistreated or stolen from another then your boss may be anti social
7390246 a general overview on the oilsands and canadas role in the world of energy in general
7390247 i wont come out with a blueprint for the entire u s energy policy or anything
7390248 just the piece where it intersects the issues of the poorest
7390249 60 people playing the game 24 hours a day since the last ice age 11 400 years ago
7390250 greg thus far you have processed 14 fluid modules the minimum number of shere test points for this investigation was 9 the preferred number is 20 we also have a significant level of success at 16 fluid modules of which we are short by 2 test points
7390251 photos acquired with times corresponding to our ceo daily target list request times are reviewed first and this week included mount rainier not acquired mount etna acquired too cloudy mauna loa hawaii acquired too cloudy andrew forest partial acquisition soft santorini volcanic complex greece acquired still under review slate island impact acquired tunis tunisia acquired still under review libyan megafan to be reviewed algerian megafan to be reviewed and tropical storm fay acquired captioned and released by pao we are seeing improvement in the focus and consistency of your long lens photos please continue with more practice when you can your rare striking view of the southern tip of greenland will be published on nasa gsfcs earth observatory website this weekend your high oblique panoramic view was shot as the iss passed over newfoundland and offers a great perspective the ice field glaciers and topography of part of the earths largest island nice shot
7390252 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7390253 this could give you an almost infinite number of switches and options for communication
7390254 we dont use finger paint on our desks to write notes
7390255 during the latter part of 2006 i had this success with dell but other manufacturers said touch we dont know
7390256 the cost is going to have to come down substantially
7390257 a small business needs to be so conscious of cash flow
7390258 to keep more of the profits for us thats just a good way to be
7390259 due to a decrease in flour we will be lowering our bagel prices
7390260 there was a big big big increase in flour and then it went way back down
7390261 even the regular customers see it and say its nice its a good change because everything else in the world is going up
7390262 we are starting now our goal is to have people moving in by end of next year
7390263 in three years we will see significant completion in four years a substantial portion will be completed and in five years it will be done
7390264 downtown is on an upswing and we can push the momentum up
7390265 we are not working against the momentum as we were 20 years ago when downtown was going downward this time we are working with the upward momentum
7390266 it is a big company that does business in 44 states and they have recognized the potential and opportunity in st louis
7390267 i am thrilled that one of the nations largest and most successful retail developers is coming to st louis
7390268 that will allow people to visually tie the pedestrian areas together from the landscaping and bring all the projects together
7390269 during the second quarter we produced 2 2 million boe per day including an estimated 0 4 million boe per day from our lukoil investment segment
7390270 in the downstream business our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate improved to 93 percent
7390271 we generated 5 4 billion of cash from operations during the quarter and this enabled us to repurchase 2 5 billion of conocophillips common stock fund 3 6 billion of our capital program and pay 0 7 billion in dividends we ended the quarter with debt of 21 9 billion and a debt to capital ratio of 19 percent
7390272 we recently signed an interim agreement with abu dhabi national oil company adnoc to develop the shah gas field in abu dhabi
7390273 elsewhere in the region we approved the continued funding for the development of the yanbu export refinery project
7390274 we are pleased to be working with both adnoc and saudi aramco on world class projects that will help meet the growing demand for energy around the globe
7390275 conocophillips also recently signed a memorandum of understanding with petrobras the leading brazilian energy company
7390276 in north america through our joint ventures with transcanada we plan to expand the keystone crude oil pipeline system and provide additional capacity of 500 000 bpd from western canada to the u
7390277 looking ahead to the third quarter we anticipate the companys e amp p segment production will be similar to the second quarter we expect full year 2008 production will be consistent with our operating plan we anticipate exploration expenses to be approximately 375 million for the quarter
7390278 in our downstream refining business we expect continued negative impacts on market capture due to secondary product margins
7390279 if ryan trades dawson for any combination of players or draft picks he is out of his mind
7390280 within the carbon climate debate we have entered a transition period for these world class coal deposits where there is demand for cleaner diesels and other by products able to be generated through new age coal to liquids technologies
7390281 the latrobes future considering australias increasing reliance on fuel imports and pressures on the use of coal for power generation can slow this global fuel reliance by using coal to liquids technology to produce sulphur free diesels aviation fuel fertilisers and feedstock for other cleaner petroleum products
7390282 monashs intention is to evolve a clean coal project in the latrobe capable of producing 70 000 barrels a day of mainly ultra clean zero sulphur synthetic diesel
7390283 to achieve that volume will require however the mining and gasification of 30 million tonnes of coal a year but that will require a carbon capture and storage capability ccs of 15 million tonnes a year
7390284 that is equivalent to one years operation at the loy yang open cut coal mine or just over half the annual production capacity of the geelong refinery
7390285 however this ccs opportunity could be enhanced if there is a collective approach to using the gippsland basin as a central hub for sequestration a carbon sink for greenhouses gases there are enormous cost savings from co operation that make ccs competitive
7390286 so effectively we convert latrobes brown coal deposits into two new energy streams of clean fuel and gas storage
7390287 arrow has achieved an ebitda margin of 4 33 per gigajoule gj up from 1 03 gj a year ago
7390288 much of this margin growth is due to our exposure to the downstream electricity market through our throughput ownership of the daandine and townsville power stations where prices have been very strong
7390289 arrows investment in the braemar 2 power station continues its stated and well defined strategy of downstream investment to enhance margins on its gas sales
7390290 we now have an international office in singapore and teams in china india indonesia and vietnam
7390291 each asian country that were targeting has the potential to be at least as large as our australian operation within the next seven years with gas pricing ranging from 5 to 10 gj
7390292 we will commence our planned drilling programs in vietnam in november 2008 and hopefully in china before the end of 2008 this promises to be a very busy year for our international operations
7390293 arrow has the largest coal seam gas acreage position in eastern australia and a growing presence in four asian countries working with a leading energy company like shell will serve to make the most of our world class assets and expertise
7390294 shell is extremely supportive of the potential for lng development in queensland this transaction is a significant endorsement of and further step in the execution of our margin enhancement strategy and will facilitate arrows goal to connect its large onshore gas resources with high value and strongly growing international markets
7390295 when those interest rates come down well get a housing construction boom and thats going to be a key driver for the economy but not yet
7390296 it is very expensive up to 25 per cent of the cost
7390297 i would ask the state government to look at the hanks review but then to listen to us because were representing the workers
7390298 assess the affordability of the countys current levels of outstanding debt and its ability to issue additional debt in the future

7390333 from infrastructure to administrative work we have a lot to learn
7390334 beijings way of cooperating with other countries is an experience for all developing countries
7390335 we as a government are committed to taking tough decisions and tough action for the economys long term interest and also for the environments long term interest
7390336 part of that is acting responsibly on climate change and part of that in turn means acting through a pollution reduction scheme
7390337 id say to them as i say to other business that this will not come cost free because if you roll the clock ahead 10 20 years 30 years overall across australia what people are saying is this we have wasted enough time its time to act
7390338 if we fail to act the economic cost to australia will be huge
7390339 id say to our friends in the business community yep were up for a discussion were up for a debate were up for a robust engagement but this is not going to come cost free
7390340 the plan is still to bring senator kennedy in for a short period of time it would be an in and out appearance the source was quoted as saying

7390344 were also seeing the resources sector holding up despite a mixed bag of metal prices overnight
7390345 at this stage the market looks like it may remain relatively well bid by the end of the day but it wouldnt surprise me if we did see some profit taking later on

7390347 we have agreed to launch a joint education training and employment initiative which will come back to us with specific recommendations for action by years end

7390351 the document lays out in detail a plan by telstra management to sideline unions and cut the pay of thousands of field technicians lines workers and other key staff through new job contracts
7390352 the company aims to hold workers pay to below the rate of inflation effectively cutting its wages bill by almost 15 per cent over four years
7390353 for the average technician this would amount to a cut in real wages over time of 7300 a year
7390354 telstra is a prime example of big employers who are behaving badly towards their staff and thumbing their nose at the rudd governments cooperative industrial relations policy
7390355 we expect to see new laws introduced into the parliament very soon to scrap all of work choices and replace it with a fair and balanced industrial relations system
7390356 we have taken the extra step of talking to wholesale employees about whats important to them and that will be reflected in any proposed agreement

7390366 the difference between manganese and iron ore is that instead of having a large deposit with iron ore you generally need within the ten to hundreds of millions of tonnes
7390367 with manganese because its a lot higher value product you dont have to move as much so the logistics arent quite as difficult
7390368 we submitted and we were promised a six month review and feedback it hasnt occurred
7390369 weve been promised a further review of costings until a few weeks ago we were never told that the government believed that our cost estimates were out of wack
7390370 of course well give this iteration a very careful look but i have to say to this point it simply does not stack up

7390378 the market is following on from wall street on friday night and reporting season coming in near enough to expectations macquarie private wealth divisional director martin lakos said
7390379 its pretty much in line with consensus but there are always positive and negative surprises during reporting season and were getting our fair share
7390380 were more than half way through now and the market is starting to refocus on the outlook statements from the companies and clearly the next big thing is when and if interest rates are cut

7390385 childhood is a crucial time when bodies are growing and brains are developing its so important to fuel the body with good nutrition and teaching children smart at a young age is a great idea it starts with the parents serving as the role model

7390404 this is why the green party is encouraging canadians to make giving blood a priority this summer
7390405 i applaud the thousands of volunteers in our country who donate blood but also those who donate their time to help operate donor clinics
7390406 it is thanks to the dedicated staff and volunteers of canadian blood services that we are able to maintain a national blood inventory the increase in demand for blood makes it more important than ever for canadians to give the gift of blood

7390423 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7390424 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7390425 many younger women dont remember or could care less and to these twits go fight your own battles
7390426 the whole idea of a roll call vote could be in flux at this point

7390460 hi i pass by this address on the southwest corner of 11th and t on weekdays a bit after 5 am and later in the morning and i see bunches of folks inside and outside neatly dressed in black pants and white shirts later in the day the placed it shuttered and shaded im usually behind schedule when i pedal by and im a bit embarrassed to ask whats happening there looks like they all work at restaurants but it strikes me as a mini union hall rather than a place serving food and i would take the risk of being late and pull over if there were yummy odors from there can you enlighten me please

7390473 vanessa caught my eye straight away she simply outshines all other girls because of her strong personality i dont know if i believe in love at first sight but i do believe in two people having chemistry straight away
7390474 i dont know what it was with vanessa but we kind of clicked from the very beginning she is not just a lovely girl she is also a sexy and desirable woman
7390475 vanessa is just a wonderful person i can laugh and talk with her and most of all we have loads of fun
7390476 the whole idea of a roll call vote could be in flux at this point
7390477 the clinton people here theyve said they wanted catharsis they wanted that roll call but they may not get it
7390478 they dont want to be blamed for any trouble at this convention
7390479 ill be keeping up a blog with vermonters and ill be very much touching base with the office and doing phone calls from denver but i really think it will help the campaign to be part of the excitement in denver to have the excitement over barack obama and have the excitement over my candidacy in vermont paired together
7390480 itll be close but at the end of the day i think theres a lot more excitement for the democrats this year you keep hearing the word change everywhere you go and you know people are ready for it
7390481 i dont think its a done deal i think its going to be a close race but im hoping that enough people are concerned about the issues to come out and participate and i have a lot of interest in this election so im willing to actually volunteer to help get the vote out as well
7390482 you know jim douglas has won by really substantial margins
7390483 but the president has lost and other republicans have lost so i hope vermonters are very independent
7390484 people tell me hes too close to president bush i dont care i

7390489 unfortunately we had to close down its blowing almost 30 knots out here
7390490 when i saw these big rolling waves and white caps i knew we couldnt do it
7390491 if we have high winds or thunderstorms we cant run the boat rocks we cant load the bikes on its not safe
7390492 just having it open during the month of august doesnt make a lot of sense to us especially with biking more popular
7390493 were looking at a way to knock down the waves with some floating wave attenuators weve hired an engineer to design those and that would allow us to get on and off the docks safely

7390518 energy is the one issue that is consuming all the political oxygen in the congressional races especially the tight races the ones where were in peril and those we want
7390519 this is the issue where were having the daylights beat out of us by republicans and this issue can tip close states this is senator obamas election to win
7390520 if we could change the platform to show us as centrists it would take the wind out of the republicans and give us momentum coming out of the convention but many convention goers are activists they would not support this change

7390552 the river runs 10km in a straight line towards renwick renwick is really at risk its a steep gradient and the river flows fast it took the hawkesbury bridge in the 1994 flood
7390553 id like to see a bit more concrete plan of what happens in this situation even if they have to strike a new rate one way or another we have to get something done its still a public riverbed
7390554 if the river broke on our corner it could go down to renwick
7390555 weve got to be fair we cant expect people in other areas to pay those rates private landowners have ability to do work themselves and some have
7390556 this idea is to use the smallest possible amount of toxin to knock numbers down and then use the vaccine to ensure that the tb cycle is well and truly broken
7390557 the argument is they will work far better together than they would alone
7390558 there is a vaccine available bcg which is the same as the one long used in humans we know it protects cattle against experimental challenge from tb what we dont know is whether it will protect cows from the natural challenge of tb infected possums so this trial is the first ever real world field trial of that
7390559 well use released pigs as judas animals or sentinels as a way of measuring the level at which tb continues to cycle or persist in wildlife
7390560 we could have sold the undeveloped land alone or we can substantially increase our return by building and leasing its not a big project and its not a big risk but it will pay for the cost of developing new carparks without costing ratepayers

7390564 the reason i came to marlborough was that i had heard from my friend who had done pruning before and then i wanted to try it and now im still working here
7390565 i went home for about six months but i really missed new zealand so i came back i came straight back to marlborough to work for steve akehurst
7390566 im still enjoying it because im working on the vineyard for two years and i can see a whole year in the vineyard so its enjoyable seeing what i did and how it helps it grow
7390567 after it i thought i may as well just go home now but all the other contestants were exactly the same
7390568 my speech topic was as the saying goes great wines are made in the vineyard but in this age of technology is this still true
7390569 the girls did fantastically well to lose by one goal to eastern thats our best result against them in the four or so years weve been playing them so weve shown were well placed to take them on in the round robin of the perry foundation national champs
7390570 for a first hit out the girls were a bit nervous but they pitted themselves well against two teams well face in round robin weve now faced one of the easiest teams and probably the hardest so weve taken a lot out of today and have a good idea where were at
7390571 i was startled but it brought home to me what a powerful get out of jail free card mccain had earned by not getting out of jail free so its hard to believe that john mccain is now in danger of exceeding his credit limit on the equivalent of an american express black card
7390572 p o w card if you have any examples a lot of people would like to see them some person saying it on what basically amounts to a blog site does not make it fact
7390573 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
7390574 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous

7390604 this year we are faced with dealing with the high cost of fuel and as such we have taken steps to become more efficient
7390605 one such idea that has gotten ups lots of attention is the dont turn left concept
7390606 in the course of one year ups saved millions of dollars by following this routine in their daily truck deliveries
7390607 why not try it here in fort kent this year
7390608 the sad 27 board members are concerned about the commitment they made to taxpayers
7390609 they want to cut costs where they can without hurting education
7390610 this approach will not only save us diesel fuel it is safe and more efficient
7390611 buses wont have to jockey as cars come in from the left and right driveways and drivers will also have a clear vision of students walking between parked cars and being dropped off
7390612 we would want to put all the pieces of it on the table and then take a look at it
7390613 for the school district it does sound like they are doing what is best and safest for the town
7390614 we are seeing more kids taking the bus this year and as winter nears we will probably see more
7390615 kids like to cruise but with the price of fuel there are only so many hours they can work part time jobs to pay for it
7390616 this is voluntary and the bus drivers are not required to do this
7390617 our transportation supervisor peter saucier told them to do it only if they have time
7390618 from what ive looked at ive seen a better flow of traffic on pleasant street especially at the elementary school
7390619 we encourage parents to have their children utilize the school buses

7390724 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar

7390726 since the case is sub judice we cant comment as of now
7390727 however we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter

7390813 im able to take a laptop home and then do pretty much my entire job at home via the laptop so i might get a little too used to it
7390814 because of the way everything was being rerouted i just figured its easier to get out of here than try and fight it
7390815 it will be hard to get in and out of here you know with vehicles to get materials and things
7390816 nobody wants to come down here and try and fight the crowds
7390817 maybe we just think its going to be crazy and it wont be
7390818 we thought the democratic convention was going to just destroy traffic in boston
7390819 traffic in boston is bad anyway we thought it was going to just be horrendous
7390820 they either took vacation or they worked from home but whatever they did they stayed out of the city and traffic was flowing very well and it was not a problem at all

7390822 have you ever come to the winter carnival there are thousands and thousands of people lots of cars lots of activities
7390823 i dont think that this event is all that different than that
7390824 we dont want them going away we want them actually taking part
7390825 nobody likes to reverse one and ive been involved with some in pretty big situations like that but when you get the call right everyones behind you the media and the teams on the field
7390826 its inevitable that were going to use it as long as its just where home run calls and borderline calls are concerned
7390827 we just have to make sure its a system that doesnt delay the game any more
7390828 i would love to get that record im not going to lie to you
7390829 in the meantime its something i cant control weve got a long way to go and im still looking forward to getting some more opportunities
7390830 im very blessed and very happy all the work i put into it i think its paid off but i dont want to sound selfish its not all about me its about the ball club and winning ball games
7390831 hes a hall of famer and he had 573 homers so he did a lot more in his career than ive done in mine so far
7390832 hes the guy whos got all the power records in our organization so to have my name next to his is pretty nice but ive still got a long way to go before i come even close to doing anything that he did
7390833 maybe when im done playing ill look back on it as a pretty good accomplishment if we won the game it would mean a lot more
7390834 but right now were in a pennant race and were going to need more than just a hundred rbis im going to need to keep driving in runs and helping us win ball games
7390835 we have fun doing it its fun to get new fresh stuff for the kids so we enjoy doing it
7390836 maybe 300 between clothes for the two girls and supplies and backpacks are expensive
7390837 and thats the most important part its all about stability its all about giving kids an equal chance and getting everyone started on the same playing field

7390845 the document lays out in detail a plan by telstra management to sideline unions and cut the pay of thousands of field technicians lines workers and other key staff through new job contracts
7390846 the company aims to hold workers pay to below the rate of inflation effectively cutting its wages bill by almost 15 per cent over four years
7390847 for the average technician this would amount to a cut in real wages over time of 7300 a year
7390848 telstra is a prime example of big employers who are behaving badly towards their staff and thumbing their nose at the rudd governments cooperative industrial relations policy
7390849 we expect to see new laws introduced into the parliament very soon to scrap all of work choices and replace it with a fair and balanced industrial relations system
7390850 we have taken the extra step of talking to wholesale employees about whats important to them and that will be reflected in any proposed agreement
7390851 of course our employees will be able to vote on any proposed agreement
7390852 for the first time many employees may have the opportunity to earn extra money through good performance
7390853 we have promised we will preserve entitlements that are important to our current employees including redundancy pay grandfathering parental annual and long service leave penalties and hours of work

7390856 i was planning on swinging when i got a fastball
7390857 but when i saw rickie weeks take off i just let him take second i hit a split finger and it found a hole
7390858 cameron had a big day five hits and mota came in with the bases loaded and got us out of that jam
7390859 you just had the feeling if we could get out of that jam we could win the ballgame in the bottom half of the inning
7390860 both sides had opportunities and it did seem like the home team was going to win this one because they had the last at bat
7390861 both sides battled and you cant fault the efforts from the guys they hustled all day long
7390862 i think definitely you have to give a lot of credit to catcher geovany soto weve been working pretty well together im comfortable with him behind the plate i think a lot of it is mixing up pitches keeping them guessing
7390863 when he doesnt get behind in the count and throw a lot of balls its tough
7390864 he can throw anywhere from 88 to 91 and kind of sink it he can come with 95 to 97 its just tough to pick up he throws everything from the same arm angle
7390865 we wanted to shorten his stride its a simple little thing getting his hands set a little quicker so his swing is shorter more compact and into the ball
7390866 lou gave me his point of view on what he thought i should change
7390867 i was able to work on it a little bit in the cage but during the game i cant think of stuff like that while im at bat so i wasnt able to fully introduce what he told me
7390868 im getting pitches to drive and im not missing them
7390869 a lot of hard work has gone into this and when it comes together it is something special
7390870 im proud of the way i hung in there and got the job done
7390871 the first thing i was thinking was to get somebody close enough to me so i could touch them
7390872 when you are not a fast runner you have to think of things to get yourself out of bad baserunning
7390873 and i told the umpires just that i have a great deal of respect for that crew but i told them they got that call wrong
7390874 i am not in that situation very often so i told myself to just swing at strikes
7390875 pinch hitting is hard enough for guys who are good at it and i dont have much experience with it i got ready swung that bat and it happened
7390876 i felt its been coming even when i was 123 on the money list i tweaked a couple of things which is mainly taking the bogeys out the last three weeks ive been taking the bogeys out of play
7390877 it was just a case of a blind squirrel finding an acorn i was upset the pitch before didnt hit me ill take it the way it ended
7390878 basically we just couldnt take advantage of the mistakes wolf made today
7390879 im not really concentrating on home runs those are going to happen theyre going to go out sooner or later
7390880 especially with the diamondbacks losing today it moves us closer and we have to keep fightin
7390881 its especially difficult when you give them the first three runs
7390882 at the plate we had the runners out there late in the ballgame but we just couldnt get that big hit
7390883 i was dizzy i was tired but the fastball was there
7390884 he gave up that solo home run which usually isnt a big deal but he got caught with two walks and then that home run
7390885 we did exactly as mother instructed and didnt ask any questions
7390886 at some point in time in all our careers were going to win our last golf tournament and when you win it you obviously dont think thats going to be your last one
7390887 when i won this tournament in 06 i thought i was just going to light it up
7390888 you try to eliminate those thought because those thoughts are counterproductive to winning a golf tournament
7390889 so you battle through those and keep pushing through those
7390890 its fun to be in the hunt but its disappointing not to win
7390891 i was feeling like if i shot 10 under today i could win the golf tournament
7390892 if i get to 13 under that is tough at the end of the day
7390893 everything that you get in this game youve earned whether it be a touchdown a win whatever it is
7390894 in some sense it is satisfying in that light but trust me theres a lot of work ahead and i know that probably just as much as everybody around here theres going to be some ups and downs but youve just got to stay mentally tough and grind through it thats where my mind set is right now
7390895 we feel like he gives us the best chance to win
7390896 hes picked up our system ill have to keep repeating this but its a learning curve for a quarterback in this league hes going to see some things he hasnt seen before but i think matt is the kind of guy who might get fooled once but the next time it comes up hes going to be able to handle it i really anticipate that we wont see the gaffes that a lot of people think
7390897 he just shook it off and said im glad i got that one out of the way in the pre season
7390898 hes got a very good outlook about the game of football hes got a good understanding to play quarterback in this league hes prepared for it hes mature beyond his years and itll be a great season for him to come in and be our leader
7390899 hes going to have his growing pains just like anybody
7390900 you look at peyton manning in his first year he struggled i just hope the fans and the media give this guy a chance hes not going to go out there and be a hall of famer every game this year hes going to have some mistakes and were going to help him out as much as possible
7390901 were going to play against some really good players and theres really good coaches on other teams as well
7390902 so theres going to be good schemes and sometimes were not going to be at our best but youve got to learn from those mistakes and youve got to understand that theyre going to happen and youve got to bounce back from them as quickly as you can
7390903 i said to myself get in the fairway get on the green and give yourself a chance because putting is what i do best
7390904 i knew if i hit it good enough with the way i putt i knew id have a chance
7390905 that putt was a lot more difficult than the one i had in regulation
7390906 it broke a couple feet its a pretty amazing putt to make in a playoff
7390907 its fun to show i can play that i can still make putts under pressure
7390908 there were photographers there and i told them exactly where i was going to go i said right there make sure you wait for me there its just a positive attitude
7390909 they kept telling me push push push and i was pushing to the limit
7390910 that was fun a lot of fun oh my god this is awesome weve been close so often we never lost faith this is great for detroit
7390911 we would not have won this race if helio hadnt driven the wheels off it when he needed to we will keep going and see where we end up at the end of the year
7390912 i think our approach next weekend is the same we go for broke thats the only thing that is going to get us where we need to be
7390913 it was definitely a bad day we lost a ton of points
7390914 this is a race thats very tough unfortunately we got the bad end of the stick i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
7390915 i think if helio wins the next two races we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that
7390916 we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
7390917 im not upset with anybody particularly we just did absolutely nothing right

7390927 a ll projects must stay where they are be it kosovo udi the realization of plans to deploy elements of a us global missile defense system in eastern europe or natos eastward expansion because any striving to complete at any cost by a specific date the realization of what causes rigid non acceptance by partners and threatens a collapse of the established relations will trigger a reaction this vicious circle needs to be broken
7390928 it sounds paradoxical but there was more mutual trust and respect during the cold war there was awareness of the need alongside the wish to deal with truly significant issues for our two countries and the world as a whole

7390978 i have just been told palermo got injured and i am deeply sad
7390979 i was happy to hear about the victory but then i was told about this its terrible
7390980 the reason i came to marlborough was that i had heard from my friend who had done pruning before and then i wanted to try it and now im still working here
7390981 i went home for about six months but i really missed new zealand so i came back i came straight back to marlborough to work for steve akehurst
7390982 im still enjoying it because im working on the vineyard for two years and i can see a whole year in the vineyard so its enjoyable seeing what i did and how it helps it grow

7390985 a poll by the state owned russian public opinion research center suggests that russians consider the united states to be russias greatest enemy
7390986 the study concluded unfortunately the authors provided no link to the raw data so it was impossible to verify their claim that
7390987 a majority of young russians view the united state as enemy no 1
7390988 to reverse the tide of growing anti american sentiment among young russians
7390989 they didnt steal anything so it was so obviously deliberate
7390990 i cant remember what things i have done that would make them do this
7390991 this rally is great fun to drive its like nowhere else in the world
7390992 its been a long time since i drove in new zealand and most of the stages will be new to me but im looking forward to them and i think they should suit us well ive always had a good feeling in new zealand and if things go well we have a decent chance of a good result the most important thing is that our sx4 wrc seems very reliable now so if we stay out of trouble again we can hope to score some points certain parts of rally new zealand are a little bit like finland but you dont need so much power its more a question of carrying the momentum through all the bends and finding a good rhythm
7390993 theres going to be a lot for me to take on board but from what i remember of the rally new zealand i liked it very much
7390994 its the sort of place where you cant force a car you have to drive naturally and let the rhythm come to you in that respect its a little bit similar to sweden im going to try not to make any mistakes and hopefully we should have a good result to show for our efforts

7391000 plus all my homies wanna die call it euthanasia dear lord look how sick this ghetto made us
7391001 we just see it as a way of showing our commitment to look after the environment we gain rewards for our wine from the environment so it is good to give back to it
7391002 they are able to cope with stresses and strains and things that life throw at them much more ably they it blows my mind a little bit because its such a simple concept but it has such a complex positive spin it produces young people who are an asset to the community
7391003 this idea is to use the smallest possible amount of toxin to knock numbers down and then use the vaccine to ensure that the tb cycle is well and truly broken
7391004 the argument is they will work far better together than they would alone
7391005 there is a vaccine available bcg which is the same as the one long used in humans we know it protects cattle against experimental challenge from tb what we dont know is whether it will protect cows from the natural challenge of tb infected possums so this trial is the first ever real world field trial of that
7391006 well use released pigs as judas animals or sentinels as a way of measuring the level at which tb continues to cycle or persist in wildlife
7391007 liberal leader stephane dion believes prime minister stephen harper could be dissuaded from calling a federal election in the next few weeks during a stop in saskatoon on sunday
7391008 this is an invention by mr harper to try to trigger an election before he loses the byelections
7391009 a few days ago he just called a fourth byelection in don valley west its taxpayers money
7391010 dion repeated his earlier claims that harper wants to bypass parliamentary committee hearings into tory scandals and distract canadians from a weakening economy he also said harper would be breaking his promise of fixed election dates every four years
7391011 when hes been going out lately you know your getting a quality start from him

7391016 im a bit of a perfectionist i was just never really satisfied with the material
7391017 i had 150 songs and at that stage i still wasnt happy
7391018 artists change their mind and where they want to go every five minutes
7391019 i just took that long until i was completely satisfied
7391020 when is the right time to make the record and when is the right time to release it
7391021 i never really got a break so there was no rush for my second solo album and plenty of time for me to sit back and relax and take some time for myself
7391022 this is pretty much home now this part of the world
7391023 its a growth period i learnt so much from westlife how to promote and market
7391024 and obviously as an artist i learnt how to sing on stage how to hold a crowd
7391025 when it came to do my own stuff the hard part was out of the way i didnt have to worry about performing the music or worry about anything else
7391026 all i had to do was concentrate on creating the album
7391027 when youre in a band and you make a mistake you have four people coming down on you
7391028 but when you make a mistake yourself youve only got yourself to blame
7391029 doing gigs making albums i think id like to do that for the rest of my life
7391030 i achieved so much with westlife that i want to maintain that success for the rest of my life
7391031 things change you get married you end up having kids youve got to think of the future im still really young
7391032 but as long as i can mosey along and do gigs for the next 10 15 years ill be happy
7391033 i just enjoy plugging along doing what i do but if an opportunity comes along ill have a go
7391034 westlife werent successful there so there was no reason for me to go there
7391035 but it was a new territory a brand new beginning and i decided at the end of last year i was going to do it and ive spent most of this year there

7391045 it is increasingly clear that president bush does not have a strategy for victory in iraq rather he hopes to prevent defeat and pass the problem along to his successor
7391046 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs while leaving the central government in charge of common interests
7391047 fourth the president must direct the military to design a plan for withdrawing and redeploying our troops from iraq by 2008
7391048 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7391049 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7391050 such a person if he would assume the vice presidency post would not serve to improve iraq usa relations
7391051 biden has made his iraq dismemberment plan the centerpiece of his 2008 candidacy

7391055 they could smell the fuel so they didnt waste any time getting out of it
7391056 hed clipped one a bit farther back from there the crash site it hit some more maples and the maples just leaned down and uprooted and from the looks of it cushioned it from any real heavy blow
7391057 shes on her nose up against the trees one pontoon is split right back underneath it
7391058 ive left some guys there because there was quite a bit of fuel leaking
7391059 he came over and brought some water and pop over for the guys
7391060 set the plane straight down into the trees it hung up into a large tree nose down and its nose is resting on the ground
7391061 the doors were jammed they couldnt get out they had to get out through a window they didnt even have a scratch they were just more in shock than anything
7391062 well because she doesnt want us drinking it all so she hides it in her closet
7391063 i acquired this from a friend who got it from a friend
7391064 for reference universe and rainbow are two streets in town that are really close to each other universe was closed and people were being redirected to rainbow its quite the amusing sign i had originally written that people were being redirected to paradise but thats not quite accurate paradise is another street in the area and i have no idea why i thought it was involved whatsoever odds are good that the photo was taken on paseo del norte
7391065 one must learn to love and go through a good deal of suffering to get to it and the journey is always towards the other soul
7391066 she had not known the weight until she felt the freedom
7391067 its important that the centre continues to offer a welcoming place where newcomers are helped and supported so they feel a sense of security and belonging here in marlborough
7391068 it is a great example to the rest of the community
7391069 in the fall of 2002 bush and his white house were engaging in a carefully orchestrated campaign to shape and manipulate sources of public approval to our advantage
7391070 the phony bush lied story line distracts from the biggest prewar failure the fact that so much of the intelligence upon which bush and rockefeller and everyone else relied turned out to be tragically catastrophically wrong
7391071 in my experience the great majority of cases of actual politicization successful politicization are invariably subtle
7391072 the desire to avoid the unpleasantness of putting unwelcome assessments on the desks of policymakers
7391073 false information from the iraqi national congress inc affiliated sources was used to support key intelligence community assessments on iraq and was widely distributed in intelligence products prior to the war
7391074 a source who may have information related to the alleged sale
7391075 a contact with excellent access who does not have an established reporting record
7391076 this unremarkable report was disseminated but because it produced no solid answers there wasnt any urgency to brief its results to senior officials such as the vice president
7391077 in many ways we were prisoners of our own history
7391078 the u s rush to war against iraq marked the worst intelligence scandal in the history of the united states
7391079 he has told you o man what is good and what does the lord require of you but to

7391092 the most overlooked asset of a team because its the most difficult to judge is how well the team operates as a team and not as a bunch of individuals wearing the same uniform

7391094 bloody great fun to see in a theatre full of jumping moviegoers all nervous laughter shrieks and covered eyes rec may well be lacking in psychological thrills but its a gruesome rollercoaster ride that packs more jolts into its economical running time than a wayward electricians entire career
7391095 are the antiwar left prepared to condemn unequivocally russian imperialism
7391096 sure that the church never identifies herself with any particular nation or culture but that she be the church of all peoples to make present among men who are marked by countless divisions and contrasts the peace of god the unity of those who have become brothers and sisters in christ
7391097 she left everything and abandoned herself completely to the will of god to the call of the church and to the demands of her new brothers and sisters
7391098 i do not expect a high place in heaven i will be very grateful to have a little corner where i can love god for all eternity
7391099 the document lays out in detail a plan by telstra management to sideline unions and cut the pay of thousands of field technicians lines workers and other key staff through new job contracts
7391100 the company aims to hold workers pay to below the rate of inflation effectively cutting its wages bill by almost 15 per cent over four years
7391101 for the average technician this would amount to a cut in real wages over time of 7300 a year
7391102 telstra is a prime example of big employers who are behaving badly towards their staff and thumbing their nose at the rudd governments cooperative industrial relations policy
7391103 we expect to see new laws introduced into the parliament very soon to scrap all of work choices and replace it with a fair and balanced industrial relations system
7391104 we have taken the extra step of talking to wholesale employees about whats important to them and that will be reflected in any proposed agreement
7391105 of course our employees will be able to vote on any proposed agreement
7391106 for the first time many employees may have the opportunity to earn extra money through good performance
7391107 mike tilley came to challenger with a clear mandate he has fulfilled that mandate and the board has been considering the right structure for the next phase of the companys development challenger financial chairman peter polson said
7391108 mike has developed a strong senior team and there was no question about succession
7391109 the board looks forward to working closely with dominic during the next phase of the companys development
7391110 this is a very credible result despite the adversity in the market over the last 12 months mr tilley said in a statement
7391111 that we were able to generate a 21 per cent increase in normalised ebit in such conditions is a reflection of the strength of our diversified financial services business
7391112 we believe that the current difficult market conditions will continue to affect the sector for some time to come mr stevens said
7391113 the strategies we have put in place have put us in a very good position in terms of liquidity and capital providing some insulation from the difficulties of the current environment
7391114 together with an intense focus on risk management we are very well placed to manage our way through the cycle and take advantage of opportunities created by the current environment he added
7391115 we remain confident in our pursuit of generating double digit eps growth in the long term
7391116 dominic and i have worked very closely together over the past four years and i have every confidence that he will be an outstanding chief executive mr tilley said financials
7391117 we as a government are committed to taking tough decisions and tough action for the economys long term interest and also for the environments long term interest
7391118 part of that is acting responsibly on climate change and part of that in turn means acting through a pollution reduction scheme
7391119 id say to them as i say to other business that this will not come cost free because if you roll the clock ahead 10 20 years 30 years overall across australia what people are saying is this we have wasted enough time its time to act
7391120 if we fail to act the economic cost to australia will be huge
7391121 im excited but a little nervous i think ill be ok
7391122 were able to come together cry together laugh together and share different things to become better parents
7391123 i breathed a sigh of relief that obama chose biden
7391124 as a longtime admirer of biden and as one who favored him in his brief campaign for the democratic presidential nomination this year im pleased and after some of the goofier speculation rather relieved if one of your criteria for choosing a president is his ability to make smart decisions on important matters then i would say obama in his most crucial decision so far comes out looking pretty good
7391125 biden has much more in the way of a strong and sensible foreign policy than obama which makes the ticket more appealing to those of us on the anti totalitarian left
7391126 it strikes me that obama essentially picked himself 20 years ago joe biden was the barack obama of his day elected to the senate as a whiz kid at 29 biden was young smart talky telegenic and ambitious he had an impressive personal story as well as the possession of a very healthy ego it all came crashing down 15 years later when biden lifted some speech rhetoric from british labor party chieftain neil kinnock now biden is back older wiser and probably seeing a little of himself circa 1988 in the dashing obama
7391127 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs while leaving the central government in charge of common interests we could drive this in place with irresistible sweeteners for the sunnis to join in a plan designed by the military for withdrawing and redeploying american forces and a regional nonaggression pact
7391128 across racial and religious boundaries iraqi politicians on saturday bemoaned democratic presidential contender barack obamas choice of running mate known in iraq as the author of a 2006 plan to divide the country into ethnic and sectarian enclaves
7391129 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7391130 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7391131 the trend in parliament is clearly in a more national direction with political parties coming together across sectarian divides

7391172 i am not surprised in the land of the free you will never run the country if you denounce the greatest threat to our world zionism you have to pander to gods chosen people if you ever want to become president
7391173 and the reason zionism has the power in the first place is because it controls the money supply the central banking fractional reserve banking system it has manage to install in most countries has allowed it to cream a royalty of every shekel in existence and create a system of economy where the only way the economy can even stand still is for people to borrow even more money to pay off the interest on the previous borrowings
7391174 i cant believe people wont believe diana was liquidated the christian zionist western establishment is at war with islam they hate each other does anyone really think the mother of the future king of england was going to be allowed to marry procreate with a muslim they simply wouldnt let the bloodline be as what they as being contaminated in that way and btw i know a few americans that are aware of the way the country is politically hijacked by zionism and are in no doubt 911 was an inside job

7391188 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet

7391195 this lawsuit has nothing to do with joe biden and there is absolutely no truth to those allegations
7391196 it is a business dispute between former partners the suit is baseless
7391197 there was a concern that hunter bidens role as a lobbyist would have an impact on the senators proposed presidential run
7391198 thats what james biden told mr lotito was it true who knows there is no allegation that the senator was involved in any of these events

7391201 what a phenomenal race today the wheel to wheel action was as good as it gets there was really world class competition out there today the racing with romain dumas was incredible as we passed back and forth i guess they ran out of fuel like gil i feel bad for gils team they were so close to winning but well take this fourth win and close in on the point lead very exciting for us
7391202 the last two races have been about fuel and our staff led by duncan dayton and rob hill did another great job of calling the right shot at the end our car was fast all weekend but i got caught some bad traffic and that hurt us david did his usual great charge to get the patr n highcroft acura to victory lane this place is like a throwback to older racing with such fast turns its great for a driver
7391203 we were very close to winning the race today our lowes acura team had a great strategy and my car felt good we had some great racing in the p2 class each race well continue to learn about the acura chassis on these fast tracks we had the lola last year and the new chassis is very good we think we can get better with each race
7391204 we had some problems with the battery and that hurt us a little but the lowes acura was fast today we play a fuel game and i felt luis had a good momentum so he stayed in longer than some of the other acura drivers who switched positions after 45 minutes i decided to save a little more fuel than gil and david or we might have had a shot for the win without the suspension problem at road america we should have three straight podium finishes second feels good
7391205 the xm car was not as fast as i would have liked due to the contact james had in the beginning of the race we lost the front wing we were able to race with anyone in our class until we had to pit late for fuel and tires our strategy came close at the end but the race was one lap shorter than we would have liked another bad break
7391206 the xm car was good in my stint today unfortunately i was racing with sharp and we were passing a ferrari in turn eight i dont know if he didnt see me but he ran into my cars left front we lost a dive plane that hurt the aerodynamics a little bit overall we just missed a bit on our fuel strategy and we had to settle for fourth
7391207 it shows how much racing can get you sometimes we will take a lot from this weekend we learned a lot the whole week we had some problems but team had a great strategy and the car was very good in the race i thought gil was outstanding today too

7391213 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
7391214 the genesis for this was chucks real feeling that this was an unfair position
7391215 ive been looking forward to this winning for sooooo long
7391216 it wasnt a very good race for us today we did nothing right staying out on track while stuck behind a car that was three seconds a lap slower than us we still have a good lead in the championship but we cant afford another race like this one next week in detroit

7391220 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
7391221 was a lot faster than me and went ahead and got to my back bumper and just smoked the back bumper of my car and sent me up the racetrack
7391222 he does that and hell always come back and say hes sorry
7391223 he did it at milwaukee and hes done it a few other times its just his normal fashion
7391224 well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7391225 i think its barbecue pork i havent tried it yet but it looks great
7391226 i got a call at 10 p m last night asking me if i wanted to come here so thats the kind of stuff thats gotten me really excited about this election
7391227 i love volunteering my time for a cause i believe in but to actually be a part of it and to come to a small event like this where im going to be what 50 feet away from him its pretty amazing for me a 20 year old
7391228 i have to tell you i am starving i hear you guys have been eating for the last hour im looking for a brat or a burger or something
7391229 whats going on with peoples everyday lives the folks who are making 20 000 a year or 40 000 a year or 60 000 a year that are trying to get their kid into college or trying to pay their health care premiums at the end of every month
7391230 thats who im fighting for thats what built america that middle class this election is about you
7391231 what im really hoping for with barack is that he is going to do things differently i really do
7391232 i really think we need to almost throw out everybody and start in because there has been so much corruption
7391233 i think biden hes not such a nice guy you know obamas almost too nice a guy
7391234 both on the field of play and off this will go down as one of the greatest performances ever for a united states olympic team
7391235 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7391236 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7391237 its much more difficult for the rest of the world to compete but thats the way it should be
7391238 if recent russian actions are any indicator a technical excuse to completely block us access to the iss for geopolitical reasons would fit nicely into the kremlin toolkit
7391239 almost immediately after the czech republic signed an agreement with the us to place missile defense tracking radar in its territory oil supplies through the to the central european country were reduced to a trickle ostensibly for technical reasons
7391240 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia
7391241 degrade and burn up on rentry or with us ceding it to those who can get there
7391242 if anything at all in that five years period goes wrong with the russian soyuz then we have no system to access the space station
7391243 i walk and if i see any flags that are laying on the ground i pick them up or if there are some tilted i right them
7391244 was a slap in the face to our family members who have served in the armed forces so that we can live in this free country they shouldnt be disrespected like that
7391245 it feels great i mean its kind of a dream come true ive done two olympics and come home with two gold medals so that doesnt happen often and its really exciting
7391246 its great i dont know what else to say really its fantastic
7391247 in some ways it got more publicity because it was the big thing that was happening in hong kong the stands were packed every night and it was on the tv all the time it was exciting
7391248 we jumped at the chance we were like how many times are you going to meet an olympic gold medalist in the span of your life
7391249 i think obama and biden together can absolutely help us win colorado
7391250 the west has changed since 1992 its changed a great deal the independents in the west are really looking for leadership

7391306 really what shouldve happened based on their training is the dogs should have been able to seek the body out due to the decompositional odor said metro police sgt
7391307 in this case they were not able to do it
7391308 searching for clandestine graves is unbelievably complex said arpad vass a researcher who has spent several years analyzing the odor emitted by dead bodies
7391309 anything we can do to narrow that search area down and be more specific on where to begin the excavations we consider a success
7391310 there are missing persons over the years who disappeared as far back as the 1980s that are still missing and believed to be dead

7391319 central to our concerns is the fact that the proposal forces retail prices to be locked in for a 24 hour period he said
7391320 by banning the intra day price movements of fuel retailers motorists will ultimately pay more at the pump particularly those thousands of motorists that already shop smart and take advantage of the weekly discount cycle

7391325 this week the debate not just about luxury cars but about the other measures is a debate about their economic credibility and it looks like its one theyre the liberal party going to fail
7391326 whether its the liberal party or whether its independents in the senate or the greens the government will fight for the integrity of our budget
7391327 so were going to take them to the senate and then well see whos economically responsible and whos prepared to vote for certainty in economic policies
7391328 the liberal party is punching a huge hole in the budget surplus in the senate
7391329 we as a government are committed to taking tough decisions and tough action for the economys long term interest and also for the environments long term interest
7391330 part of that is acting responsibly on climate change and part of that in turn means acting through a pollution reduction scheme
7391331 id say to them as i say to other business that this will not come cost free because if you roll the clock ahead 10 20 years 30 years overall across australia what people are saying is this we have wasted enough time its time to act
7391332 if we fail to act the economic cost to australia will be huge

7391343 that such a large amount of fish is used for the pet food industry is real eye opener
7391344 what is also interesting is that in australia pet cats are eating an estimated 13 7 kilograms of fish a year which far exceeds the australian average human per capita fish and seafood consumption of around 11 kilograms
7391345 our pets seem to be eating better than their owners
7391346 while much of the criticism has been on the grounds that forage fish could be better used for human consumption directly particularly amongst the poorer nations of the world rather than in the production of food for farmed fish little attention has been paid to the amount of forage fish used by the pet food industry
7391347 these gourmet pet foods contain a significant amount of fish that may be suitable for direct human consumption

7391392 sometimes people look like they want to cry when they are paying for their groceries
7391393 they are searching their handbags and their pockets for every single coin i look away when this happens
7391394 my schoolwork is affected because it is too hot and too dark to study inside my home

7391397 and a bad economy generates support for the insurgency even in pakistan where people on the whole really do not want to be ruled by islamists
7391398 but the extremists are seen as the main alternative to the government so in bad times people turn to them
7391399 this has reinforced the very cynical feeling pakistanis have had for many years about the relationship with the united states theyll use you and then theyll ditch you

7391401 it keeps us current instead of waiting for the report card to come and then saying what happened
7391402 parents dont check their high school kids backpacks but they will check their e mails
7391403 it used to be that we would send home a note once your kid was in trouble
7391404 now the parents can see whether their child is getting bs or cs and see a problem before it gets too big
7391405 i believe it really keeps the parents involved in their childs education
7391406 there has to be some level of responsibility for your kids if they dont learn that they will suffer when they do go out into the world
7391407 you can be there for your child emotionally without taking the responsibility from them
7391408 i think its a really good idea because even though some kids dont like it it keeps you honest
7391409 the circumstances in the lives of these individuals that precipitate the anxiety or depression or exacerbate those conditions are as unique as there are individuals on this campus
7391410 there are different dynamics in their ability to relate to the campus and others on campus their family dynamics their academic struggles or failure or success in making connections or building a social network
7391411 college students sometimes have more choices and pressures and the feeling that they have to be perfect
7391412 they want to succeed and they want relationships to work
7391413 in addition to screening for depression and anxiety disorders when we meet with students in counseling one of the things we assess for is whether substance abuse is affecting them sometimes binge drinking or drug use contributes to academic struggles or is part of a students mood problem
7391414 some students slide into a binge drinking lifestyle they arent paying attention to how much they drink or the consequences of their drinking other students may drink in order to deal with untreated depression or anxiety including social anxiety
7391415 invading privacy is one of the most common reasons for individuals who are in a position to help for not reaching out and offering that assistance
7391416 the truth is if the individual has been giving signals that they are in trouble and in need of help they are typically appreciative of someone intervening in a way that can help them find some relief for their pain
7391417 without being too aggressive about it look for the cues and respond with a fairly benign response such as you havent been your old self or is there something you want to talk about give a stimulus like that and if the person is truly in need and trusts you they will likely disclose what is going on for them then its important for you to know whats available to help them
7391418 some parents are very tuned in to their students and have a relationship where they can talk about issues and help them get into services
7391419 in those situations the role parents play is very important its tricky because it is at a time in life when students are branching out on their own and often want to be independent balancing offering support and getting students in for needed services as well as encouraging them to take care of themselves is important
7391420 sometimes just talking to a roommate or friend in a meaningful way helps relieve things or even resolve it
7391421 there may however be some more entrenched circumstances where professional help might be in order thats the point at which an individual can be aware of the counseling center or know where to look for what help might be available
7391422 sometimes a dark themed paper is just the topic of choice as a creative effort
7391423 in certain other cases it is a more obvious statement from an individual who is troubled or potentially at risk i think if a faculty member has any doubt they can certainly bring it to the attention of me or my staff because there are some things we might be able to pick up from the background and information that would suggest the student is at risk we can consult with a faculty member about determining the nature of the risk and how to address that with the individual
7391424 behaviors involving substance abuse and eating disorders are serving a coping function
7391425 there is something the student is getting from the behavior and that makes it harder for them to want to give it up on the one hand they know its not good to be binge drinking or binging and purging but on the other they think it helps with the anxiety they are feeling when we see students about other issues we try to connect the condition and behaviors with their consequences to try to increase motivation to work on their problems
7391426 we review treatment choices and decide with the student what is the best plan
7391427 i dont know what will be the team against rangers
7391428 the only thing i can say is that everybody at this club will be ready and fit mentally and physically for this game this is the best game in scotland we must be ready for the challenge
7391429 i think the number one thing that strikes is frustration anxiety knots in your stomach all the things that go along with the injury to the players that do not allow your team to function as it is presented on paper
7391430 those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are
7391431 when youre young the best thing you can have under your belt is games
7391432 its a little discouraging but the players have shown a lot of fortitude were writing it off as bad luck and moving forward
7391433 the anxiety is starting to set in and they want to kick somebody else if you will instead of kicking each other
7391434 we cannot apologize enough for losing the precious kannon statue and the hall
7391435 wed like to rebuild the hall as soon as possible so that people can visit without anxiety
7391436 i have probably a good 11 new kids and im still getting calls about the swim team we have a lot more lap swimmers and a lot more people coming to open swim getting their kids in the water weve had a definite increase
7391437 generally the olympics create a lot of excitement in swimming and we get a lot of kids who are interested in swimming give us a call and want to try out its usually two to three times as many swimmers interested in starting than in a typical year
7391438 swimming is under the radar until the olympics come around which is unfortunate for swimming because its a great sport its nice for the kids to get exposed to that every four years it would be nice if it was that way every year
7391439 our learn to row class that doesnt even start until sept 9 its already full ive never seen a class fill this fast
7391440 even the kids who have been doing gymnastics want to come more than once a week now
7391441 swimming is a great aerobic activity its great for overall health
7391442 swimming works all the muscles of the body your arms your legs your core muscles are a big factor
7391443 aerobically it does great things for your heart and your lungs
7391444 and it teaches one of our big things it teaches life skills it teaches you to be dedicated to something it teaches you to work hard it teaches you to manage time it teaches you that hard work is rewarded by improvement and getting better it teaches goal setting
7391445 thats one of the huge benefits its teaching them time management they dont have time to sit around and do nothing
7391446 its taught them confidence its taught them to try new things its taught them to push through their fear seeing the benefits of the success of trying new things and overcoming their fear and anxiety
7391447 it just really reminds me to work hard and remind myself im so lucky to be in this sport
7391448 it excited me to strive someday i want to be there like that
7391449 its teaching them life lessons i never thought it would not only that its teaching them a healthy way of life

7391459 the reality is there probably wont be any more data breach activity than normal were just going to hear and talk about every one now which is a healthy thing because it provides transparency and establishes security performance as a market differentiator but it will be painful for a few years
7391460 while notification is an important mitigation strategy it will not always be the appropriate response to a breach providing notification about low risk breaches can cause undue anxiety and de sensitise individuals to notice
7391461 once an agency and organisation has discovered or suspects that a personal information security breach has occurred they should take immediate common sense steps to limit the breach
7391462 notification can be an important mitigation strategy that has the potential to benefit both the agency or organisation and the individuals affected by a personal information security breach the challenge is to determine when notification is appropriate while notification is an important mitigation strategy it will not always be the appropriate response to a breach providing notification about low risk breaches can cause undue anxiety and de sensitise individuals to notice each incident needs to be considered on a case by case basis to determine whether breach notification is required

7391581 the unveiling was a celebration for her and a chance for us to say our last goodbye
7391582 since her death we have been bringing up our three grandkids we got custody after she died
7391583 the kids have not heard or seen their mother for a year at the unveiling was the first time they had seen her
7391584 we are not angry there is no point whatever attitude we have wont bring our baby back
7391585 we are relaxing now that our darlings headstone is up all we do now is focus on our babies that are here
7391586 the increased use of pre court summary justice is one of the most important elements in the governments strategy for modernising the criminal justice system the implementation of the strategy has received virtually no research inspectoral or parliamentary scrutiny
7391587 the trend towards pre court summary justice should more incisively be scrutinised to ensure that justice is being meted out fairly and effectively we cannot be wholly confident that this is so
7391588 labours ad hoc and distorted approach has created the worst of both worlds not only are serious offenders escaping real justice due to the reliance on spot fines but as this report shows many people who should be dealt with informally are being criminalised
7391589 the best way to avoid a criminal record is not to break the law the law abiding majority want to see crimes dealt with effectively and fixed penalty notices and cautions are part of this process
7391590 i am committed to ensuring we have an injury compensation system suitable for the challenges of modern day policing which recognises the demanding and sometimes dangerous roles that police officers carry out
7391591 i hope the changes will provide peace of mind and assurances to police officers and their families while ensuring the system is as effective as possible administered consistently and targets help where it is needed most
7391592 youre kidding right its a sleeve of a sweater isnt it
7391593 this is the first time we feel like were a member of the world

7391595 just lie down or lean against something and close your eyes
7391596 the fundamental macroeconomic problem in the american economy is that for years
7391597 despite intense efforts theres really been little progress made over the last few decades in terms of outcome
7391598 even with the best treatment we have which is a combination of surgery radiotherapy and chemotherapy the median survival is only 15 months
7391599 the problem is its in your head and its not like you can chop it off thats what makes it so hard to deal with you cant get away from it
7391600 its at that point we will come in and try something unique
7391601 on its own in its current form its not the big breakthrough were looking for
7391602 and we know what chemotherapy does to people what we dont know is what might happen if we combine the two treatments
7391603 because this hasnt been done before we dont actually know whether this can be done we dont know if its a feasible treatment for the patients
7391604 its fair to say that there is a lot more to understand about how these vaccinations work im confident that we can get them to be a lot more efficacious in the future based on the basic research were doing in the lab
7391605 to have a glimmer of hope would be fantastic for people because you need that

7391627 un tema ampliamente tratado en la conferencia de sida 2008 es el hecho que varios pa ses niegan la entrada o el permiso de estad a a personas vih positivas debido a su condici n de vih seg n la publicaci n entry denied entrada denegada de unaids en asociaci n con otras organizaciones y distribuida en la conferencia al menos 67 pa ses est n en la lista de los que niegan la entrada a las personas que viven con vih sida
7391628 durante una sesi n sobre restricciones de viaje para personas que viven con vih los participantes despreciaron el hecho que a pesar que no hay evidencia que las restricciones de viaje tengan un impacto positivo en la salud p blica 67 pa ses siguen teniendo restricciones en vigor
7391629 prohibici n para la gente con enfermedades mentales o infecciones transmitidas sexualmente eso es muy divertido si el gobierno chino cree que puede controlar cada aspecto de las olimpiadas est n tristemente equivocados seg n estad sticas del 2007 publicadas por la organizaci n mundial de salud el ndice de vih sida en china es del 2 9 de la poblaci n la prohibici n parece no estar funcionando
7391630 muchos expertos en sida y activistas de derechos encuentran que la nueva legislaci n es un motivo para celebrar anteriormente las restricciones de viaje pod an causar m s problemas de los que imped a con lo que se originaba que la gente con vih mintiera acerca de su condici n era discriminatorio y tambi n podr a llevar a muchos de los infectados a mentir
7391631 ahora depende del secretario de salud cambiar las regulaciones para que reflejen la nueva legislaci n el vih debe ser retirado de la lista de enfermedades que implican inadmisibilidad en estados unidos pero la congresista barbara lee tiene confianza en que esto ocurrir pronto

7391662 i know him very well and i know he has been on the front lines of the fight for social and economic justice his entire time in public service
7391663 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7391664 i was sent to denver to vote for clinton i would be letting my voters down if i voted for anyone else
7391665 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7391666 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7391667 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7391668 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7391669 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7391670 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7391671 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7391672 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out
7391673 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7391674 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7391675 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7391676 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7391677 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression

7391684 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7391685 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7391686 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7391687 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7391688 that very week i had been toying with the idea of blogging going so far as to have set up an as yet unpublished first post
7391689 blogs and wikis are now becoming mainstream communication tools but who in the department of the navy is actually using them
7391690 were incredibly fortunate to have pete geren secretary of the u s army and general george casey chief of staff of the u s army join us via phone for the bloggers roundtable panel
7391691 i value the diary tremendously but im scared stiff its going to get lost
7391692 the army does not routinely monitor blogs regarding postings of specific personnel or groups of personnel it is not standard practice for the military to target or single out individual military blogs unless a particular blog has been brought to the attention of the chain of command or other dod department of defense officials for gross opsec operational security violations
7391693 the success of that is what will be the turning point for the soldiers to come home the faster we reconstruct the faster the soldiers can come back

7391712 this was an event specifically for the south asian community and after all the pre publicity we gave them we were forced to rewrite someones elses story do they think we are not important enough in the scheme of things were they just there to collect money
7391713 our policy with fundraisers is we have one pool reporter from a mainstream i mean local newspaper and one reporter who travels with barack at those events
7391714 i am sure he must have had an indian guy tutor him on what to say
7391715 i dont know why they did that im sure they would have liked the publicity
7391716 it was a private fundraiser and press are not allowed at such events

7391720 ladies and gentleman the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing
7391721 first national poll conducted after barack obama publicly named joe biden as his running mate
7391722 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7391723 emphasis added throughout photo courtesy getty images in a new cnn opinion research corp poll released sunday night 47 percent of those questioned are backing obama the presumptive democratic presidential nominees with an equal amount supporting his republican opponent mccain obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7391724 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7391725 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7391726 would you give up your other victories to have gotten one democratic president elected

7391760 yeah big shot go ahead and ask him see what he says
7391761 okay what kind of bedtime story do you guys want to hear tonight
7391762 a reuben story are you sure they are always so boring and predictable
7391763 no theyre not i love them reuben stories are the best because he is a real dog that can do real cool things
7391764 nooooo not that one it takes too long and the ending is all wrong he gets away with the crime again
7391765 alright already if you want to hear that tired old boring no good low down dirty dealing scum sucking low rent rag of a story for the ten millionth time ill tell it but i wont like it and nothing you say can make me like it
7391766 let us begin one fine sunny day reuben the wonder dog woke from his slumber at 333 main street stroudsburg pennsylvania 18360 to a smell that was very familiar this was going to be a glorious day this was the day that halloween begins not the actual holiday mind you but the beginning of the holiday the day that the stores put out all the supplies costumes and candy buckets face paint pirate hooks and pumpkin carving kits mountains of treats and flashlights in the form of jack o lanterns and the one thing that rueben the wonder dog loved above all other things
7391767 you are correct a smell like that on a day like that day called for extra caution and so reuben decided to walk along the creek so he could travel unnoticed by the stroudsburg police quickly he covered the distance to the shopping center coming out between the kmart and the weiss grocery store the smell was strongest from kmart and reuben continued undaunted till he arrived at the front door
7391768 im glad you asked reuben carefully observed that people walk right up to the door and it opens when they get close and so he heads for the door himself
7391769 when he gets there nothing happens and he bumps his very long nose into the glass door he steps back sits down like a regular dog to fool everyone into thinking he is average and waiting for a human and watches carefully as people come and go through the door he begins to jump up and down on his hind legs trying to imitate the people and guess what happens
7391770 you are correct the door opens and he goes right inside like he was a person or something
7391771 once inside the first place he sees is the jewelry department but he does not stay long because
7391772 because there are no or ange marsh mallow cir cus pea nuts
7391773 you are correct the second place he comes to is the childrens department but he doesnt stay long because
7391774 because there are no or ange marsh mallow cir cus pea nuts
7391775 you are correct he works his way through ladies shoes mens wear infants hardware automotive outdoor lawn and garden and toys but he doesnt stay long because
7391776 because there are no or ange marsh mallow cir cus pea nuts
7391777 was so good that he totally skipped breakfast and now he was very hungry
7391778 a man with a broom kept trying to shoo reuben away from the shelf and push him towards the door but reuben would have no part of that
7391779 and shook the bag so hard that the bag burst and all the
7391780 wild dog in the candy aisle wild dog in the candy aisle
7391781 well i was scared that i would get in trouble and i needed the oil filter so danny and i went to the automotive section and found the right one
7391782 the dog is going wild in the candy aisle and is eating all the
7391783 you are correct after i got my change danny and i walked over to the candy aisle to see if it really was him and of course it was by now his whole face was dripping with marshmallow and there were some whole peanuts hanging from the fur along his muzzle he looked like a civil war general with big bushy chops and little eyes i walked back to the man with the broom and asked him if i could help get the dog out of the store
7391784 he said that it was too dangerous and that the police would be there soon
7391785 to use as bait i began to wave the bag in reubens face and he began to snap at it each time i would pull it away and he would miss with every wave snap and miss i took a step forward and reuben took a step back until he bumped into danny startled he shot forward just enough for me to grab his collar and scoop him up in my arms danny ran ahead to get the car started and pulled up to the door i walked calmly down the aisle and towards the door with people clapping and cheering the man with the broom looked like he just won the lottery i jumped in the back of the car and made reuben sit on the floor we pulled out of the parking lot just as the police were turning in my heart was beating so fast i thought it would jump right out of my chest when we got back to the house reuben jumped out of the car and guess what he had in his mouth
7391786 the bag of or ange marsh mallow cir cus pea nuts
7391787 you are correct okay lights out now more crime stories time for sleep

7391789 appear to be starting from the axiom that smart algorithms software designs which cost a lot of work to develop by smart people are by definition intellectual property and that patents on them therefore by definition are valid im incorrect however because intellectual property only pops into existence when the law defines that a particular immaterial creation can be associated with certain exclusion rights the default situation is that creations of the mind are free for use by everyone and therefore patents are the exception to the rule default situation there is no good reason to deviate from this default situation because a plenty of innovation also happens without giving companies people access to broad 17 year exclusion rights b given the complexity of software a single patent no matter how smart you thought you were thinking it up virtually always affects an immense number of independently developed programs during the course of its lifetime c network effects the more people use a particular product technology file format the more valuable it becomes for developers and consumers so erecting artificial barriers is counterproductive for both
7391790 there is in fact not a single protection instrument which offers an as broad combination of coverage in terms of both the covered object patent claims are fairly broad as the people to whom it applies everyone even those who independently came up with the same thing as a patent
7391791 society is not required to hand out software patents i e extremely heavy handed exclusion rights to stimulate innovation in the software field

7391890 the project dragged on for four to five months to a point where microsoft matched the price by offering windows xp for us20 a copy and throwing in office for us30 but we still came out cheaper microsoft was also providing free training to high school teachers
7391891 because we saved so much we gave the government 3000 additional units so now another 300 schools have linux networks
7391892 people in the government now understand linux can do so much for so little outlay
7391893 in a brand new computer 50 percent goes to the operating system and office suite so how many people can afford that

7391895 the ideals which have lighted my way and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully have been kindness beauty and truth
7391896 said you had to break iraq up into three different countries
7391897 m aintain a unified iraq by decentralizing it and giving kurds shiites and sunnis breathing room in their own regions
7391898 said you had to break iraq up into three different countries
7391899 m aintain a unified iraq by decentralizing it and giving kurds shiites and sunnis breathing room in their own regions
7391900 t he central government would be responsible for common interests like border security and the distribution of oil revenues
7391901 is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs while leaving the central government in charge of common interests
7391902 we are not trying to impose our plan if the iraqis dont want it they wont and shouldnt take it
7391903 the united states should actively support a political settlement among iraqs major factions based upon the provisions of the constitution of iraq that create a federal system of government and allow for the creation of federal regions
7391904 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7391905 the policeman who is involved in general operations duty had gone to the state police headquarters to undergo the test the officer in charge for the test then detected there was some drug in his urine
7391906 this budget will help the rural folks and take care of poor families apart from encouraging private sector driven businesses
7391907 the knowledge that you gain is something that people cannot take from you and it is not only what you learn in your course but also in the workplace and from your interaction with society
7391908 you have to start from the very basic take things one step at a time and increase your knowledge experience and if necessary your skills
7391909 malaysia needs more innovators and entrepreneurs as catalysts of change in our new economy think of how you can create wealth for yourself and the nation create job opportunities for others and contribute richly towards society
7391910 these projects aimed at improving the socio economic status and standard of living of the hardcore poor in rural areas have been successful in sabah and pahang similar projects will be carried out in other states
7391911 we are however reacting to racial connotations which we shouldnt
7391912 for the students who were verbally abused telling them the reason the teacher acted that way towards them was because they are indians will leave a negative impression
7391913 they will grow up thinking this way and the racial issue will be carried on into the future
7391914 children and adolescents are going through many developmental changes in their lives as such there can be behavioural issues
7391915 if stressful situations with youngsters occur a teacher should be able to address them with a clear mind
7391916 in government hospitals doctors work long hours and they often lack sleep
7391917 this is why it is important for government servants to attend retreats and training sessions every now and then to revive themselves so they are psychologically healthier and do not do something they may regret when they get angry
7391918 getting angry is human nature a persons level of patience and tolerance is eroding given the rat race climate now
7391919 people are just working too hard and its getting to them
7391920 walk away from trouble go find a big heap of newspapers and tear it all up i advise a lot of my patients to do this
7391921 and when you come back to the person who was annoying you you will be calmer and able to discuss matters
7391922 these actions could hurt you so the soft pile of newspapers is the best option
7391923 this teacher obviously felt she had some power to do this
7391924 in this teachers case instead of just being slapped on the wrist with a transfer she should be investigated and evaluated
7391925 but here there is no disciplinary action because although she is transferred she still gets her salary her bonuses and so on
7391926 and she could go on to do the same thing at the next school
7391927 i believe the motive is revenge and because the victims banishment order was lifted a month ago
7391928 we are still looking at his past criminal records and trying to determine who was out to seek revenge against him
7391929 the businessman lodged a police report and we arrested the suspect in petaling jaya to facilitate investigations
7391930 police managed to recover part of the ransom in several locations in the klang valley
7391931 they are dangerous and extremely ruthless we believe they are responsible for many kidnappings over the past five years
7391932 we met at niyor estate in kluang and he said his name was andil anak eneind
7391933 as my name is andy i said why not take a photograph with me and we did i sent the photograph home and later put it on a website www fight4thepjm org for veterans who had served in malaya
7391934 a welsh guy by the name of stuart goring who was studying the iban trackers said he met someone called andil who told him that he had worked with scottish soldiers

7391971 i just didnt have it i couldnt throw the ball where i wanted to throw it i just didnt make pitches thats all there is to it
7391972 i face them again in five days and hopefully ill be able to make the adjustment and go out there and have a better game plan against them
7391973 everybody should enjoy their job the crowd loves it they look for me to see me coming out i just go out and give them a show
7391974 he is great for our sport he can help to build up our sport
7391975 he was fantastic we are very privileged to have this
7391976 ive been tested so many times in the competition ive lost count
7391977 we know were good we know were clean we work hard and any time you want to test us its okay
7391978 we still want to go out there and win every game theres no one here who doesnt care if we win or lose
7391979 i would love to get that record im not going to lie to you
7391980 its not all about me its about the ballclub and winning ballgames
7391981 winning two out of four its not a bad series
7391982 the three run homer couldnt have come at a better time
7391983 it was a well played game we got down battled back and we had a big inning thanks to bengie
7391984 it doesnt matter if i win six games or 20 games or whatever
7391985 if were having success as a team thats the biggest thing its just having wins it doesnt matter who gets them or how you get them it just depends on if we do get them and we just need to keep on doing that
7391986 we have no doubt the refereeing and judging is clean honest and transparent but we need higher standards
7391987 its true that we havent won a gold medal but im not aware of any problems with the team and im sure that in future competitions well be able to win many gold medals
7391988 well go there to wrap up qualification to the group stage aware that well have to put in the same determination we put in during the first leg in
7391989 well be faced with opposition who dearly want to put on a good show in front of their fans
7391990 hes had so many things like this happen to him i believe this might be his fourth acl maybe in his career hes had a lot of tough breaks injury wise he was on a one year contract so this was very tough for him
7391991 besides javon and ronald none of those guys have really played before
7391992 all of these wins at this time of the year seem to really get magnified so hopefully that can kind of spur us on
7391993 i wish i would have had about 15 more minutes to sit out there with my team instead of come out here as quickly as i did
7391994 fortunately hes got good enough stuff to not let them score any runs which is pretty amazing because it seemed like there was people on base all over the place
7391995 if we won the game it would mean a lot more
7391996 but right now were in a pennant race and were going to need more than just a hundred rbis im going to need to keep driving in runs and helping us win ballgames
7391997 i come prepared everyday thats all i have in mind
7391998 i dont prepare myself to be a backup either i wake up at the same time and i eat at the same time as well i prepare for the game the same way

7392003 i messed up so its best for the team and im here for them
7392004 this is an opportunity for me to prove myself and showcase my skills and showcase my leadership so thats how im looking at it
7392005 robert marve will be the starter we will not have a controversy if a guy like jacory can go in and have a tremendous game robert marve still will be the starter we have to build depth at that position

7392007 the small eclipse of american influence that the obama presidency in the same way as clinton before him may result in what would also be an unexpected opportunity for europe finally it may assume its responsibilities as an adult i dont think obama will bring a renaissance to america on every front but i am certain he will provoke europe to come together and drive a rapprochement with russia

7392048 the system we are developing will work to do the opposite expand time our goal is to take the golden hour and make it four times longer
7392049 there is very little time to resuscitate people but what if we had another hour or even 20 minutes more people might make it

7392051 i have extremely high hopes for vitalmedix there isnt a treatment for accident victims today that is effective
7392052 one of the great stories in the military right now is that wounds that did kill so many people in vietnam arent killing them in iraq and afghanistan
7392053 are terrible things but these guys are surviving a lot more than they would have in the 1960s and 70s because they have better body armor but the bad news is yeah they are surviving for a while but they are bleeding out by the time they get back into the combat support hospital
7392054 so that oxygen supply meets demand even in the face of severe blood loss
7392055 cells cant live without oxygen thats what we were always taught
7392056 thats not exactly true they can live without oxygen they cant live without fuel cells have to continuously produce energy otherwise they die
7392057 we dont know yet but you have to remember that these people who are receiving this drug are essentially going to die unless something just short of a miracle happens we are working with people that are in such bad condition in the first place that i feel optimistic that we will do some good
7392058 we have much yet to learn about trauma and how the human body responds to it
7392059 we do know that providing critical care to an acutely injured person at a motor vehicle or some other accident scene often at night and in poor weather conditions is a very challenging undertaking
7392060 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7392061 if we find a deposit of perchlorate one can speculate that water had melted at some point and had collected it into an accumulation
7392062 we also heated the sample differently the oxygen bearing compound presumably perchlorate might have been there but we might have destroyed it when we were looking for organic compounds
7392063 were not going to be looking for the organic compounds were going to use the same heating plan that we did on the first sample
7392064 in addition to looking for oxygen were going to look for chlorine

7392070 our whole genome analysis supports placing the placozoans after the sponge lineage branched from other animals
7392071 trichoplax has had just as much time to evolve as humans but because of its morphological simplicity it is tempting to think of it as a surrogate for an early animal
7392072 the latest and most complex analysis again suggests that placozoans populated the oceans long before sponges evolved
7392073 the outcome of the trichoplax adhaerens genome sequencing is so exciting that we are now culturing another 13 placozoan species in order to identify the most basal placozoan lineage and genome
7392074 trichoplax is an ancient lineage a good representation of the ancestral genome that is shedding light of the kinds of genes the structures of genes and even how these genes were arranged on the genome in the common ancestor 600 million years ago
7392075 it has retained a lot of primitive features relative to other living animals
7392076 it lacks a nervous system but it still is able to respond to environmental stimuli
7392077 it has genes such as ion channels and receptors that we associate with neuronal functions but no neurons have ever been reported
7392078 some of our new placozoan species show frequent sexual reproduction while others never show any signs of sex
7392079 the genome data allow us to search for the genes responsible for sex and life cycle complexity

7392098 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
7392099 the same information is gathered about foreign travelers but it is held for 75 years
7392100 highlight both the truth and the reasons behind the lies about belarus
7392101 support the progressive policies undertaken by the government of belarus since 1994
7392102 lukashenko is actually carrying out the peoples popular will and not pursuing purely personal goals nor does he have any sponsors interests to look after
7392103 as such belarus has a particularly strong social policy in fact its economy is termed as being socially orientated this means that the belarusian system allows the economy to work for the people instead of the other way around
7392104 destatisation and privatisation of state property in the republic of belarus
7392105 it doesnt matter who runs this country they are all the same they are members of the political elite and they do not represent the working class it will just be a change of face but pakistan wont see any benefits it is the poorer people of society who have to deal with inflation
7392106 the political sniping between the ppp and pml n has heightened jitters among american officials that no one is actually in charge as the taliban insurgency gains steam
7392107 d oubts are growing among american officials over the level of cooperation they can expect from the new army chief ashfaq parvez kayani a former head of intelligence who took over the post from mr musharraf last november
7392108 the coalition has pledged to abolish that provision the 17th amendment
7392109 but if mr zardari manages to keep that power the united states could be back to its one stop shopping window though with a different character behind the counter
7392110 if the bush administration invests some serious diplomatic energy on courting him even half of the effort it has spent over the past year on trying to save musharraf from humiliation it can build a working relationship with nawaz
7392111 i am proud to be associated with you i think you did better than anyone could have because of your standing your reputation and your integrity
7392112 i want to see the president of the united states succeed in iraq his success is americas success and his failure is americas failure
7392113 this disconnect i believe is fueling cynicism that is undermining the single most important weapon we need to give our troops to be able to do their job and that is the unyielding support of the american people that support is waning

7392116 biden has carved out a niche as the democratic presidential candidate most willing to publicly rebuke antiwar sentiment
7392117 that there is any possibility in the lifetime of anyone here of having the iraqis get together have a unity government in baghdad that pulls the country together that will not happen it will not happen in the lifetime of anyone here
7392118 acceptable perhaps even satisfying conclusion to the great veep search
7392119 when biden went after john mccain with a vigor and yes a venom that has been missing from obamas stump speaking it was a tonic for the troops who have been waiting for a campaign that is more prepared to throw punches than take them
7392120 which will not be limited to poland russia and america
7392121 every effort is justified to ensure that a policy of confrontation does not replace that of cooperation to which we owe 18 years of stability
7392122 we call upon all sides to immediately terminate the intolerable violence
7392123 agree a ceasefire and seek a peaceful solution the forcible conquest of south ossetia by georgia is just as unacceptable as the invasion of russian troops on the side of separatists in south ossetia
7392124 do you believe that the american military advisors stationed in tbilisi encouraged georgia to launch its attack
7392125 i wouldnt go that far but everyone knows that these us military advisors in georgia exist a deployment that ive never considered particularly intelligent and it would have been strange if these experts had not had any information either they were extremely unprofessional or they were truly fooled which is hard to imagine

7392129 dangerous times particularly for europe which finds itself once again in the geopolitical centre of a dispute which is being fueled by others for them it may be tolerable they are far away embedded in their own hemispheres europe lies between them is a neighbour to both needs both politically economically and not just because of its almost complete dependence on energy imports from all parts of the world therefore europe must de escalate must restore links where they have been broken the calming down of the amis the russians ones own hotheads lies in my opinion in the interest of the europeans

7392131 we know the fungus has been out in the wild now for at least 20 years but we still dont really understand why in such a short space of time there was such a heavy decline in numbers
7392132 every time we answer a question we get 10 more questions we need people and funding to answer these questions
7392133 we found that in queensland as the fungus swept through frog populations the mortality could be very high with some species disappearing completely
7392134 other species were severely knocked about by the disease but eventually bounced back despite the fungus still being evident in the population
7392135 we want to reinstate the integrity of the queensland parliament if you cant trust yourself to tell the truth then you shouldnt be in parliament
7392136 the labor party couldnt trust itself to tell the truth so what it did was to do away with the law that made it a criminal sanction not to tell the truth
7392137 weve had a law in queensland which i think always put us above and beyond all of the other jurisdictions right across australia
7392138 i mean if you are giving evidence to a parliamentary committee then you should be giving proper evidence
7392139 the average person out there is up on a perjury charge if they give false evidence to a court
7392140 why should it be any different if a member of parliament gives false evidence to the highest court in the land which is the parliament
7392141 the fear was that we were going to be ambushed afterwards
7392142 the concern is about the other guys because they are messed up worse than us
7392143 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7392144 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet
7392145 this is just a transitory period of subdued growth and we will get through the other side and the growth will resume to more normal levels

7392175 that led me to publish pgp electronically for free that year shortly before the measure was defeated after vigorous protest by civil libertarians and industry groups
7392176 joe biden made his second attempt to introduce such legislation
7392177 justice should go ahead now to seek a legislative fix to the digital telephony problem and all parties should prepare to follow through on the encryption problem in about a year success with digital telephony will lock in one major objective we will have a beachhead we can exploit for the encryption fix and the encryption access options can be developed more thoroughly in the meantime

7392180 the fbi could get a wiretap to investigate the mafia but they could not get one to investigate terrorists to put it bluntly that was crazy whats good for the mob should be good for terrorists
7392181 the justice department had the ability to use wiretaps including roving taps in criminal investigations of terrorism just as in other criminal investigations long before the patriot act
7392182 presidents illegal wiretapping program that allows intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on the conversations of americans without a judges approval or congressional authorization or oversight
7392183 i think most americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind of bone chilling information is making its way over the internet

7392201 first the slovak orchestra is much better than the beijing orchestra which suffers from shrill upper string sound
7392202 more to the point the beijing orchestra is using breiners ideas so blatantly that it would be accused of plagiarism if its arrangers submitted their orchestration as original work in any respectable conservatory it isnt just the rockets red glare breiners basic conception of the whole piece has been copied
7392203 we have not heard of naxos rights international breiners publisher which has apparently attempted to discuss the issue with the committee
7392204 all the anthems and songs used at the beijing games were orchestrated by chinese musicians

7392276 our livestock and equestrian numbers are looking fantastic probably record numbers in two or three different sections

7392286 in the explosion the tank was completely destroyed and four occupation terrorists were killed
7392287 this is an invention by mr harper to try to trigger an election before he loses the byelections
7392288 a few days ago he just called a fourth byelection in don valley west its taxpayers money
7392289 this is full improvisation and it shows panic from the prime minister
7392290 canadians will certainly give a lot of interest to their own federal politics
7392291 this game refutes those who say that good football does not exist in italy there were four goals and if teams play like us and roma anything is possible

7392295 hoks challenge is to balance the design to realise both security and accessibility this is being achieved with considerable thought being given to the environment
7392296 is often informed by making intelligent decisions about perceived constraints
7392297 but by the grace of god i am what i am
7392298 actually were in the closed beta already so the game is already out and you cant delay a game thats already been released and already been played by people
7392299 this game needs a patch so miraculous it would make moses parting the red sea
7392300 who controls the past controls the future who controls the present controls the past
7392301 no man shall ever behold the glory of christ by sight in heaven who does not in some measure behold it by faith in this world
7392302 you didnt hear any one of them get in this debate at all until they announced for president

7392306 he was a one way starter for us last year but well use him at halfback as well this season
7392307 because the arab government wanted us to be more arabic

7392313 team president peter wilt actually lives like four blocks away from me ive stayed away because i dont want it to be weird
7392314 i really like it there but well see what happens
7392315 i havent really thought about it in the last couple of weeks but obviously los angeles
7392316 its a great time for this to happen because there isnt a lot going on with the national team next year so its a great time to try to transition to that
7392317 itll be less time with the national team but its a great environment with your club training every day with your club a lot more games in its opportunity for pia to see more players so i think its going to help the national team in the end
7392318 for me i need to read the game often practice just doesnt do justice you can be the best shot stopper you can be so good at making saves but if you cant make those decisions in the games youre not going to be a great goalkeeper
7392319 it was attempting to take off from the lake when it lost air speed and entered a wooded area west of the lake
7392320 a shareholder approached me and he told me i dont care about your cause all i care about is the money in my pocket
7392321 and an ideological war it is our country and we will defend it
7392322 the world is losing the war i think at the moment they the taleban definitely have the upper hand
7392323 the issue which is not just a bad case scenario as far as pakistan is concerned or as afghanistan is concerned but it is going to be spreading further the whole world is going to be affected by it
7392324 the smoke was everywhere mixed with blood and pieces of flesh

7392327 i live in the shaab neighborhood and i move freely even if it is 9 p m which i couldnt do for a long time
7392328 im afraid while im standing here because the explosions may happen at any time but seeing the thousands of fans is really joyful
7392329 the tone mr khamenei used to support mr ahmadinejad suggests that his intention was more than defending him against the attacks
7392330 it appears that mr ahmadinejad and mr khamenei share the same views over major policies and ideological values such as resisting the west and the nuclear policy
7392331 some bullying and demanding countries wanted to impose their will on our country
7392332 but our people and the president and his ministers stood up to such demands
7392333 we cant be satisfied with the way the country is being run
7392334 a country with abundant resources should not have gas cuts in winter and power cuts in summer or have people spending hours in line waiting at gas stations
7392335 every time we got something to dry land the river would rise and things would start to float away again people who have lived here for 30 40 years said theyve never seen it like that
7392336 fay has caused millions of dollars of damage and our fellow floridians need help
7392337 the greatest stimulus comes from new money what economists call a helicopter drop

7392346 but i dont hold it against him at all a small life can be great thats his decsision and i respect it i wish him well in his small life
7392347 i would suspect that there are a lot more young people than old people registering

7392356 if you know beverly byron youre going to do what she says shes been extremely helpful in this campaign and thats one of the other reasons were going to win this election
7392357 i scrimped on my fuel right from the start and it paid off today
7392358 what a shame that it wasnt good enough to win today timo and i were the fastest in the lmp2 class over the whole weekend
7392359 my start was very good and i was able to increase my lead during my stint
7392360 i would have loved to climb the podium again but at least we still have a ten point advantage in the championship we will attack again next weekend in detroit and hopefully increase that gap even further
7392361 im thrilled to climb the podium again this result shows just how well our team works
7392362 once again my team put an ultra fast car on the track for us today our success today is largely thanks to our mechanics
7392363 we are still analysing why the fuel strategy of our 7 rs spyder didnt work we will be checking this thoroughly except for this error the porsche teams performed excellently today the pit stops were extremely fast and the drivers did a great job
7392364 it was a fantastic race with a difficult strategic decision in the final phase all the more beautiful it is that we have now clinched a double victory in the american le mans series for the third time in succession proving vorsprung durch technik and this being achieved against very strong competition congratulations to the whole team also on prematurely clinching the manufacturers championships
7392365 that was a real challenge for me when i had to overtake almost all prototypes again at the end of the race it worked out well our car was not in a perfect shape after our little mishap in the pits and i really had to fight our engineer told me on the radio that i had to push like hell i did and fortunately it worked out
7392366 ive not seen such a great race for quite a while it was really exciting it was nail biting because we were not sure if we could bring the victory home there were two different strategies for our two cars its great that this gave us a 1 2 victory it was really close in the end for emanuele pirro who opted for the save fuel method we went flat out but had to pit under green i dedicate this victory to our boys who worked a lot this week and put a great car on the wheels for us
7392367 it was a difficult race because we gambled a little bit with the fuel from one side it was good because we really used the last drop of diesel that was in our tank this allowed us to finish second on the very last lap on the other side we lost the chance to fight for the victory as soon we had to back off and save fuel this was a little bit frustrating but it is a great result for audi and we enjoy it
7392368 i really learned to save fuel during the stint i was two steps of power down but this was not enough and i had to roll the car into the corners despite that my lap times were good enough to keep the lmp 2 cars behind im not happy about the race result because we had a fast car but we gambled and didnt make it im happy on how we managed the situation and im happy about the way i drove i literally ran out of fuel at start and finish it was good to finish second in these conditions
7392369 it was definitely a team effort after rebuilding one car on friday all the way into the night because of a damaged monocoque the team performed extremely well and our four drivers were great the complete team did a great job im very pleased

7392373 peaceful protest against scientology disrupted by rioting in denver today
7392374 those people are free to seek compensation for that you do understand that dont you
7392375 were no one were just protesting that church there its a dangerous organisation
7392376 didnt care about them he wanted to know about you where do you come from who are you are you a student
7392377 whatever happened to that girl the justice system would account for
7392378 in the end its the knowledge this man discovered that helps these people in their lives
7392379 much of it was plagiarised and above the lowest levels unworkable
7392380 those people are free to seek compensation for that you do understand that dont you
7392381 when i took office in 2005 our rates were among the high est in the country
7392382 with the amount weve reduced rates in the past year about 30 percent we can call workers comp reform a success
7392383 it will make businesses like contractors who have to compete with out of state businesses be competi tive
7392384 not made sufficient efforts to determine the potential cost savings to carriers of all of the provisions of senate bill 1
7392385 if youre a violent offender rot in hell i really feel strongly about that but if you have a disease we will help you
7392386 if i had a magic wand to wave at our education system i would wave it to increase the level of participation of parents
7392387 a moratorium on charter schools is moving in the wrong direction
7392388 we should reward teachers who take on additional challenges and we should reward teachers who have results
7392389 the eleven and a half cut that im announcing is a direct result of that legislation
7392390 the rate freeze in 2006 and the 17 1 2 to 22 percent cut in 2007 were the result of that effort from my office this 30 percent cut has been a real partnership between the legislature and the insurance commissioners office and the private sector
7392391 the court record is replete with evidence that scientology is nothing in reality but a vast enterprise to extract the maximum amount of money from its adepts by pseudo scientific theories and to exercise a kind of blackmail against persons who do not wish to continue with their sect the organization clearly is schizophrenic and paranoid and this bizarre combination seems to be a reflection of its founder l ron hubbard
7392392 and this is where lil dave sat down to take care of his bowel thetans and found himself surrounded by fire ants
7392393 youre one major faggot if you think syb is a scilon

7392395 were happy wed rather see it be more like 50 percent or 60 percent but we think were heading down the right path
7392396 workers comp has probably been the no 1 expense for contractors for a while
7392397 its good to have the curve go in the other direction a little bit
7392398 were not aware of any doctors who were treating compensation cases who have stopped as a result of this fee schedule
7392399 over a thousand doctors applied to be certified which tells us they want to be in the system
7392400 a lot of companies that relocate here look at workers comp rates as an indicator of the economic climate

7392409 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7392410 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7392411 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7392412 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7392413 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7392414 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7392415 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7392416 a development path that leads to a grown woman who deep down still sees herself as all sugar and spice
7392417 the film is structured around a tale about a rebbe who is on his way somewhere and is taken in by some strangers who turn out to be moses king david king solomon etc and he hears wonderful music and so on there are interviews or spoken bits with various relevant people anthony coleman talks a lot and there are some fascinating bits where he describes how his selfhaters music comes out of more familiar jewish contexts cant really describe it in words but it was both amusing and informative marc ribot talks in his slightly drug fucked way about a lot of things

7392443 si bien en la mayor parte de los casos el 29 ven a a sellar efectivamente un dominio claro sobre el distrito o un pacto entre notables din sticos en un porcentaje dif cil de precisar pero en todo caso significativo representa exactamente lo contrario de lo que se asume autom ticamente es decir la debilidad del grupo de poder dominante hasta el punto de reconocer a los opositores en el caso gallego siempre de matiz agrarista como interlocutores leg timos y firmar un acuerdo sobre la base del reparto de esferas de influencia

7392455 they havent killed the dog yet they dont want to back down but theyre feeling the heat
7392456 this is a pretty extreme use of government power to be able to knock on someones door take their dog away and kill it just because of its breed
7392457 but in my mind its 50 50 whatever i have to do to save my son
7392458 what the fuck how the fuck am i getting though that

7392461 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7392462 a lot of americans dont know who he is but his favorable rating is 13 points higher than his unfavorables but biden is not hillary clinton and its possible that is enough to have moved some of her supporters away from the democratic ticket at least temporarily

7392479 i was late in the morning for my first class so i picked any old underwear from my dresser
7392480 i was at a shower for a cousin of a cousin i didnt know many of the people there so i was sort of scanning the room for new people to talk with one of my aunts came up to me and introduced me to one of her co workers i stood up to shake her hand and we talked about nothing substantial lots of uncomfortable pauses you know what i mean my aunt walked away to help serve the potato salad and such and left me with this girl who had the personality of a rock not knowing what to say next i commented on how lovely her heart necklace was to this day i dont know why i did it but i lifted the necklace between my fingers very gently and im telling her how stunning it is it has been in the family for generations
7392481 i would have been here a half hour earlier but im having such a crazy day
7392482 im so bad about finishing projects on time i just hate myself
7392483 times i failed miserably trying to be something i am not

7392485 i got there at like 3ish and they werent filming we were like a few yards away from the set of the scene like behind a gate and chace was standing next to a water cooler talking to someone i think she was interviewing him

7392487 it matters a great deal because here we are trying to understand what has happened among men who live among books with books from books and so their words on books are also important
7392488 the biggest most unique contribution she makes is to constantly push me to keep moving forward on my agenda
7392489 maar zijn verhaal is mij iets te amerikaans hij lag in het ziekenhuis vocht tegen de kanker en iedere keer als hij moest overgeven gooide hij de zieke vijand er uit hij streed en overwon ik heb die periode heel anders beleefd eigenlijk heb ik alles lijdzaam ondergaan ik wil hier niet de indruk wekken dat ik zelf de ziekte heb overwonnen dat is niet zo
7392490 de mensen om me heen de dokters en medici hebben me genezen ik heb nooit hoeven vechten tegen kanker vandaag heb ik pas gevochten voor deze gouden medaille
7392491 een mindere kant van de filosofie van armstrong is dat hij bij de strijd tegen kanker het accent op het overwinnen van de ziekte legt het is een zaak van winnen of verliezen met andere woorden degenen die het niet redden zijn eigenlijk losers
7392492 uh vind je het echt grappig dus je bent niet boos snap hier niets van
7392493 maar je hoort toch altijd dat mensen dan pas weten wie hun chte vrienden zijn
7392494 ojee wat heb ik nu aan mijn fiets hangen hier wil ik niet bij betrokken zijn

7392496 during the dinner mary kate was very playful with joel it was all fun and games but with the olsens nothing is as simple as that nicole exploded at joel and demanded that they leave the party afterward nicole warned him to stay away from mary kate
7392497 nicole freaked out joel thought shed respect the fact that he was trying to be honest after all he and mary kate are just friends but nicole was hurt and angry he couldnt deal with it so he hung up and she kept texting him after that
7392498 shes been friends with mary kate for a while but she doesnt trust her at all when it comes to joel
7392499 they kept telling me push push push that was fun a lot of fun

7392501 the performance wasnt error free but when you look at the context and the fact the springboks were desperate it is a significant win
7392502 you only have to look at the carnage in the change rooms they did what had to be done and they did it the hard way they gutsed it out
7392503 the key now is whether we can back up next saturday there will be many who will be suggesting we cant and history would suggest that also but there is now a great opportunity this week to do what we want to achieve we know we will have to be better next week but we want to be better and we want to back up

7392595 this was june 10 and that was the time we had all that rain and it was really hot and humid so it was not a good day to bake brownies
7392596 this is the first cooking contest ive been to but it was pretty low key
7392597 i got to meet a few of the contestants and we were all pulling for each other i happened to meet a woman who was meeting down the row from us whos from hudsonville
7392598 we get so many wonderful and unique recipes that it is difficult to choose which one will take home the prize
7392599 i saw her brownies and i just had a feeling she would win
7392600 she was in the non chocolate category she used white chocolate and she had cut them with a michigan shaped cookie cutter
7392601 mine are so moist you can barely cut them on a good day much less a day that was hot and humid theyre practically glued to the knife so youre not going to be able to cut them in fancy shapes
7392602 get me to the beach fast traverse city cherry brownies
7392603 common ground how to stop the partisan war that is destroying america
7392604 a disastrous race david got involved in an incident in the first lap which damaged his car and mark who was on a one stop strategy was hoping for a safety car that never appeared he didnt have enough pace particularly after his pit stop its our most disappointing race of the year congratulations to sebastian vettel who drove very well today and demonstrated what the chassis is capable of
7392605 we just werent quick enough we were hoping for a few safety cars to come out during the race so ran a one stop strategy but it didnt happen it was a difficult race pace wise and weve got a lot of analysis to do
7392606 i was hit from behind on the first lap i came back and passed a couple of cars but when i tried to pass one of the force indias i aborted the manoeuvre and made contact with them so sorry to them for that that damaged my barge board and the side of the car so after that the balance and downforce were very poor
7392607 a poor result we were off the pace after qualifying we didnt really have any opportunity to bet on so we finished where we qualified we have poor pace and we just have to work
7392608 it was a fantastic race with a difficult strategic decision in the final phase all the more beautiful it is that we have now clinched a double victory in the american le mans series for the third time in succession proving vorsprung durch technik and this being achieved against very strong competition congratulations to the whole team also on prematurely clinching the manufacturers championships
7392609 that was a real challenge for me when i had to overtake almost all prototypes again at the end of the race it worked out well our car was not in a perfect shape after our little mishap in the pits and i really had to fight our engineer told me on the radio that i had to push like hell i did and fortunately it worked out
7392610 i ve not seen such a great race for quite a while it was really exciting it was nail biting because we were not sure if we could bring the victory home there were two different strategies for our two cars it s great that this gave us a 1 2 victory it was really close in the end for emanuele pirro who opted for the save fuel method we went flat out but had to pit under green i dedicate this victory to our boys who worked a lot this week and put a great car on the wheels for us
7392611 it was a difficult race because we gambled a little bit with the fuel from one side it was good because we really used the last drop of diesel that was in our tank this allowed us to finish second on the very last lap on the other side we lost the chance to fight for the victory as soon we had to back off and save fuel this was a little bit frustrating but it is a great result for audi and we enjoy it
7392612 i really learned to save fuel during the stint i was two steps of power down but this was not enough and i had to roll the car into the corners despite that my lap times were good enough to keep the lmp 2 cars behind i m not happy about the race result because we had a fast car but we gambled and didn t make it i m happy on how we managed the situation and i m happy about the way i drove i literally ran out of fuel at start and finish it was good to finish second in these conditions
7392613 it was definitely a team effort after rebuilding one car on friday all the way into the night because of a damaged monocoque the team performed extremely well and our four drivers were great the complete team did a great job i m very pleased
7392614 i got out of it so i dont have to worry about answering that question
7392615 its not what youd expect from woody i suppose i can understand the controversy but anyone going to see it for that reason will be disappointed
7392616 im not doing this for some sort of publicity stunt im in the position to have the ability to possibly make an influence
7392617 were contacted constantly by representatives or celebrities themselves the celebrities really see this as an opportunity to model the right kind of behavior

7392623 musicians in particular have this deep connection with their audience on an emotional level that really gets to the identity of the individuals
7392624 young people really define themselves with the music that they listen to when someone like dave matthews steps to the microphone and urges people to vote you cant even measure the impact fans are very very engaged and theyre not just feeding off of the musicians but theyre communicating with each other

7392629 this is the most cynical superficial campaign in indianas history
7392630 from bogus storefront offices to negative ads to the vp tease we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7392631 its very likely that the obama campaign looked at the polls and said even with evan bayh and the millions weve already spent we cant win indiana
7392632 this was a tough weekend from a lot of perspectives but a few things really standout when you have struggles like we did in sonoma primarily what a great job the crew did in getting the car back together it was an unfortunate weekend when things happen the crew spent long hours to get the car back together they stepped up never complained and did everything asked of them that is the silver lining in this cloud another is how so many other teams offered help and assistance it makes you proud to be in that kind of paddock the car was different in warm up than in qualifying and were not sure why the further we ran the worse the car got unlike most events the car just never came back to us even the changes at the first pit stop didnt make any difference when the axle failed it was the end of two really tough weekends but the crew hung tough and did a great job well do everything we can to reward that effort in these final two races with better results
7392633 it was bad luck for me because i could have won the gp but the safety and health of my riding colleagues must always be the first consideration
7392634 well you can say that im the one curly fry in the box of the regular
7392635 i am incredibly disappointed for the team the drivers and the fans for such a fantastic race being ended by the stewards in such a manner clearly for many many laps the 45 porsche blocked us continuously there were many incidents where we had been taken off the course and i was really proud of the patience that dirk showed and the racecraft he used at the end to force the 45 into a mistake the penalty is non protestable clearly it leaves a very bad taste in everybodys mouth we are racing those guys for a championship and it does seem that following the elkhart lake road america incident nothing was done and now there is a decision made against us clearly the obvious thing is to go home and fight again another day
7392636 my stint was good i could overtake the porsche in front of me and i took second position but by that time the 62 was already gone so i took the pace of the leading car my goal was to keep the 45 car behind me i did that i was very very happy with my stint i was quite happy to take the podium with dirk but i am very frustrated in the decision of the officials
7392637 from the second stop everything was under control i was in the pack the whole time and i knew i could not press like the no 62 race winning ferrari it was like 55 minutes of studying where i could pass the 45 car i thought five times i was ahead but he just went wide the last lap he made a mistake he covered the inside of turn 5a and i positioned myself on the outside he came sideways between 5a and 5b i jumped inside nice and clean we had contact but the contact was because he was closing the door it was a nice and clear move i had many chances to make a dirty move and i did not take them the last contact was avoidable on his side i am very disappointed in this decision by the officials
7392638 i would have felt more comfortable and confident with one more second a lap but i had to play the hand i was dealt i just tried to do the best job that i could to drive it into the window and give it to alex to finish up he went out there and just peeled them off i improved by one position and he improved by one position i was really happy to finish with a great result alex did a phenomenal job bringing it home
7392639 it was a great result the guys were great but i think i lost a little time on the pit stops i need to get the rhythm right on cranking the ignition as the car is dropping jim did a great job he made huge strides here i just cant say enough about that that was probably our biggest gain of the weekend i knew he was a little bit heartbroken to go down that lap in the end but with all that prototype traffic there isnt much you can do about it i am really looking forward to detroit

7392642 you have a good nose for sensing when i have a good hand
7392643 felipe has had an extraordinary weekend yesterday he was very quick in qualifying and today he drove in impeccable style without putting a foot wrong to take what was a very well deserved win after the disappointment of budapest i want to compliment him and the whole team who have worked so hard in preparing for this event unfortunately once again we have suffered with a reliability problem this time on kimis car which lost us precious points now we have to find out what happened in yet another engine failure and then decide how to react clearly what happened is serious and we will have to do all in our power to make up for the ground we have lost through reliability problems in the coming races now we must continue to push to the maximum to develop the car and improve reliability in order to be as well prepared as possible for the forthcoming races we still have two test sessions at monza and then jerez and a lot of hard days work in the factory finally i want to say a few words about piero timpini our mechanic unfortunately injured in kimis second pit stop his first words were to say sorry as though the incident was his fault it is thanks to the passion dedication and professionalism that these guys show on a daily basis for ferrari how special is our team
7392644 its fantastic having won this race especially after the disappointment of budapest the team did an amazing job in preparing for this grand prix and the benefits of that could be seen right from the very first day yesterday i got pole and today the win with the race fastest lap as the icing on the cake you cannot ask for more especially at my one hundredth grand prix with every single one of them powered by a ferrari engine i got a good start and i pushed to the maximum right from the early laps in the second part of the race the car was exceptional but also in the final stint when i had the softer tyres i could do the lap times easily this is an important moment in my career and i must continue to work in this way i am sorry for what happened to kimi we have to look very carefully at our reliability i am confident the team knows which countermeasures to take to react to this issue as it has always done in the past
7392645 not much to say after a day like this it was definitely not the weekend i was hoping for but i do not believe that despite this negative result i am now out of the running for the title there are still six races to go and sixty points up for grabs we have seen that the situation change really quickly even if i realize things are now more complicated today i lost a place at the start and i was stuck in traffic for all of the first stint then when i had a clear track ahead of me i was able to push and was doing good lap times at the second pit stop i made a mistake and left before i should have done fortunately pietro timpini is not too badly hurt i wish him all the best and hope he gets better soon in any case it would not have changed anything as then the engine broke now we must concentrate on preparing for the next rounds and on improving our qualifying performance
7392646 a great performance from felipe all weekend long he was fantastic and deserves all our praise unfortunately yet again we were not reliable both from a technical point of view and in how we operated on the track given what happened during raikkonens pit stop and then the failure of his engine which initial investigations seem to point at a similar failure to the one felipe experienced in hungary fortunately pietro timpini the mechanic operating the refueling injured at kimis second stop got away with just a small fracture to the left foot and it is not particularly serious today we have seen two sides of the coin we have a great potential from both the team and the car capable of putting us in front of everyone else but if not all elements are operating at their optimum then we are throwing away precious points that could cost us dear we must work to remedy these problems and thats what we will do starting in the days that follow
7392647 i cant complain with second place today this was a strong weekend for us despite my having a few problems health wise but we pulled through the track was pretty difficult to overtake on but i maintained the gap our lap times showed that our overall pace was good which was encouraging heikki and i scored 13 points today which is very positive for the team so i d describe it as a satisfactory weekend for us
7392648 my start was good and i was consequently able to overtake kimi before the first corner however i m not really happy with how the race went for me after that because i had grip problems with the prime tyres in the first and second stints whereas with the option tyres in the last stint i had much better grip and traction as a result i could close the gap to robert kubica a little at least i scored five points but a podium would have been much nicer having said that it s good that the team scored a lot of points with lewis s second place and my fourth place
7392649 we saw another extremely solid vodafone mclaren mercedes team performance today the result of which was a very useful clutch of championship points but in truth we lost the chance of outright victory yesterday in qualifying in my view its pretty clear that if lewis had qualified with the same level of fuel as felipe hed probably have been able to control the race from the front but the nature of the circuit dictated that it was always going to be difficult for him to overtake today and that being the case we opted fairly early on to take the championship strategic option of settling for second place following on from his victory in hungary heikki also drove very strongly and helped bolster our points total in the constructors championship he responded well to the pressure applied by kimi and thoroughly deserved his fourth place
7392650 i am quite satisfied lewis leads the drivers world championship six points ahead of felipe and 13 ahead of kimi no other team scored more points than we did today we reduced the gap in the constructors and extended the lead in the drivers rankings congratulations to felipe and ferrari on their strong race and victory the first grand prix here in valencia was a great premiere thank you to the organisers and to bernie this grand prix most certainly set an example the most positive element was that the boxes containing our spare parts were kept closed all weekend we didn t need to fit a single replacement part throughout a race weekend that everybody thought might be full of crashes we will now continue to work hard in order to be well prepared for the final third of the season which will begin with back to back races at spa and monza two particularly challenging circuits that will put maximum stress on the engines
7392651 this has turned into one of those good weekends after qualifying everybody was a bit disappointed but today went much better due to excellent teamwork after jarno missed saturdays practice session the crew put timos set up into jarnos car and he delivered a very good performance and a very smooth race to 5th place today timo was not feeling well but he made an excellent start managed his tyres well and put in a huge effort to complete this race with the best result im very happy that we are confirming our good pace now we will push to keep these results coming with a particular eye on the japanese grand prix later in the season
7392652 that was a good result and a great performance by the team the weekend started badly for me but it has finished really well today so im happy i could drive a strong race without attacking much i pushed very hard when i needed to while paying attention to taking care of my tyres and my brakes throughout this shows how good we are getting and how nice it is to race with a competitive car every weekend toyota is doing a very good job this year and looking strong and more competitive at every circuit the team is still pushing with the development work so im confident that we can maintain the form in the coming races and keep the points coming
7392653 that was one of my hardest races ever because i have had a bad cold for the last two days but i had a good car and the right strategy and i think p7 was the best result we could have achieved today so im really happy i made up some places at the start and then just tried to do my race it was tough in the middle of the race and in the last 10 laps i pushed as hard as i could to stay concentrated considering our qualifying and my condition i am happy its a great result for the team to get both cars into the points for the constructors championship

7392673 o que aqui est em causa a vontade do presidente da rep blica de afirmar uma esp cie de inevitabilidade do casamento a ideia de que o div rcio deve ser t o excepcional que deve ser obstaculizado
7392674 temos uma vis o cr tica desta lei que confunde onde devia esclarecer e complica onde devia simplificar
7392675 tem que haver viol ncia agress o qualquer outra forma de conflito o ps tentou disfar ar a sobreviv ncia de uma no o de culpa
7392676 levant mos essa quest o durante a discuss o na especialidade o projecto abre uma caixa de pandora ao tentar reduzir isso a valores mercantis
7392677 o ps criou esse problema tem de dar subst ncia a essas quest es do ponto de vista regulamentar
7392678 they are using an illegal list the election commission which is custodian of the conduct of elections is willfully violating the law
7392679 obviously two races in spain and two retirements with the engine in barcelona and incident with nakajima here
7392680 its a real disappointment and we need to think forward to spa and see if our luck can change finally
7392681 we tried to go out just for the fans and repair the car just for those people who came just to see me racing but when we evaluated the damage it was to the suspension and gearbox too not just the rear wing so we couldnt go out again
7392682 i didnt see him i was driving down the pit lane and suddenly the car was there and i had to go left to avoid him
7392683 obviously i tried to let him past as soon as i could after the pit lane everyone is in such a rush in the pits and weve seen cars side by side in the pits many time
7392684 two speed boats chased and opened fire at the japanese operated ship a suspected mother ship was in the vicinity but the japanese ship managed to escape after the captain increased speed and took evasive maneuvers
7392685 it appears pirates are still trying to hijack ships in the location
7392686 we have made very clear to the u n envoy that the mission should not discuss the upcoming 2010 elections as the nld does not recognize the military backed constitution
7392687 the u n envoy was wasting his time on matters that he was not supposed to deal with
7392688 four years will be disastrous for the economy the political system the judiciary
7392689 it is impossible for him to get even one lawmaker let alone 30
7392690 number one you have a situation where the election was stolen from you number two there is no direction no leadership can you imagine with this leadership this policy this crime rate this economy can the country manage and survive for four years
7392691 my point is we will lose a lot if we wait for four years
7392692 we still say we are the underdogs it is a matter of whether the majority would be reduced
7392693 from the start there have been so many obstacles to stop him from contesting
7392694 we see rampant corruption in the government we hope anwar wins and brings good changes
7392695 theyre scampering and leaving only token forces to delay our advance
7392696 there is fighting that erupts in new places almost every day so more and more are being displaced so we are hoping that there can be a peaceful resolution very quickly
7392697 we cannot subject our members to the laws of the government
7392698 theres a huge difference in whats allowed now compared to five years ago
7392699 i dont think an outright ban is still sensible because this is how people communicate on the web in daily life
7392700 so weve got to allow political videos with some safeguards
7392701 now theres a buffer between the police and the artists
7392702 before the mda came about it was more high handed we would just get a letter that would say take this line out take this paragraph out now we can negotiate
7392703 race and religion remain powerful and emotional subjects especially in our multiracial society
7392704 such issues should continue to be dealt with and presented sensitively
7392705 i wanted to expose the founding myth as a myth
7392706 its a way of attacking some of the myths of today the pap very much rules as a neocolonial government placing order and morality above all
7392707 theater only challenges the mindsets of a limited middle class audience
7392708 the government still doesnt believe the people are mature enough to give completely uncensored views
7392709 but i think singapore has reached a stage that it does not need limitations
7392710 over the past years performance guidelines have changed in tandem with community needs and expectations
7392711 as our society matures we can accommodate more debates and exploration of issues
7392712 you cannot have a society that has been economically progressing for 50 years and not expect it to become much more complex educated and demanding
7392713 they know what public opinion is and they know what the cost would be if they continue to be stubborn
7392714 wait let me call my spouse downstairs to join us
7392715 tell me why you feel so strongly about not allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry could you help me understand why you believe that extending legal marriage to include same sex couples would harm or threaten your marriage family and children
7392716 my parents taught me through their lives what a marriage could be
7392717 my mom and dad defined marriage for me in their love fidelity and devotion to one another what they taught me about love through loving one another was the greatest gift they ever gave me as their daughter
7392718 well it looks like your vote will cancel mine and my vote will cancel yours
7392719 clarks essentially a good person and deep down im not
7392720 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
7392721 clarks essentially a good person and deep down im not
7392722 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
7392723 i was excited to get the text message but i wasnt about to call my friends at 2 43 in the morning to tell them who obama picked
7392724 i didnt sign up for the text message or anything like that so when they started talking about biden i almost kicked them out of the car
7392725 i thought if they knew about it i would have found out right away
7392726 i would have liked to see obama pick sebelius i think were due for a woman in the white house
7392727 shes shown she can work with republicans and get things done
7392728 when biden said giuliani based his campaign on a noun a verb and 9 11 it pretty much ended his campaign
7392729 he has a sharp tongue and is very quick witted
7392730 he came up to me and shook my hand and asked my name and for the next five minutes i had him and could tell he wasnt worried about anything other than our conversation
7392731 we are looking to save in about every place we can we are a lot more careful with the meals well travel less players to some places its a heavy burden
7392732 it would probably cost us 80 000 to fly to siu footballs game at northwestern university versus 15 000 to bus there
7392733 now on other years we may have talked about flying there but we are trying to save some money here
7392734 buses food and hotels definitely have an impact but the economy has risen so you try to do the best you can and try to conserve where you can
7392735 getting there sleeping there and getting home is expensive but if you are traveling with equipment for example some airlines are charging surcharges for each extra suitcase
7392736 basketball travels with a few bags for example and softball travels with a bunch of bags
7392737 like any business we are always searching to make ourselves more lean
7392738 we want to cut out the fat but no muscle at our retreat for example we were taking a long hard look at the usage of our office supplies and it may sound like a small thing but if we can shave of 5 000 to 10 000 it could help when it comes to total costs
7392739 as our success rate goes up we are finding it is harder to get people to play us
7392740 you dont want to schedule a horrible game close because you have to think about your strength of schedule and your rpi
7392741 the problem is that you have to travel to be in a conference
7392742 what it has done is forced us to really look at regionalizing the schedule most sports do a good job of playing the murray states and the semos of the world
7392743 basketball is really a different animal because we cant just play any school football is just so far advanced the reality is we are waiting to see the results of it but in looking at all our sports i dont see all our sports just jetting to places and playing in these tournaments
7392744 if fuel prices can get back under control its like 3 60 something now i expect to see some of those savings come back
7392745 what happened here to john and the association never needed to happen but what happened will never be forgotten
7392746 even though wed like to have that stay here at siu the future is a bit cloudy at this point
7392747 as was the case in france we have in this instance been confronted with unfair charges against a great man and a truly truly shocking affront to basic principles of procedural due process and justice
7392748 as far as im concerned im simply doing what ive done whenever professor simons been away im merely filling in for a legend
7392749 our talent level at the university of north dakota wasnt always the greatest but we had guys that really bought into the system
7392750 you can learn from anybody coaches that coached 25 to 30 years or from 5 to 10 years
7392751 you dont always have to go to 3 4 teams to learn more about defense
7392752 look at what those guys do and theyre not scared of doing things that could potentially give them the upper hand
7392753 i believe that hillary will continue to do a great job as a prominent leader of our country and i am confident barack will do the same as president of the united states of america
7392754 im not surprised that hes a delegate at this point and i wont be surprised to see him move on in politics
7392755 its a great opportunity to interact with people who weve all seen on television and read about in the newspapers
7392756 this election is not about senator obama or senator clinton anymore it is about senator john mccain
7392757 i do know that had i not met dean mcneil i would not be in this position
7392758 it was her connections that got me here and in many other places
7392759 members of congress nuns war heroes and other suspicious characters with names like robert johnson and gary smith
7392760 we are just competing against each other and having fun
7392761 its a lot of work but anything worthwhile is a lot of work
7392762 i think its a good cause we really enjoy it
7392763 kill earned a lot of respect for the community and we will continue supporting the cause
7392764 i think when i graduate i will feel the accomplishment
7392765 right now im just focused on each game and i dont see the overall picture im sure when its over i will be able to see what ive done
7392766 im the first person to play all four years in college but i think it will be broken ive done what ive needed to do some days im above my average and some days im behind but i do think some day it will be broken
7392767 she works very hard shes come from a very good program im glad she was able to break the record and do very well
7392768 i think thats why records are made i think they give you something to look forward to and it gives you motivation to do well im just happy for her i think its great
7392769 i dont think there will be any direct impact on his role on city council
7392770 im sure he will handle it in a professional manner
7392771 i think that its kind of unfair for 19 groups to be funded a half million dollars when we have a little over 400 groups
7392772 what were dealing with now is just basically the result of errors errors across the board
7392773 i dont see anything that screams or even suggests favoritism
7392774 usg had to do what they had to do were not the only organization that needs money
7392775 its not that were not capable of handling the money we just have to hold people accountable
7392776 and thats what the problem was last year people were just letting things go by and you have to put people in the offices who are going to take responsibility for their actions
7392777 it would be upsetting if students would feel that were incapable of distributing money that comes out of our pockets
7392778 i guarantee when may 2009 comes and my term is up you wont see this
7392779 i believe nightclubs have a life cycle usually two to three years
7392780 nightclubs change names change styles and change images it just has to be done in the nightclub business
7392781 you can be laid back in the martini bar and then dance and have fun in the main bar
7392782 its pretty much sin still i dont like hip hop anyway so i could care less
7392783 once i made the decision to give it there wasnt one piece i had a hard time letting go
7392784 its probably going to be appraised in the tens of thousands
7392785 in the museum we dont talk about the value of pieces
7392786 the biggest change is that elections have gone from party led campaigns to a candidate led campaign and thats unfortunate
7392787 im pretty sure she was just trying to get into the van
7392788 working in the basement provides a lot more freedom and no time constraints but well still take the time in l a
7392789 i was afraid the residents would prefer one ra over another
7392790 if you dont click with one ra you now have another chance
7392791 i think one can do the job but the year just started so you never know
7392792 not only do the students get the attention from ras but the ras get more attention from us
7392793 its more than producing more food its about how we can change the quality to make it healthier
7392794 there are a lot of opportunities for students to participate in clubs and activities
7392795 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
7392796 if there is no peace then it is because weve forgotten that we belong to each other
7392797 he continues to impact the game and well take it we need it hes stepped in and been a valuable member of our ballclub
7392798 looked like he just got done with a 15 round fight
7392799 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
7392800 once i made the decision to give it there wasnt one piece i had a hard time letting go
7392801 its probably going to be appraised in the tens of thousands
7392802 in the museum we dont talk about the value of pieces
7392803 the biggest change is that elections have gone from party led campaigns to a candidate led campaign and thats unfortunate
7392804 i may have to get more shirts made because i just like to have it on
7392805 either get behind our troops or get in front of them
7392806 the nation which forgets its defenders will itself be forgotten
7392807 if i dont know what im doing im sure they will if they dont know what theyre doing im sure i will were always going to be there on the same page and im sure thatll help a lot
7392808 ive grown up around it so im pretty used to it by now hes been pretty much a role model for me the military has been what ive wanted to do since i was real little
7392809 i feel as though i have a service to my country that i have to fulfill
7392810 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
7392811 it was the perfect week the perfect races couldnt ask for anything else
7392812 hard to imagine but this is a great start its going to be amazing im kind of at a loss for words because i was like oh you know i wonder how many people are going to be there im staring down this street of people just packed together its one of the coolest things ive ever experienced
7392813 the search for happiness is one of the chief sources of unhappiness
7392814 one cannot divine nor forecast the conditions that will make happiness one only stumbles upon them
7392815 we are never happy we can only remember that we were so once
7392816 ask yourself whether you are happy and you cease to be so
7392817 happiness is a mystery like religion and should never be rationalised
7392818 the consciousness or even the suspicion of having done wrong is a load upon every mind and is accompanied with anxiety and terror in all those who are not hardened by long habits of iniquity
7392819 there is no duty we so much underrate as the duty of being happy
7392820 martha martha thou art careful and troubled about many things but one thing is needful and mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her
7392821 imaginary evil is romantic and varied real evil is gloomy monotonous barren boring imaginary good is boring real good is always new marvelous intoxicating
7392822 what a wonderful life ive had i only wish id realized it sooner
7392823 it is easy to be heavy hard to be light
7392824 a mans first care should be to avoid the reproaches of his own heart
7392825 for the love of god and my sisters so charitable toward me i take care to appear happy and especially to be so
7392826 all severity that does not tend to increase good or prevent evil is idle
7392827 i must do the work that i am best suited for
7392828 my subject is simply life as i have experienced it and i am happiest when i am writing of things i know
7392829 suddenly amazingly a train came in it was a wooden third class local train the peasantsflung themselves to their feet and ran madly from carriage to carriage the doors were locked they climbed in through the glassless windows hauling one another up by arms and legs until the carriages were choked then they climbed on to the roof while some were still only half in and half on the train suddenly moved out bunches of people fell off like lice others ran along the line yelling madly from one of the bridges came the crackle of rifle fire the peasants panicked back to the platform and huddled against the wall
7392830 die zeit ist gekommen die verbitterung die engherzigkeit und den rger ber das was in washington passiert endlich zu berwinden und anstelle dessen m ssen wir eine gro e koalition der ver nderung setzen mit der wir demokratisch und republikanische staaten erreichen und wenn uns das glaubhaft gelingt werden wir die wahlen im november gewinnen und als nation die herausforderungen in der zukunft bew ltigen
7392831 wenn man den weg verfolgt den er als politiker bisher gegangen ist dann ist er doch viel traditioneller als das was er verspricht zu sein n mlich ein politiker der neuen art
7392832 die chinesische wirtschaft wird sich durch die olympischen spiele nicht abk hlen
7392833 die eigentlichen probleme sind einheimische faktoren wie inflation die sich verschlechternde weltwirtschaftliche umgebung und der exportr ckgang verursacht durch die wertsteigerung des yuan
7392834 nach den olympischen spielen wird sich die ffentliche aufmerksamkeit auf die expo 2010 in schanghai verlagern
7392835 theres not a liberal america and a conservative the united states of america
7392836 can yall just give me a moment to use the port o let
7392837 obama took it to a whole other level his message was fresh his voice was new his rhetoric was different nobody has taken all that light and heat and energy and directed it toward a run as much as he has
7392838 you look for people who are interesting you look for some geographic spread you look for demographic diversity and you look for big states or swing states
7392839 for the 10 to 15 percent of americans who casually pay attention to politics this is when you put your best foot forward and your best argument
7392840 i would be advising speakers to you know tell the truth give them hell
7392841 when the imagination of the future is as strong as the memory of the past at that moment we are free
7392842 recent history suggests that there is a better than even chance well be misled by the post convention bounces in 2008
7392843 content delivery networks cdns such as akamai and mirror image place web server clusters in numerous geographical locations to improve the responsiveness and locality of the content it hosts for end users however their services are priced out of reach for all but the largest enterprise customers an alternative approach to content delivery could be achieved by leveraging existing infrastructure provided by storage cloud providers at a fraction of the cost in this paper we introduce metacdn a system that exploits storage cloud resources creating an integrated overlay network that provides a low cost high performance cdn for content creators metacdn removes the complexity of dealing with multiple storage providers by intelligently matching and placing users content onto one or many storage providers based on their quality of service coverage and budget preferences we then demonstrate the utility of this new approach to content delivery by showing that the participating storage clouds used by metacdn provide high performance in terms of throughput and response time and reliable content delivery for content consumers
7392844 its a great opportunity to share a slice of life in small town america in the midst of an engaging democratic process
7392845 im sure well learn a lot in the process and so will arabs about us
7392846 its summer and its a low stress thing to do with the kids as long as theres a porta potty
7392847 we have a ball its so much fun when im on the bottom and shes four stories on top
7392848 fbi couple offered sex with 5 year old girl for used car
7392849 im struggling im a single mom part time student and part time employee
7392850 she needs everything right now so im going without right now
7392851 the computer will not give you what youre not eligible for according to our rules
7392852 theres always mixed emotions because we campaigned hard for hillary but we campaigned harder to elect a democrat
7392853 we need to have a strong united front and take back the white house
7392854 its up to us now to say get with it
7392855 the one thing were focused on is hillary clintons legacy and doing the right thing
7392856 we went through a process that is all fair and square i think were going to leave this convention very unified you can see the handwriting on the wall
7392857 we have two younger kids in the house and i thought it would be helpful
7392858 the location whether its in the library or whether its in the sports arena or whether its in the back of the garage it doesnt really matter
7392859 i dont think the location will make any difference whatsoever
7392860 the location is terrific its virtually adjacent to our high school campus
7392861 thats all closed off and really doesnt exist unless we decide to go over for skating
7392862 eventually wed like to expand it into a year round school situation
7392863 taliban militants attacked the house of the brother of a ruling party mp with rockets
7392864 eight people have been killed and four others are injured
7392865 get out of the vehicle get out of the vehicle
7392866 mujahedeen of islamic emirate of afghanistan with remote controlled landmine blew up a military tank of canadian occupation army when it was travelling in demrasi area of panjwaii district in kandahar province
7392867 in the explosion the tank was completely destroyed and four occupation terrorists were killed
7392868 if the protecteur and preserver are going to be needed longer than expected we will also determine what needs to be done to keep our supply ships safe operational and available until they can be replaced
7392869 many of their systems are nearly obsolete such as the boilers they use to generate steam for main propulsion as you might expect its becoming increasingly difficult and costly to maintain these ships spare parts are no longer readily available and the skills needed to operate and maintain systems that were already mature in the 1960s are becoming increasingly rare
7392870 current international conventions require comparable commercial ships tankers to have double hulls and canadian environmental policy aims where feasible for warships to incorporate the highest pollution prevention standards
7392871 the bidders were significantly over the budget so we just cut the process and were looking at the next steps
7392872 we want to have the best value for taxpayers dollars the budget is a major consideration and we have to act responsibly
7392873 new supply ships for the navy and the 12 additional mid shore patrol vessels for the coast guard are not simply luxury items but are essential to the successful day to day operations
7392874 uma fraude pol tica que vegeta entre a inexist ncia p blica e a parasitagem s desloca es dos dirigentes nacionais regi o
7392875 this is an invention by mr harper to try to trigger an election before he loses the byelections
7392876 a few days ago he just called a fourth byelection in don valley west its taxpayers money
7392877 this is full improvisation and it shows panic from the prime minister
7392878 canadians will certainly give a lot of interest to their own federal politics
7392879 because it really attracts people going by in need of a home the signs swing back and forth and i havent seen any other homes that have that advertisement like this one does
7392880 probably 100 bucks for gas in the two days and usually if you eat out youre looking at 200 300 bucks
7392881 we call it the sports capitol of the northwest and were also a second home for the wiaa
7392882 its a good event for yakima brings people together something to do
7392883 wine tasting is not something theyre thinking about so basically it doesnt help us one way or the other
7392884 get out of the vehicle get out of the vehicle
7392885 mujahedeen of islamic emirate of afghanistan with remote controlled landmine blew up a military tank of canadian occupation army when it was travelling in demrasi area of panjwaii district in kandahar province
7392886 in the explosion the tank was completely destroyed and four occupation terrorists were killed
7392887 the surveillance system picked up a problem that was occurring and allowed us to respond efficiently and effectively to an emerging public health issue
7392888 this is an example of where our surveillance system worked
7392889 in those terms certainly i think this was a success
7392890 when theres a loss of life involved it is always tragic it should force us to review our protocols review how we deal with things and see if there are better ways we can do things
7392891 but once we were award of the situation federal officials acted very quickly
7392892 we felt given the new information we had to take the most conservative approach possible and recalled 100 per cent of the production from the entire facility
7392893 we have an unwavering commitment to keeping our food safe with the standards that go well beyond regulatory requirements
7392894 but this week our best efforts failed and for that we are deeply sorry
7392895 while these results are highly significant and indicate the investigation is on the right path the investigation is not complete
7392896 were probably looking at another three to four weeks of vigilance
7392897 the ui fund could become insolvent if no action is taken
7392898 everybodys watching whats going on in beijing right now with the olympics

7392932 positively one of the weakest students to pass our way and received consistently poor marks and a number of dangerous down grades assigned by more than one instructor he had no real ability and was clearly out of his element in an airplane and way over his head even as a junior naval officer
7392933 the party state was clearly a winner in the eyes of the people
7392934 it is a total breakthrough we did a perfect job on security and provided good services to all the athletes
7392935 ultimately we look forward to a debate between joe biden and barack obama about whether barack obama has the judgment and experience to lead
7392936 the choice on iraq in this election is clear and compelling
7392937 joe biden believes the war was a mistake john mccain would still do it all over again joe biden knows the bush mccain policy has weakened our hand fighting terrorism and finding osama bin laden john mccain started beating the drums for war after september 11th and wants to double down on the bush policy for four more years if barack obama and joe biden had set iraq policy these last six years rather than george bush and john mccain we wouldnt be in the hole were in today
7392938 the president always has the right to act preemptively if we are in imminent danger if they are coming up over the hill he can respond if troops are coming out of tijuana heading north we can respond if they are coming down from toronto we can respond if missiles are on their way we can respond but that is not the way i hear it being used here we are talking about preemption as if we are adopting a policy
7392939 the power of the purse is useless because it presents us with a hobsons choice
7392940 we have our fighting men and women in place and we are told by the way the president will not take them home so lets cut off the support for them so they have no guns no bullets no ability to fight a war and no one is willing to do that
7392941 i play the villain of the piece alec durberville which is good because i generally play saints and do gooders
7392942 ive gone to the dark side and its much more fun
7392943 playing characters who are wonderful and beautiful is hard because you dont feel like that most of the time well i dont
7392944 its like this whole heart throb nonsense its flattering but thats not how i feel in the morning its something that goes with the job
7392945 she has this presence on the screen that is mesmerising gemma is a very bonnie girl and like keira you do get a sense she is going places
7392946 shes got so much fire in her she is so much more than a bond girl
7392947 dont discourse us about stipendiary for what we have after all weve got money even if we also have huge debts
7392948 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7392949 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7392950 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region
7392951 there werent many models where you could go to do this i did it intuitively i have four people in the office and five people at the house and i dont even have a job why it takes that many people to sustain me is hard to explain they have been with me for a long time which makes things run smoothly because they know my habits and predilections
7392952 family offices come in all different kinds of sizes shapes and flavors
7392953 its usually dictated by what a family wants and the skill set they need to run their office
7392954 the scottish government supports his argument the government of northern ireland agrees as do many others across europe they share our concerns and like us are prepared to stand up and be counted scotland does not need gm crops scotland does not want gm crops and scotland should not have gm crops scottish agriculture and exporters are better off without them and so is the environment right across our planet
7392955 if an action or policy might cause severe or irreversible harm to the public or to the environment in the absence of a scientific consensus that harm would not ensue the burden of proof falls on those who would advocate taking the action
7392956 mccain crusade strategist mark salter said monday period that mccain was technically disabled tortured for his land that is how he acquired his disability salter said
7392957 many had no education no self worth until they went to the ccc camps they learned how to take care of themselves they learned a skill it could have been maybe mechanics love of nature and they learned discipline and they learned how to respect each other

7392961 ive been a strong ethanol supporter because illinois is a major corn producer
7392962 a product whose profits accrue to a small group of corporate corn growers led by illinois headquartered archer daniels midland
7392963 on condition of anonymity one washington lobbyist i spoke with was willing to point out the obvious that big donors would not be helping out obama if they didnt see him as a player
7392964 the lobbyist added whats the dollar value of a starry eyed idealist
7392965 well they never really did anything so we dont know if it would have gone beyond the fantasy stage
7392966 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7392967 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on the type of spit for the task at hand
7392968 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7392969 if it was proved they cheated we would have a right to be upset
7392970 it is something that potentially would be in breach of our code of conduct
7392971 if appropriate it would be looked into it depends on the evidence and circumstances
7392972 cest une bonne deuxi me place pour moi le but du jeu tait de me rassurer avant de partir pour le tour de l le maurice cest fait je sais que les jambes tournent bien
7392973 en t te t te je savais que j tais plus rapide que brice au sprint il fallait absolument quil ne me l che pas dans les derniers kilom tres

7392976 theyre very quick in midfield and they came at us with zullo and reinaldo coming on
7392977 they were buzzing and they caught us napping i guess
7392978 they put us under the pump for a little while
7392979 we started to win the midfield and we started to play again
7392980 at the start of the second half matty mckay and massimo murdocca were getting a heap of the ball and it was allowing them to come at us
7392981 but once we got that under control we started to play a bit better
7392982 really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
7392983 it is striking how unqualified sen barack obama is and and how this whole thing came about with within the democrat
7392984 its perfect affirmative action and because of all this guilt and the historic nature of things nobody had the guts to say well wait a minute do we really want to do this
7392985 joe will help me navigate through the partisanship in washington
7392986 saint louis pour quelques semaines encore cest insupportable on le sait moi m me jai mis trois quarts dheure pour sortir de l cole paul eluard et arriver la mairie mardi pour lessentiel cette situation tient au fait que la sortie de la ville vers qui se fait beaucoup par la rue du g n ral de gaulle et la travers e de plateau maison rouge est en travaux il y a eu de la part de l quipe municipale pr c dente un gros effort de travaux routiers pour pr s de 10 millions deuros la rue du ouaki la rue fran ois de mahy la rue samuel treuthard bref un programme routier important tous ces travaux sach vent dans quelques semaines par la rue du g n ral de gaulle en attendant cest tr s difficile mais sit t finis les travaux de cette rue essentielle la circulation redeviendra normale cest dire difficile
7392987 il faut que la population qui va vers la rivi re et vers cilaos ne transite plus en ville pour cela il y a plusieurs projets le premier projet est de donner de la p rennit la sortie de la rivi re vers saint pierre travers le radier du ouaki nous avons l un projet dam nagement du radier pour quil ne puisse plus tre ferm que dans les cas extr mes pour des probl mes de s curit dautre part on a fait le pont de aujourdhui cest 15 minutes depuis jusquau tampon dici deux trois ans rivi re saint louis tampon a ne doit plus tre par pierrefonds ou par saint louis ensuite vous avez le barreau qui avait t promis par le pr sident lagourgue quand on a fait l changeur du bel air quand vous tes sur l changeur du bel air il y a une bretelle qui ne sert rien qui descend vers la rivi re cette bretelle doit recevoir une route deux voies qui utilise la berge de la rivi re sainte etienne passe sous les ouvrages nationaux sous les ponts pour rejoindre derri re l cole robert debr la route de cilaos
7392988 oui mais cest la premi re fois que les services de l quipement les dessinent je pense que nous sommes l en train de faire un grand pas enfin jai oubli de vous rappeler que une fois le radier actuel deux voies du fond de la rivi re saint tienne remplac nous aurons un ouvrage quatre voies qui donnera de la permanence la route saint denis saint pierre le pont actuel celui qui a r sist et qui est le pont historique b ti il y a un si cle par ceux qui ont fait le chemin de fer servira au tram train et une circulation interne entre pierrefonds et saint louis il sera par voie de cons quence lentr e officielle de la ville de saint louis
7392989 nous ne sommes pas favorables ce projet de rocade qui partait de la rivi re la hauteur dexpo bois et qui traversait sur les hauteurs de plateau goyaves puis roche maigre puis le gol travaux pharaoniques puisquil faut faire deux ouvrages comparables ceux de la route des tamarins cette rocade communale tait irr aliste
7392990 the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money
7392991 we had to take a team to a match in tianjin
7392992 he said it wasnt possible i said the girls couldnt wait until tianjin he shook his head so i got angry and said if the bus didnt stop there would be an international incident the girls would use the bus as a toilet
7392993 if you go back 12 months brand china was in tremendous difficulties with toxic toys and a number of other issues
7392994 chinas amazing haul of gold medals has mirrored its spectacular economic growth to signal to the world that china has truly arrived
7392995 from the grandeur of the opening ceremony to the self assured way chinese athletes expected to win in so many events china exceeded every expectation
7392996 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making
7392997 however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete had reservations about touring there which could not be removed in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7392998 it was agreed pakistan would retain the right to host the event next year but that if at a certain time any members still had reservations then the iccs board would have the right to relocate the event
7392999 india were quite influential in persuading some other nations that that was the right course of action
7393000 cricket is not going to die here in pakistan its just that we are going through a difficult phase
7393001 we would have lost the hosting rights had the champions trophy been relocated to sri lanka
7393002 it made little sense to organize a four team competition
7393003 typically you will see the word cuckold mentioned in couples where a dominant female takes on an additional partner to humiliate her husbands but this is not always the case quite often you will find that the male partner in a couple willingly takes on a cuckold role as he simply enjoys watching his wive having sex with other men
7393004 a man whos political partner is unfaithful or publicly humiliating towards him
7393005 it seems to me that theres a kind of hear no progress in iraq see no progress in iraq and most of all speak of no progress in iraq
7393006 if you have an important point to make dont try to be subtle or clever use a pile driver hit the point once then come back and hit it again then hit it a third time a tremendous whack
7393007 a wise mans heart directs him towards the right but the foolish mans heart directs him towards the left
7393008 i dont know about you but i have had it with the d c democrats had it with the dlc democrats had it with every calculating equivocating triangulating straddling hair splitting son of a bitch up there and that includes hillary rodham clinton
7393009 the road to hell like the road to its sister city washington d c is paved with good intentions
7393010 republicans have a post 9 11 worldview and many democrats have a pre 9 11 worldview that doesnt make them unpatriotic not at all but it does make them wrong deeply and profoundly and consistently wrong
7393011 when the eagles are silent the parrots begin to jabber
7393012 the first amendment of the constitution was not written to protect the people of this country from religious values it was written to protect religious values from government tyranny
7393013 today we are committed to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the right of all who wish to be free
7393014 i dont make jokes i just watch the government and report the facts
7393015 the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants it is its natural manure
7393016 i have sworn before the alter of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man
7393017 the only stable state is the one in which men are equal before the law

7393021 using proteopedia anyone can easily create descriptions of biomacromolecules linked to their 3d structure
7393022 we are presenting proteopedia to the scientific community to judge its usefulness and merit
7393023 we truly hope that it will offer an effective and appealing way to convey the link between 3d structure and function
7393024 cest parfois tr s dur pour les enfants de se s parer de leurs parents cest donc nous de les mettre suffisamment en confiance pour quils aient envie de rester l cole
7393025 cest linstituteur qui d cide des activit s du jour mais je ne suis pas inactive pour autant cest moi par exemple qui dois mettre en place le mat riel pour ces activit s cest moi aussi qui guide les enfants je pr pare je range je nettoie mes t ches sont nombreuses cest beaucoup de responsabilit mais heureusement tout se fait naturellement et sans stress
7393026 m me lorsque les enfants font des simples activit s d veil en classe il faut les surveiller ils peuvent tout moment tre tent s davaler quelque chose ou risquent de se blesser avec une simple paire de ciseaux il faut donc rester en alerte permanente
7393027 cet ge cest essentiel dapprendre lhygi ne cest pour cela que nous travaillons beaucoup sur ce point il faut par exemple apprendre aux petits manger proprement ou encore se servir des toilettes
7393028 cest important pour plus tard si on ne le fait pas lorsquils sont petits ils auront du mal pendant toute leur scolarit
7393029 au d but de lann e on les d couvre et on apprend les conna tre la fin quand ils nous quittent on se rend compte quils sont un peu plus autonomes quils mangent comme des grands ou quils se sentent mieux en groupe cest gratifiant et lorsquils nous quittent on a un petit pincement au c ur mais nous avons peine le temps de les voir partir pour une autre classe quil faut d j accueillir de nouveaux
7393030 it was a reflection of how much the guys gave physically to secure that victory and also that our feet are firmly planted on the ground
7393031 our mindset is to hopefully get up for the challenge next week and if we do that then hopefully that might be an opportunity for us to win it a couple of weeks after that
7393032 the springboks were desperate the intensity and the desperation was high but the boys got up and you look at history i guess and thats an indication of how hard it is to win here they knew what had to be done and they did it the hard way
7393033 we are pleased but i guess the key now is can we back up there would be many who would suggest we cant and history would suggest that also we have a great opportunity to do that this week and thats what well concentrate on
7393034 since the last release more non free binary blobs have been removed

7393036 i dont think it is me who did anything wrong they should have been investigating adrian
7393037 i was the race leader and he was lapped so he should have given way to me anyway
7393038 there was nothing for him to gain because he would let me go by on the track so it was unnecessary in the pit lane
7393039 i knew nothing about this incident and it is not right so i dont want to be getting involved in it
7393040 i think john mccain would be a great candidate for vice president i mean it i know john doesnt like me saying it but the truth of the matter is it is
7393041 i think that this is time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like they do get along
7393042 john kerry is a close friend of mine we have been friends for years
7393043 but i will not i categorically will not do it
7393044 what we want now is a comprehensive things to do from the icc so that we could implement those measures in the next home series against india
7393045 when suicide bombings happen in pakistan of course those who live thousands miles away from our country have fears
7393046 we even told these four countries to send their representatives and have their own security assessment
7393047 not only us but india had also decided to boycott
7393048 i believe in natural gas as a clean cheap alternative to fossil fuels

7393054 a growing number of companies are finding that lower visibility web oriented architecture woa developments spawned through grassroots movements are a better route to the service oriented architecture woa like soa is an architectural approach to system design though woa is resource oriented rather than service oriented whats the difference while the core soa design unit is a reusable service that fulfills a distinct business function resource oriented services are more limited and data focused
7393055 by going the woa plus rest route instead of soa plus soap the requirements for extending the application dropped considerably

7393062 was a more or less routine act of manslaughter if such a thing is said to exist
7393063 the harm to the motoring public is inherent to this offense randomly and intentionally shooting at cars with a rifle from a highway overpass creates a public fear beyond that of the ordinary manslaughter in which the victim is at least associated with creating the sudden heat that results in the death

7393230 1 when jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people he entered capernaum
7393231 this man deserves to have you do this 5 because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue
7393232 lord dont trouble yourself for i do not deserve to have you come under my roof 7 that is why i did not even consider myself worthy to come to you but say the word and my servant will be healed 8 for i myself am a man under authority with soldiers under me i tell this one go and he goes and that one come and he comes i say to my servant do this and he does it
7393233 i tell you i have not found such great faith even in israel
7393234 if this man were a prophet he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is that she is a sinner
7393235 two men owed money to a certain moneylender one owed him five hundred denarii d and the other fifty 42 neither of them had the money to pay him back so he canceled the debts of both now which of them will love him more
7393236 i suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled
7393237 do you see this woman i came into your house you did not give me any water for my feet but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair 45 you did not give me a kiss but this woman from the time i entered has not stopped kissing my feet 46 you did not put oil on my head but she has poured perfume on my feet 47 therefore i tell you her many sins have been forgiven for she loved much but he who has been forgiven little loves little
7393238 he went into the pharisees house and reclined at the table
7393239 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only he who does the will of my father who is in heaven
7393240 therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock 25 the rain came down the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house yet it did not fall because it had its foundation on the rock 26 but everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand 27 the rain came down the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house and it fell with a great crash
7393241 the kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son
7393242 the kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son
7393243 then he sent some more servants and said tell those who have been invited that i have prepared my dinner my oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered and everything is ready come to the wedding banquet
7393244 but they paid no attention and went off one to his field another to his business
7393245 then he said to his servants the wedding banquet is ready but those i invited did not deserve to come
7393246 but when the king came in to see the guests he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes
7393247 then the king told the attendants tie him hand and foot and throw him outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
7393248 zacchaeus come down immediately i must stay at your house today
7393249 he has gone to be the guest of a sinner
7393250 look lord here and now i give half of my possessions to the poor and if i have cheated anybody out of anything i will pay back four times the amount
7393251 today salvation has come to this house because this man too is a son of abraham 10 for the son of man came to seek and to save what was lost
7393252 so he came down at once and welcomed him gladly
7393253 jesus has gone to be a guest of a sinner
7393254 i tell you the truth if you have faith and do not doubt not only can you do what was done to the fig tree but also you can say to this mountain go throw yourself into the sea and it will be done 22 if you believe you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer
7393255 1 after this jesus traveled about from one town and village to another proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of god the twelve were with him 2 and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases mary called magdalene from whom seven demons had come out 3 joanna the wife of cuza the manager of herods household susanna and many others these women were helping to support them out of their own means
7393256 and jesus came and spoke unto them saying all the power is given unto me in heaven and in earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to obey all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen
7393257 ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you 8 for everyone who asks receives he who seeks finds and to him who knocks the door will be opened
7393258 which of you if his son asks for bread will give him a stone
7393259 until now you have not asked for anything in my name
7393260 when you fast do not look somber as the hypocrites do for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting i tell you the truth they have received their reward in full
7393261 and i set my face unto the lord god to seek by prayer and supplications
7393262 and jesus said unto them can the children of the bride chamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and then shall they fast
7393263 four days ago i was in my house praying at this hour at three in the afternoon suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me 31 and said cornelius god has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor 32 send to joppa for simon who is called peter he is a guest in the home of simon the tanner who lives by the sea 33 so i sent for you immediately and it was good of you to come now we are all here in the presence of god to listen to everything the lord has commanded you to tell us
7393264 i now realize how true it is that god does not show favoritism 35 but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right
7393265 when you fast do not look somber as the hypocrites do for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting i tell you the truth they have received their reward in full
7393266 do not judge or you too will be judged 2 for in the same way you judge others you will be judged and with the measure you use it will be measured to you
7393267 why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye
7393268 i did not come into the world to condemn it for it is already condemned i came to save it
7393269 9 i am the gate whoever enters through me will be saved he will come in and go out and find pasture 10 the thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy i have come that they may have life and have it to the full
7393270 4 you know the way to the place where i am going
7393271 lord we dont know where you are going so how can we know the way
7393272 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
7393273 you nullify the word of god by your tradition that you have handed down
7393274 1 if a man marries a woman who becomes displeasing to him because he finds something indecent about her and he writes her a certificate of divorce gives it to her and sends her from his house 2 and if after she leaves his house she becomes the wife of another man 3 and her second husband dislikes her and writes her a certificate of divorce gives it to her and sends her from his house or if he dies 4 then her first husband who divorced her is not allowed to marry her again after she has been defiled that would be detestable in the eyes of the lord do not bring sin upon the land the lord your god is giving you as an inheritance
7393275 do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal
7393276 the eye is the lamp of the body if your eyes are good your whole body will be full of light 23 but if your eyes are bad your whole body will be full of darkness if then the light within you is darkness how great is that darkness
7393277 no one can serve two masters either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve both god and money
7393278 do not be concerned with the things of this world be concerned with things pertaining to the kingdom of heaven
7393279 the eye is the lamp of the body if your eyes are good your whole body will be full of light
7393280 if the eye of you is sound then the whole body of you is light
7393281 but if the eye of you is evil then your whole body is dark and if your whole body be dark the darkness will be great
7393282 again you have heard that it was said to the people long ago do not break your oath but keep the oaths you have made to the lord 34 but i tell you do not swear at all either by heaven for it is gods throne 35 or by the earth for it is his footstool or by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king 36 and do not swear by your head for you cannot make even one hair white or black 37 simply let your yes be yes and your no no anything beyond this comes from the evil one
7393283 again you have heard that it was said to the people long ago do not break your oath but keep the oaths you have made to the lord but i say to you
7393284 lord we dont know where you are going so how can we know the way
7393285 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me 7 if you really knew me you would know my father as well from now on you do know him and have seen him
7393286 be careful not to do your acts of righteousness before men to be seen by them if you do you will have no reward from your father in heaven
7393287 so when you give to the needy do not announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be honored by men i tell you the truth they have received their reward in full 3 but when you give to the needy do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing 4 so that your giving may be in secret then your father who sees what is done in secret will reward you
7393288 be careful not to do your acts of righteousness before men to be seen by them if you do you will have no reward from your father in heaven
7393289 so when you give to the needy do not announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be honored by men i tell you the truth they have received their reward in full
7393290 woe to you teachers of the law and pharisees you hypocrites
7393291 do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets i have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them
7393292 i have not come to abolish them the law amp prophets but to fulfill them
7393293 21 you have heard that it was said to the people long ago do not murder and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment
7393294 therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you 24 leave your gift there in front of the altar first go and be reconciled to your brother then come and offer your gift
7393295 always be prepared to give an answer to our faith
7393296 you have heard that it was said do not commit adultery 28 but i tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart 29 if your right eye causes you to sin gouge it out and throw it away it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell 30 and if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell
7393297 what if we are only together when other people are around
7393298 what if the church is going somewhere can we sit by each other

7393300 you are the light of the world a city on a hill cannot be hidden 15 neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl instead they put it on its stand and it gives light to everyone in the house 16 in the same way let your light shine before men that they may see your good deeds and praise your father in heaven
7393301 1 now when he saw the crowds he went up on a mountainside and sat down his disciples came to him 2 and he began to teach them saying
7393302 blessed are you when people insult you persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me 12 rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you
7393303 you are the salt of the earth but if the salt loses its saltiness how can it be made salty again it is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled by men
7393304 you are the light of the world a city on a hill cannot be hidden 15 neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl instead they put it on its stand and it gives light to everyone in the house 16 in the same way let your light shine before men that they may see your good deeds and praise your father in heaven

7393308 i never expected to see your face again and now god has allowed me to see your children too
7393309 is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason
7393310 that at the beginning the creator made them male and female 5 and said for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh 6 so they are no longer two but one therefore what god has joined together let man not separate
7393311 did moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away
7393312 moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard but it was not this way from the beginning 9 i tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for marital unfaithfulness and marries another woman commits adultery
7393313 if this is the situation between a husband and wife it is better not to marry
7393314 not everyone can accept this word but only those to whom it has been given you must be given this spiritual gift 12 for some are eunuchs because they were born that way others were made that way by men and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven the one who can accept this should accept it
7393315 is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason
7393316 and if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck
7393317 salt is good but if it loses its saltiness how can you make it salty again have salt in yourselves and be at peace with each other
7393318 and if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck
7393319 if anyone wants to be first he must be the very last and the servant of all
7393320 whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me
7393321 we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop because he was not one of us
7393322 no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me 40 for whoever is not against us is for us 41 i tell you the truth anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to christ will certainly not lose his reward
7393323 if anyone wants to be first he must be last and a servant to all
7393324 from whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes from their own sons or from others
7393325 but so that we may not offend them go to the lake and throw out your line take the first fish you catch open its mouth and you will find a four drachma coin take it and give it to them for my tax and yours
7393326 when you take a census of the israelites to count them each one must pay the lord a ransom for his life at the time he is counted then no plague will come on them when you number them 13 each one who crosses over to those already counted is to give a half shekel according to the sanctuary shekel which weighs twenty gerahs this half shekel is an offering to the lord 14 all who cross over those twenty years old or more are to give an offering to the lord 15 the rich are not to give more than a half shekel and the poor are not to give less when you make the offering to the lord to atone for your lives 16 receive the atonement money from the israelites and use it for the service of the tent of meeting it will be a memorial for the israelites before the lord making atonement for your lives

7393330 you are worried and upset about many things 42 but only one thing is needed mary has chosen what is better and it will not be taken away from her
7393331 they would not listen to the voice of their father
7393332 the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the lord
7393333 the men treated the offering of the lord with contempt
7393334 this is my son in whom i am well pleased listen to him
7393335 14 when they came to the crowd a man approached jesus and knelt before him
7393336 he has seizures and is suffering greatly he often falls into the fire or into the water 16 i brought him to your disciples but they could not heal him

7393341 lord it is good for us to be here if you wish i will put up three shelters one for you one for moses and one for elijah
7393342 this is my son whom i love with him i am well pleased listen to him
7393343 some say john the baptist others say elijah and still others jeremiah or one of the prophets
7393344 you are the christ the son of the living god
7393345 blessed are you simon son of jonah for this was not revealed to you by man but by my father in heaven 18 and i tell you that you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades will not overcome it 19 i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
7393346 john the baptist has been raised from the dead and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him
7393347 he is a prophet like one of the prophets of long ago
7393348 john the man i beheaded has been raised from the dead
7393349 if anyone would follow me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me 25 for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me will find it
7393350 7 calling the twelve to him he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits
7393351 take nothing for the journey except a staff no bread no bag no money in your belts 9 wear sandals but not an extra tunic 10 whenever you enter a house stay there until you leave that town 11 and if any place will not welcome you or listen to you shake the dust off your feet when you leave as a testimony against them
7393352 3 this is good and pleases god our savior 4 who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth 5 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
7393353 all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me 19 therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit 20 and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you and surely i am with you always to the very end of the age
7393354 whats this wisdom that has been given him that he even does miracles 3 isnt this the carpenter isnt this marys son and the brother of james joseph judas and simon arent his sisters here with us
7393355 only in his hometown among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor
7393356 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
7393357 consequently just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men 19 for just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous
7393358 this is good and pleases god our savior 4 who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth 5 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
7393359 how then can they call on the one they have not believed in
7393360 how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news
7393361 get behind me satan you are a stumbling block to me you do not have in mind the things of god but the things of men
7393362 if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me 25 for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me will find it 26 what good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world yet forfeits his soul or what can a man give in exchange for his soul 27 for the son of man is going to come in his fathers glory with his angels and then he will reward each person according to what he has done 28 i tell you the truth some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
7393363 destroy this temple and i will raise it again in three days
7393364 13 when jesus heard what had happened he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place hearing of this the crowds followed him on foot from the towns 14 when jesus landed and saw a large crowd he had compassion on them and healed their sick
7393365 this is a remote place and its already getting late send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food
7393366 they do not need to go away you give them something to eat
7393367 we have here only five loaves of bread and two fish
7393368 you have heard that it was said eye for eye and tooth for tooth
7393369 know that a man is not justified grk dik ah yo o innocent by observing the law
7393370 believe in the lord jesus and you will be saved
7393371 be committed to the lord jesus and you will be saved
7393372 and when you pray do not be like the hypocrites for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men i tell you the truth they have received their reward in full 6 but when you pray go into your room close the door and pray to your father who is unseen then your father who sees what is done in secret will reward you 7 and when you pray do not keep on babbling like pagans for they think they will be heard because of their many words 8 do not be like them for your father knows what you need before you ask him
7393373 you have heard that it was said love your neighbor and hate your enemy
7393374 believe in the lord jesus and you will be saved
7393375 be committed to the lord jesus and you will be saved
7393376 for the son of man came to seek and to save what was lost
7393377 rejoice in the lord alway and again i say rejoice v 5 let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand v 6 be careful for nothing but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god v 7 and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus v 8 finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things v 9 those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you
7393378 then he took a loaf of bread and when he had thanked god for it he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples saying this is my body given for you do this in remembrance of me
7393379 for the rest brethren whatever is true whatever is worthy of reverence and is honorable and seemly whatever is lovely and lovable whatever is kind and winsome and gracious if there is any virtue and excellence if there is anything worthy of praise think on and weigh and take account of these things fix your minds on them
7393380 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7393381 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7393382 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7393383 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7393384 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7393385 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7393386 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7393387 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7393388 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7393389 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7393390 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7393391 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7393392 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7393393 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7393394 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7393395 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7393396 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7393397 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7393398 to talk of many things of shoes and ships and sealing wax of cabbages and kings and why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings

7393402 boredom is not an end product is comparatively rather an early stage in life and art youve got to go by or past or through boredom as through a filter before the clear product emerges

7393406 the fire took place in the generator which is located in a conventional building that is separate from the reactor
7393407 all security systems of the installation operated as expected and they were not affected by the fire at this moment the reactor is stopped and stable the event did not have any impact on workers or the environment
7393408 we all agree whether we are for or against nuclear power that it should be safe and that means there can be no manipulation or covering up
7393409 giglio uses a golf ball to represent the size of earth and compares it to the size of some of the known stars
7393410 the video requires some interpretation on davids part but it really got them interested the next day they went riding again and their trail took them up the side of a nearby mountain apparently the golf ball was a much talked about topic during that trip
7393411 i am trusting in christ and i know i am going to heaven but i still sin what can i do
7393412 that they are concerned about sin praise the lord that they see gods standard as one they are not able to attain
7393413 today i am happy there is no other road it is like romans 5 2 says jesus himself opened and made the road clear it says i see that it is true and i am happy also in part of verse 3 it says not to be happy in that only no when difficult circumstances come to us we are also to be happy i look at that it strengthens me there is no other way to stand only one jesus himself took me back he gave me a new road the road to heaven its jesus only its like that as i see it today my happiness is very great even also as i look at death there is no other road
7393414 so we expect both the number of suspected cases and the number of confirmed cases will increase as the investigation continues and samples continue to be received from provincial territorial and federal partners
7393415 we had to take the most conservative approach possible and recalled 100 per cent of the production from the entire facility
7393416 we had two products that tested positive for the outbreak strain
7393417 while these results are highly significant and indicate that the investigation is on the right path the investigation is not complete
7393418 test results on additional food samples expected next week will advance the investigation further
7393419 there are so many different sources of this particular organism
7393420 tragically our products have been linked to illness and loss of life to those people who are ill and to the families who have lost loved ones i offer my deepest and sincerest sympathies
7393421 words cannot begin to express our sadness for their pain
7393422 provide states and local governments grants to help their prisoners kick their drug addictions while they are incarcerated so that when they are released they can make a smooth transition back to society

7393433 i know him very well and i know he has been on the front lines of the fight for social and economic justice his entire time in public service
7393434 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7393435 i was sent to denver to vote for clinton i would be letting my voters down if i voted for anyone else
7393436 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7393437 elaborate upon his stated intention to reduce the number of abortions by providing alternative programs
7393438 if we create or become a mirror image of the religious right we have failed
7393439 but if we have increased the number of chairs around the table then weve succeeded
7393440 people of faith are being engaged in the convention in a new and robust way and its because of senator obamas acknowledgment that people of faith and values have an important place in american public life
7393441 now theres a genuine interest in speaking with groups and religious groups who were previously considered enemies
7393442 watch your step leaving the building folks first step is the worst
7393443 it is important to know that we are united in our determination to turning around america
7393444 and by united i mean all of us the afl cio the nea change to win 17 million members 38 million potential voters in union households
7393445 i know we can count on the nea the afl cio and change to win
7393446 the reality is that this is going to be barack obamas week
7393447 we dont have any illusions about the challenges we face in getting our message out but you cant expect people to cover you if you dont show up
7393448 there should be a balance and we want to make sure were available to tell the other side of the story
7393449 its pure insanity passion and faith in god that keeps us going
7393450 new american country outlaw bluegrass and hillbilly rock n roll
7393451 the road to the white house runs through the west
7393452 there has been a major political realignment in the rocky mountain west in the last seven to eight years
7393453 its worked its way up the ballot but has not reached the presidential level
7393454 democrats cant sell new york style massachusetts style union politics out there
7393455 they can sell a new environmentally conscious pragmatic governing style
7393456 have gone from being pretty noncompetitive 20 years ago to becoming contestable
7393457 deixa claro que este tipo de construci ns tam n se daba na parte central de europa
7393458 completely antithetical to the purpose of the license which is to make it both clear and legally binding that all recipients of the program have every right to copy modify and redistribute the code for any purpose italics added so long as they dont limit anyone elses rights by e g changing the license terms on modified versions of the work such a modification of the license would vitiate i e trivialize its purposes completely which is why we use the copyright on the license itself to prevent such modifications
7393459 appear to be starting from the axiom that smart algorithms software designs which cost a lot of work to develop by smart people are by definition intellectual property and that patents on them therefore by definition are valid im incorrect however because intellectual property only pops into existence when the law defines that a particular immaterial creation can be associated with certain exclusion rights the default situation is that creations of the mind are free for use by everyone and therefore patents are the exception to the rule default situation there is no good reason to deviate from this default situation because a plenty of innovation also happens without giving companies people access to broad 17 year exclusion rights b given the complexity of software a single patent no matter how smart you thought you were thinking it up virtually always affects an immense number of independently developed programs during the course of its lifetime c network effects the more people use a particular product technology file format the more valuable it becomes for developers and consumers so erecting artificial barriers is counterproductive for both
7393460 there is in fact not a single protection instrument which offers an as broad combination of coverage in terms of both the covered object patent claims are fairly broad as the people to whom it applies everyone even those who independently came up with the same thing as a patent
7393461 society is not required to hand out software patents i e extremely heavy handed exclusion rights to stimulate innovation in the software field
7393462 what would you do if you were in my shoes
7393463 hed work as hard as he could and harder than anybody else and that would either see it through or not he put his whole campaign on his shoulder
7393464 it was a streak of good fortune that he ran out of money and went up there and was himself thats what people love that he is himself not some sort of synthetic character trying to figure out who he is
7393465 the middle seat on southwest gave me a lot more opportunity to interact with voters
7393466 im not complaining still have town hall meetings still able to do 95 percent of what i did before
7393467 i think to some degree ive become a shorthand or a symbol or a stand in for now
7393468 its a spirit that says we are looking for different
7393469 the reality is that this is going to be barack obamas week
7393470 we dont have any illusions about the challenges we face in getting our message out but you cant expect people to cover you if you dont show up
7393471 there should be a balance and we want to make sure were available to tell the other side of the story
7393472 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7393473 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7393474 utterly vapid devoid of context frequently wrong and wedded to narratives that defy all logic and reality
7393475 liberals believe that they cant get a fair shake from the media anymore
7393476 thats an exact mirror of what the right did with talk radio
7393477 corrupted by their need to be part of the establishment
7393478 one of the hallmarks of netroots culture was a complete disconnect from history meaning basically anything that had happened before 1998
7393479 so burning was the netroots contempt for washington insiders and the mainstream media that they were moved to dismiss not just the individuals who fell into these categories but all the knowledge such people had accumulated
7393480 the disdain for the media is a central tenant of the philosophy its one of the boxes to check
7393481 netroots look upon this great right wing apparatus with unconcealed envy
7393482 since when does anyone besides toolbag republicans consider the media to be liberal
7393483 i think weve reached a point where by volume theres far more on the left
7393484 become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
7393485 i used to get a lot more on the right
7393486 were born too late because they would have been great communists
7393487 because were just better at it than we were four years ago
7393488 the people on the left no longer see the media as a third party intermediary
7393489 they just see it as part of the you go after media figures as if theyre part of the opposition campaign its how they need to be treated
7393490 certainly taken my share of hits from the left on
7393491 i find that intemperance is intemperance from whichever direction its coming
7393492 the methods used are always the same quotes taken out of context or chopped apart with ellipses etc but i do find the broad brush dismissal of the mainstream media very frustrating especially at this moment when were staggering toward the boneyard
7393493 even on mydd which is a liberal blog every time i criticize obama i get a huge amount of slack from his supporters
7393494 elaborate upon his stated intention to reduce the number of abortions by providing alternative programs
7393495 if we create or become a mirror image of the religious right we have failed
7393496 but if we have increased the number of chairs around the table then weve succeeded
7393497 people of faith are being engaged in the convention in a new and robust way and its because of senator obamas acknowledgment that people of faith and values have an important place in american public life
7393498 now theres a genuine interest in speaking with groups and religious groups who were previously considered enemies
7393499 it is important to know that we are united in our determination to turning around america
7393500 and by united i mean all of us the afl cio the nea change to win 17 million members 38 million potential voters in union households
7393501 i know we can count on the nea the afl cio and change to win
7393502 imagine what would happen at the instant that video fades to black the lights in the hall come up and who is standing there but ted himself the living heart and soul of this party
7393503 even if he didnt say a word the place would go absolutely nuts
7393504 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding he wrote in an excerpt which appeared in britains
7393505 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7393506 and through trial and error i finally settled on type of spit for the task at hand
7393507 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7393508 for the first time as i dived to gather the ball at square leg i landed on my side and a shower of murray mints spewed out of my trouser pocket all over the grass right in front of the umpire he wrote
7393509 fortunately neither he nor the two batsmen seemed to take much notice as i scrambled around on all fours trying desperately to gather in the sweets before they started asking awkward questions
7393510 im not surprised the harper government is doing this because i think theyre very embarrassed the economy is softening and they have nothing to propose to canadians
7393511 i think its a charade harpers up to no good here
7393512 parliament is working parliament is not dysfunctional this is an invention by mr harper to trigger and election
7393513 the person who is now speaking is not only not
7393514 i didnt even know the dnc was in town i dont watch the news
7393515 if i had known i would have done things differently it was a simple mistake

7393531 why dont you be a big girl like your size g
7393532 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7393533 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care we had to figure out you know how to start a college fund for their kids
7393534 has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7393535 we went to war and millions of people have died based on falsities
7393536 democrats voted for fisa democrats keep voting to fund the war and we want the leaders of the democratic party to take a stand for peace and justice not just here but all around the world
7393537 democrats gathering here are more optimistic about their partys chances in the general election than they have been from some time
7393538 still theres an undertow of worry about just how unified the party is in the wake of a bruising primary fight how enthusiastically clinton and more importantly her supporters embrace the soon to be nominee will be perhaps the most closely watched dynamic in denver
7393539 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7393540 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
7393541 the genesis for this was chucks real feeling that this was an unfair position

7393544 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness the education equality project is a practical plan for delivering change and restoring hope for children and parents who need a lot of both and if senator obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
7393545 alzheimers disease will bankrupt the health care system as we know it right now without a therapy
7393546 and the earlier you can get in to treat the better but how do you know before there are symptoms
7393547 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7393548 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7393549 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7393550 i surprised myself because of giving up a slider for a home run
7393551 we got struggle time we got outstanding time just one day one game tomorrow were going to come back and win
7393552 the bullpen has pitched awfully well now we can use sampson along with hawkins in the late innings
7393553 terrific win team effort everybody contributed we played them all and they all contributed
7393554 all our extra men played and lots of them helped out
7393555 weve played good baseball we just havent got the offense on track in the last couple of days theyve done a good job against us
7393556 their pen shut us down and we kind of gave it up in our pen

7393561 the number of hospitalizations for liver related diagnoses in bronx area hospitals has increased substantially magnifying the importance of having an easily accessible local liver transplant center in the bronx

7393566 were not going to see a rebound in housing anytime soon consumers are living hand to mouth and the outlook for spending is very weak
7393567 the bottom line is were losing a decade of growth in domestic aviation
7393568 the act renders this executive branch agency unaccountable and divorced from presidential control to a degree not previously countenanced in our constitutional structure
7393569 when you do shop at the grocery store its very limited they dont have a very wide selection
7393570 i think if we had a farmers market i think we would shop more and eat more produce
7393571 were already outpacing 2007 so i think were going to see significant growth
7393572 im not afraid of them especially as i know that im doing the right thing and i dont see them as my enemies
7393573 if they want to kill me let them do it my souls going to be free of my body not flesh any more
7393574 i hope that it reopens because i think its important to have that presence in harlem
7393575 it would mean a lot to a lot of people
7393576 i do think the activity in new york is probably not matched by what peoples expectations had been
7393577 you dont want voters to think that now that the primary is over youre taking them for granted
7393578 spending time in new york for either of these two candidates is as effective as buying an igloo and putting it in florida
7393579 theyre appropriately not spending a lot of time here except to pick up money which is the primary purpose in new york in a democratic campaign
7393580 it would be a very smart thing for the obama campaign to actually reach out and come to new york in particular with the jewish community
7393581 it could potentially have positive repercussions way beyond new york
7393582 we want to have an active presence around the state
7393583 i think theres a big difference between a 35 year old referendum from an earlier generation and something that has been approved by the voters
7393584 it would obviously change the political landscape dramatically but no candidate would be prohibited from running for an office for which they had been raising money
7393585 this is my store and i tell you what is going to happen

7393591 fears of supply disruption could push oil to 150 a barrel in a heartbeat
7393592 i think were looking at 200 a barrel oil in the next year or two
7393593 i love conoco transocean and schlumberger for the long term
7393594 but i wouldnt buy them now because every other day or so oil acts like its going to hell
7393595 depending upon the actions of congress with regard to wind solar and natural gas alternatives oil should begin a long term bear trend

7393598 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt
7393599 its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7393600 the clintons are great democrats and they will do what they have to do to rally the party
7393601 unless the security council is restored to its preeminent position as the sole source of legitimacy on the use of force we are on a dangerous path to anarchy
7393602 nobody in the senate agrees with that there is nothing to debate he is dead flat unequivocally wrong
7393603 my problem with you over the years has been youre too competent
7393604 i mean i would rather you be stupid and not very effective
7393605 i think you are an honorable man and you are extremely competent
7393606 if we withdraw in these circumstances without a fundamental change in saddams behavior i have reached the conclusion that that is even more damaging to us than if we were to go with an anemic cast of the willing to take him down
7393607 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement
7393608 not fully operational to receive such a quantity of aid or assist the ship of such size
7393609 shellys opponents when they have more stability can engage him on the issues
7393610 but most people dont even know hes running against anyone they think hell be there forever
7393611 what is chinatown if chinese people cant afford to live here
7393612 its good that silvers getting opposed and im urging people to vote against him
7393613 already the east village and the lower east side have been gentrified
7393614 i havent heard from any voter in this community that theyre just going to back whoever theyre told to
7393615 chinatown cannot lose a leader who has so well represented us who knows all the issues of concern from over the years and who has us in his heart
7393616 i would encourage voters to look at that rather than elect someone whos a rookie and still needs to learn the plays
7393617 all of the momentum that this community has achieved may be up in the air again if shellys not re elected
7393618 the chinese are very pragmatic can see that hes been around for so many years and can deliver like that
7393619 the kids may have moved out but the elderly stay here
7393620 peoples support depends very much on the relationship that theyve had with this person in the past
7393621 hes reaching out to more groups outside of the traditional spectrum
7393622 its not very large it wont affect the outcome of the general election
7393623 is he anti war im seeing a lot of slipping
7393624 good policy is good politics why the rahm emanuels the nancy pelosis the steny hoyers and the deans dont understand that is beyond me
7393625 were here to remind the democrats that they dont get a free ride
7393626 change i can believe in is change i can see
7393627 we want barack obama to know that if hes elected were going to keep pressuring him
7393628 dont go to war with iran what laws have they broken
7393629 we are trying to make trouble in the middle east youre going to turn the people against us
7393630 if you give someone a large container theyre going to fill it up
7393631 the average person who is going to a salad bar is overeating
7393632 the bottom line is two thirds of the people in the united states are above what they should weigh foods like this contribute to that
7393633 its a self serve bar you take as much or as little as you want
7393634 we give our shoppers the choice we provide them with foods that are healthful foods that adhere to our stringent quality standards
7393635 they can be used for one person or multiple people
7393636 people should still control their serving sizes to maintain a healthy diet
7393637 i think you have to read between the lines and go beyond the title of the dish
7393638 youre going to tend to fill up a huge plate or container
7393639 its just amazing people will think sweet potatoes are good for me yeah but youve got to watch your portions

7393643 it is almost impossible for me or my colleagues to continue to practice obstetrics i tried to stop practicing at age 55 to spend more time with family but my group could not recruit a single obstetrician and my partners would have had to work every other night in the hospital my group is still trying to recruit no luck not one decent candidate there are really no obstetricians for hire also high medical liability rates make it almost impossible for me to give care to the underserved

7393649 with the citys current financial restraints i didnt feel it necessary to spend the money when other studies are sufficient
7393650 i dont think the study was entirely necessary but i think we should go ahead with the project
7393651 with the economy the way it is its driving up the price of steel and related products at a greater rate than ever before
7393652 there are three companies that make them detroit diesel cummins and caterpillar
7393653 both caterpillar and detroit diesel have decided to get out of the business
7393654 they already went through the process we are taking advantage of that

7393660 we were enforcing the security zone around the race and i noticed the water going everywhere
7393661 the other 25 foot boat crew was already at the wreck with two coast guardsmen in the water trying to do what they could to get the people out one of the race helicopters dropped a diver who was able to get the emergency hatch open and pull the victims out
7393662 we had a high speed racing accident you attribute these things to speed
7393663 we watched and all of a sudden a police boat or something comes running onto the dock with obviously a patient on board
7393664 i think its a good experience for freshmen to get a look at the diversity
7393665 its pretty cool to start it off like this a nice tradition for the university
7393666 i think its a great way to gather all the freshmen to reinforce family and community
7393667 who are waking up to the reality that this is going to be a real dogfight

7393671 its summer still so i knew i wanted to wear a sundress
7393672 but i chose a long one because in case it gets cold at least my legs will be covered

7393674 it puts everything in perspective that new york is the center of the universe

7393680 the government will be left with no option but to return the 400 acres to the unwilling farmers we will continue to agitate till our demand is met
7393681 giving away 400 acres means giving up the entire project which is not possible we want another round of discussion with the opposition party during which some solution can come up
7393682 forceful acquisition of land is unconstitutional we will fight against this and win
7393683 we will do peaceful agitation till our demand is met
7393684 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an

7393689 any artiste mimicking a real life personality is an insult to the person all that i did was to observe achuthanandan and his mannerism and i have just used his certain mannerism
7393690 i have certain principles in life and hence i do not insult people i watched closely the way achuthanandan conducts his press conference and makes political speeches all that i did was to polish the mannerism of achuthanandan believe me i am really happy that i have done a good role
7393691 even though i do not know him personally i know him since i was a kid achuthanandan is one politician who has really come up from the lowest strata of the society and i do respect him

7393695 we have just completed a company transforming year the company said in a statement
7393696 the reported net profit includes significant items of 35 million comprising amortisation of intangibles on acquisition integration and one off acquisition costs and impairment charges
7393697 global health it provider and the company had prepared a strong platform for growth
7393698 we have an international footprint of over 13 000 customers providing substantial recurring revenues and a base primed for the release of our products mr cohen said
7393699 full year 2009 will see the global launch of our unique platform lorenzo delivering a service oriented health care platform to our existing customers
7393700 the key relationships with national health service in the united kingdom and the irish health service executive have been enhanced at the strategic and operational levels and additional contracted revenues secured mr cohen said
7393701 long term contract renewals have also been achieved in europe while in australia and south east asia iba has continued to be successful in winning new business in the state acute hospitals sector and with significant corporate players in the primary care sector

7393703 we are investing and implementing changed to our website one example is the renovation site has a new look and feel and new types of products are being sold in that market
7393704 were not only talking about residential agents but also commercial agents and agents who have holiday rentals
7393705 we always have a list of acquisition targets our lists usually has 10 to 15 entries and we want to continue what weve done in the past
7393706 this forecast has been buoyed by the anticipated synergies from the mackay permanent acquisition but at the same time has been tempered with caution in lending operations and wholesale funding costs
7393707 we will monitor the market over coming months for the opportunity to further recoup these additional costs on wholesale funding

7393710 warts and all securities lending review has glossed over one large ugly carbuncle the bank may yet bail out the stock lender and broker tricom
7393711 ring fencing tricoms 81 million loan book and now anz is once again exposed to the losses
7393712 we are continuing to support our customer was all the bank would say this morning
7393713 no comment was the official line when asked if anz would stump up cash to bail out tricom anz already owns 11 5 of tricom as does babcock amp brown after the two struck a band aid rescue deal this year
7393714 new broom at anz ceo mike smith can hardly blame his predecessor john macfarlane any more
7393715 the gravity of the issues relating to the equity finance business should have been but was not properly brought to the attention of the chief executive of the board smacks of buck passing of the highest order
7393716 ring fencing of the loan book and the general state of financial markets this means there is no agreement on who has liability for the debts in the loan book
7393717 we have issues and we are trying to deal with them he said yesterday
7393718 we are still working on achieving our mutual objectives whatever hurdles are there we will try to get over them
7393719 to tell you the truth we didnt expect rand uridashis to keep their popularity for this long said hiroshi kannoo the manager of foreign fixed income assets at rakuten securities which sells uridashis through its website
7393720 many uridashi investors dont give it a second glance if the coupon is below 10 said tsutomu soma senior manager of foreign assets at okasan securities
7393721 uridashis in rand and other exotic currencies keep coming due to retail investors quest for higher yields and novel products said tohru sasaki chief foreign exchange strategist at jpmorgan chase bank in tokyo
7393722 that trend is supported by a structural issue here and is expected to stay mr sasaki said
7393723 we distributed turkish lira bonds for the first time in march the sale went surprisingly well said rakutens mr kannoo
7393724 rouble bonds are also popular despite their coupons that are about half the lira bonds he said
7393725 much of this margin growth is due to our exposure to the downstream electricity market through our throughput ownership of the daandine and townsville power stations where prices have been very strong
7393726 well its kind of strange because when we shot the final season we didnt know it would be the end they canceled the series after we finished shooting so there is no tie up to it
7393727 if i had got my doctorate i wouldnt have become a writer had i continued i would probably be studying something like passivity and activity in the language of jane austen in fact in my next book what would jane do thats what the heroine will be studying i am living vicariously through her
7393728 the icc board agreed unanimously to postpone the icc champions trophy scheduled to take place in pakistan next month until october 2009
7393729 pakistan will retain the right to host the tournament but it was agreed that if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the icc board would have the right to decide about the tournaments location
7393730 there was complete support and sympathy for pakistan and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7393731 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7393732 every one of our members wishes to ensure the champions trophy is a world class event and the prospect of relocating it at short notice in order to make sure it was played this year would not allow that criterion to be fulfilled
7393733 sundays agreement provides clarity for our members and in september we will look to put in place a timeframe for arrangements ahead of the event taking place in 2009
7393734 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7393735 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7393736 we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year
7393737 we are thankful to the icc for their support and to india who backed us in all these matters
7393738 the parties will consider the feasibility of the chemical facility supplying the majority of arafuras chemical needs for its rare earth facility including hydrochloric and sulphuric acid and caustic soda
7393739 another record year in financial 2009 and was well positioned to build on the firm base it had created
7393740 much of this margin growth is due to our exposure to the downstream electricity market through our throughput ownership of the daandine and townsville power stations where prices have been very strong mr davies said a corker too dear to drink
7393741 were also seeing the resources sector holding up despite a mixed bag of metal prices overnight
7393742 at this stage the market looks like it may remain relatively well bid by the end of the day but it wouldnt surprise me if we did see some profit taking later on
7393743 the group consultation with its lenders has concluded that no proposal received to date provides acceptable outcome which is in the best interests of all relevant stakeholders
7393744 the group believes that in particular given current difficult capital market conditions an acceptable proposal capable of being implemented by 15 december 2008 is unlikely to be forthcoming
7393745 in the absence of a recapitalisation solution in the short term the groups objective therefore is to obtain longer term debt extensions from the lender groups beyond 15 december 2008 to provide a more stabilised environment for the recapitalisation process to be pursued over a longer time frame
7393746 the group has commenced discussions with the lender groups on possible terms for longer term debt extension and stabilisation of the group
7393747 it is likely that those terms would include a requirement for the conversion of a portion of debt into some form of hybrid security
7393748 this may impact the value of the groups existing ordinary equity

7393755 i have never seen a stranger yet more majestic looking creature
7393756 last year we went to seaworld san diego and saw michaels female counterpart michelle and even though the show was a little funnier than this one nothing compares to watching michael almost hover over the water after launching his trainer into the air
7393757 i liked it when he played dead and floated in the water
7393758 when he was placed back into his tank the slightly loose portion of his black swim cap immediately folded over to the right side a telltale symptom of stress and angst and you can be certain that just before he left for beijing he didnt bite that little girls arm off because he was happy
7393759 the increasing availability of single serve and multi packs may not serve consumers in the long run but because they are considered to be innocent pleasures may turn out to be sneaky small sins
7393760 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an
7393761 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women
7393762 on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
7393763 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood

7393769 we probably havent put a full game together which weve been really happy with
7393770 but its definitely three quarters or half a game that are how we like to play our football and i think weve been putting some good scores on the board and also stopping the opposition
7393771 so if we can do that for four quarters we can give ourselves every chance of being successful
7393772 we were in no position to take any week for granted
7393773 you look back 10 weeks we were scraping to get into the top eight and thats pretty much been our focus just to improve as a side and we got across the line
7393774 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
7393775 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
7393776 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
7393777 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
7393778 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
7393779 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
7393780 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
7393781 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
7393782 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
7393783 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
7393784 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
7393785 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
7393786 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
7393787 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
7393788 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
7393789 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

7393798 theyve got an australian coach there in jamie siddons so theyll know us pretty well

7393800 this is an act which stands in absolute violation of islamic as well as local pakhtun traditions
7393801 it is only a matter of time before wolves spread all across northern germany in their move ever westward
7393802 aside from two large cities berlin and hamburg the region is sparsely settled
7393803 weasels and otters and raccoons are already well re establishing themselves
7393804 and the european moose elk is poised to move westward
7393805 wolves are certainly welcome here as they enrich the local wildlife assortment
7393806 of course if they become a pest hunters will have to go after them to keep their population number in check as we do with red foxes
7393807 they decimate not only mice but also other small mammals and snakes and other egg thieves
7393808 we actually get appeals from residents to kill more foxes
7393809 because they are eliminating too many predators in some nature wildlife preserves
7393810 this is the region where we shall see whether the wolf spreads further westward and if so in what numbers
7393811 the main problem will be the clich of the big bad wolf in the minds of many people wolves can of course be dangerous to humans in certain situations generally when they are backed into a corner but they are generally no threat to humans
7393812 europeans generally are very mindful of the dire effects that humans have had on the environment over the centuries and they are for the most part happy to see the return of bears and wolves and other creatures after near extinction of those species
7393813 as more predators move in the balance of nature returns to normal and we see a reduction in rats and mice and rabbits
7393814 those small creatures form the diet of predators such as the german sea eagle which was the emblem of germany for centuries but which was driven to the verge of extinction by unthinking hunters
7393815 we want to know whether men who report satisfaction with their penis size may have higher self esteem and better body image than men who are dissatisfied with the size of their penis
7393816 if men believe that a large penis size is the cultural ideal then this could affect how they perceive their general physical attractiveness
7393817 given that first impressions during dating situations are largely dependent on physical attractiveness individuals with low physical self esteem may find it easier to use the internet for dating and socializing purposes
7393818 i dont think that humans were the main agent because theres evidence of co existence between humans and megafauna over long periods of time which knocks flannerys blitzkrieg theory on the head
7393819 the tasmanian results echo those on mainland australia putting humans squarely back in the frame as the driving force behind the megafaunal extinction
7393820 argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined
7393821 its sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
7393822 they have this article of faith now that humans arrived swept across the continent and wiped out the megafauna
7393823 they have got one species from a cave where theres no evidence of people and suddenly its human causation
7393824 thirty three per cent of acute aortic dissection patients die within the first 24 hours if they remain untreated because the disease is not diagnosed
7393825 we did our study primarily to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying acute aortic dissection
7393826 the study was also aimed at the future development of a clinical test for monitoring patients with a high risk of acute aortic dissection most acute aortic dissection patients do not have a known connective tissue disorder the identification of the four genes could be a starting point to develop a diagnostic tool
7393827 parents should discuss their anxieties and inform themselves thoroughly about eating disorders among teenagers
7393828 if one of the parents suffers from depression their child is four times more likely to suffer from a mental illness at a young age or as a teenager
7393829 moral responsibility to do the right thing and the right thing we would expect in most cases will be to look at returning them to their rightful families
7393830 the world has to learn to live with a change of geopolitical nature
7393831 can you really know someone without ever having met them thousands of people perhaps millions might say yes but is there really a simple clearcut straight foward answer no if there were i wouldnt be wondering about this but still i ask is it possible to know and yes even fall in love with someone that youve never laid eyes on i believe it is possible in fact i think its a great way to fall in love that way you know that you are falling in love with the person and not his or her looks however then the question arises if the person is truly who they say they are but thats another issue for another time some people will say that part of knowing a person is being in their physical presence seeing their gestures facial expressions posture etc and theyre right but whos to say that you cant fall in love first and then meet while there is no substitute for in person interactions no potential for truly knowing someone without such presence it is possible of course this doesnt stop people from trying hoping and believing certainly millions of normal individuals seek and often find people to interact with via the internet but to know their soul their deepest selves you have to be able to look into their eyes and that cannot be done without personal interaction each case is different and what works for one does not always work for another
7393832 we have found in recent sample groups that women prefer men that have alot of trophies on their playstation 3 a large collection of playstation trophies usually implies that the man not only has a large penis but is also rich further studies also have revealed that women only find men that have high xbox live gamer scores to be slightly attractive with further findings that men with excessively high gamer scores are likely closeted homosexuals who are also employees of microsoft
7393833 we have recently reviewed that highly educated women believe that men with high xbox live gamerscores have even higher social status then men that attended ivy league schools

7393842 some of you may be surprised to hear that if you take your child on an overseas trip in school time this is considered an unjustified absence and therefore your children are recorded as truant

7393848 in this case i mean alcohol the consuming of alcohol in no way you know had any bearing on the ruling of joey turners accidental death
7393849 i mean each and every person including mr skipper here has indicated that he drank alcohol on that night and pardon me for getting a little perturbed but i feel like were beating a dead horse with this alcohol
7393850 its clear and apparent by lance skippers own statements that he consumed alcoholic beverages on the 4 th of july okay which is improper and statutorily illegal okay but after investigating the fact two days later theres nothing that i could do to charge him with a crime in reference to that it was after the fact okay

7393905 from time to time they will also face challenges after they are on the ballot from establishment candidates fearful of the impact third parties might have on their races if they are that worried about competition from third party candidates rather than trying to limit voters choices politicians should implement instant runoff voting which would allow voters to rank their candidates in order of preference end the spoiler problem and allow people to vote their conscience without helping to elect the major party candidate they like least

7393955 the nzpf is disappointed that the national party is taking this approach to education policy
7393956 this policy shows a lack of understanding of what is already happening in our schools
7393957 we have some of the best systems in the world and with adequate resourcing we could become number one national needs to concentrate on improving resourcing for programmes such as special needs and reading recovery
7393958 our national standards policy has been well received by school principals and teachers
7393959 there is concern at the very highest level that kate middleton still does not have a job
7393960 the queen is keen that the monarchy should lead by example and that the princes and their girlfriends should all be seen to be hard workers
7393961 the queen has made it known that she feels kate should get involved with a charity possibly an animal charity where she can be seen to be doing something proactive and something entirely safe
7393962 it is important that kate isnt seen to be doing anything controversial and she needs to do something completely different from any of the charity work that diana did

7393967 they funds will form a large part of our long term reform agenda in making sure we boost long term productivity growth
7393968 there is the clear architecture of our approach to economic reform
7393969 if i was dr nelson what i would be saying is lets get behind this its sensible for the countrys long term economic future
7393970 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7393971 its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what youve got to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is still in reasonably good shape
7393972 shes going to be an important an important voice in this campaign
7393973 but obama felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7393974 the study found the health benefits and health care cost savings related to the first phase of the ntc were far greater than previously estimated the campaign resulted in 190 000 people quitting smoking and a 1 4 drop in smoking rates and this decline has translated into an immense cost saving to the australian health care system
7393975 by using mass media campaigns to encourage people to quit smoking millions of healthcare dollars will be saved and even more importantly the burden of smoking caused disease on individual australians and their families will be eased
7393976 victorians will once again be exposed to confrontational images of fat being squeezed from the aorta of a smoker as some of the most powerful ntc messages are brought back to television in updated versions focusing on the graphic health warnings found on cigarette packs
7393977 the reworked ntc campaign provides explicit visual insight into how every cigarette is doing a smoker damage and strengthens the connection between what is going on in a smokers body with the images they might be seeing on the pack
7393978 despite smoking causing 40 of heart disease in those less than 65 years of age almost 2 out of 3 smokers cannot spontaneously identify smoking as a cause of heart disease
7393979 we hope that bringing back the ntc message most relevant to heart disease we can make quitting top of mind for the many smokers who may not have understood the deadly consequences of their habit
7393980 smoking is the largest cause of preventable death and disease in australia and it is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease but the good news is that quitting could put a smoker on the road to a healthy heart within a year

7393984 lets forget about any bank branch weve built in the past if we were designing a branch from scratch what attributes would it have and more importantly if our objective is to build the most affordable and most efficient green bank branch what would we do

7394017 most of the time if they are right in front of you you can see them pretty easily but if you turn and a pedestrian decides to step out beside the trailer might have a hard time seeing them behind the trailer as its coming around

7394063 for all the slogans of peace and harmony for all the hopes that awarding beijing the olympics would somehow lead to more openness and respect for humans rights china has failed to deliver
7394064 on the other hand many have seen too much organisation robbing the event of a lively audience the spontaneous adoption of unlikely crowd favourites and the mingling of local people with spectators from overseas
7394065 the us government encourages the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games

7394067 the beijing olympics have been a spectacular sporting event but they took place against a backdrop of human rights violations with activists prevented from expressing their views peacefully and many in detention when they have committed no crime
7394068 the chinese authorities and the ioc had an opportunity to demonstrate human rights improvements but in most respects they failed to deliver forced evictions detention of activists and restrictions on journalists should not blight another olympics

7394080 american basketball where its supposed to be on the top of the world
7394081 the fact that we had this team for three years was the telling difference in this game
7394082 it was a great game it was a pressure game from the get go and we never cracked the fact that we were together for this period of time was the difference

7394110 has made it immeasurably harder to confront and work through the many other problems in the region and it has made many of those problems considerably more dangerous
7394111 could be temporarily suspended if the iraqi government meets the security political and economic benchmarks to which it has committed but we must recognize that in the end only iraqi leaders can bring real peace and stability to their country
7394112 the best chance we have to leave iraq a better place is to pressure these warring parties the sunnis and the shiites to find a lasting political solution and the only effective way to apply this pressure is to begin a phased withdrawal of u s forces
7394113 an enormous opportunity to begin the phased redeployment of combat troops
7394114 it is increasingly clear that the bush administration will leave office with al qaeda having successfully relocated its base from afghanistan to pakistans tribal areas where it has rebuilt much of its ability to attack from the region and broadcast its messages to militants across the world

7394127 he needs a big win in a major getting to the quarters is not going to do it
7394128 he needs a victory over nadal or federer or djokovic to spark him
7394129 he is like a shooter in basketball who can get hot his big serve can serve him well and andy knows better than most that any time he walks through the gates at flushing meadows something special can happen
7394130 it wasnt an easy decision and i knew it would haunt me but with what has gone on in the last four months i thought staying home was best for me
7394131 if he goes out and wins the u s open and gains a little confidence in not coming out here and changing time zones and dealing with the pressures of the olympics he made the right decision
7394132 its safe to say its gone beyond my wildest expectations and my expectations were really high
7394133 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7394134 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7394135 i was in the laundry and standing right next to nadal
7394136 i didnt bother him but he was shoving all his colors and whites in together
7394137 i really wanted to say dude youre going to have a nightmare with that you cant just put the whole bag in there are reds in with whites but what can you do
7394138 i just tried to soak in every moment and i had the time of my life we played in four cities in china and everywhere we went the volunteers and fans went out of their way to make us feel like olympians we leave china with a special fondness in our hearts for the people of this country
7394139 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly everyone in the village is great
7394140 we could not be more proud of our athletes for everything they accomplished here in beijing both on and off the field of play
7394141 new stars were born stars from past games amazed us we shared their joy and their tears and we marveled at their ability
7394142 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7394143 we emphasize the fact that as flattering as being ranked no 1 is polls do not win games
7394144 that has to be done by the players on friday night
7394145 russia has no right to establish checkpoints in georgia the ceasefire agreement is the only agreement that is still alive all others are broken
7394146 georgia considers this as a continuation of occupation they have just changed their helmets georgia will continue to observe the ceasefire and launch international diplomatic initiatives to force russia to keep its word
7394147 we had just enough time to move away to the right before getting hit we were really lucky
7394148 a wall of ice coming towards us and we were carried 200 metres
7394149 i dont think well manage to recover the bodies because they finished up in an area of high risk in which there are highly unstable towers of ice that could easily collapse
7394150 last night it was cold it was nice so it was simply the weight of the ice which became too much
7394151 it was a big slab and that slab was big enough to reach the team of climbers
7394152 one of the worst accidents we have had for decades even when all precautions have been taken as seems to have been the case here things can go dramatically wrong
7394153 this isnt the first accident and it wont be the last
7394154 when the plane caught fire one of its doors was blocked and everyone rushed to another door
7394155 there was a stampede and many of those on board will only be able to be identified using dna analysis
7394156 the building unions are really trying to intimidate people to change the current arrangement and by lobbying politicians to bring forward the abolition of the abcc
7394157 weve had a meeting with the fire chief weve actually filled water trucks up and parked them at his house
7394158 theres not so much a bushfire risk but more for peoples safety
7394159 the great artesian basin supports life right across central and north west queensland so we have to be careful how we use that particular resource
7394160 i think the changes we will make will be management issues that people suggest to us
7394161 there hasnt been a protest in the styx or florentine valleys for 17 days in fact a few weeks
7394162 now the reason theres a protest there now is that the olympics is finished and theres some media time free for them
7394163 until we did the costings simply put mr hamilton smith hasnt done the costings its financially irresponsible not to do all the costings before such an announcement is made
7394164 were going to start work on the audit of our infrastructure now and we wont wait til march 2010 well be well prepared and if necessary well be certainly be in touch with the national committee anyway
7394165 i just want to be known as the australian diver who did really well at the olympics
7394166 its everybody else who thinks its special when homosexuality and elite sport go together
7394167 isso n o podia ser um fato casual fiquei interessada em compreender o que levou a essa defasagem desde ent o entrevistamos muitas brasileiras que participaram das olimp adas e come amos a ter resultados que nos colocam diante de quest es muito particulares do esporte feminino no pa s
7394168 as mulheres j foram privadas por lei de participar de determinadas provas como lutas ou futebol as delega es come aram a ter um n mero equilibrado de mulheres e homens apenas em sidney em 2000
7394169 com as entrevistas estamos constatando que h uma certa acomoda o das mulheres com essa situa o elas tendem a achar natural o predom nio masculino nos jogos acham que o pr mio deles deve ser maior mesmo
7394170 estamos vendo que essa hist ria no brasil tem rela o direta com a pr pria compreens o do feminismo no pa s as lutas da mulher n o s o caracterizadas como lutas pol ticas isso se reflete na postura das atletas que n o se referem a qualquer tipo de discrimina o exceto em rela o ra a
7394171 de maneira geral o que surpreende a dificuldade das mulheres em referir discrimina o que no entanto patente queremos descobrir se fazem isso por medo de repres lias ou se h um discurso de aceita o impregnado
7394172 uma das atletas chorou durante a entrevista ao se lembrar de situa es a que se viu submetida por capricho de um dirigente que destruiu seu sonho de ir aos jogos ol mpicos mas em vez de atribuir o caso ao preconceito ela acreditava que se tratava de uma rixa pessoal
7394173 podemos avaliar o mesmo momento hist rico sendo interpretado pelo repert rio de diversas trajet rias pessoais
7394174 olhando os resultados das brasileiras nessa olimp ada conquistaram seis das 15 medalhas sendo duas de ouro e uma de prata eu diria que as mulheres est o surpreendendo isso n o quer dizer que elas ter o melhores condi es para trabalhar daqui em diante seria preciso que elas fossem tratadas pelo menos com o mesmo respeito dado ao esporte masculino que ainda assim tamb m tem muitas dificuldades
7394175 o bar o de coubertin ao instituir os jogos da era moderna em 1894 proibiu a participa o feminina argumentando que na gr cia hel nica elas eram barradas por n o serem cidad s nas olimp adas de paris em 1900 com o vigor do movimento feminista ele foi obrigado a aceitar as mulheres
7394176 em olimp adas n o h milagres acontece o bvio ganham os melhores se o brasil tem poucas medalhas em rela o a determinados pa ses porque os atletas desses pa ses est o mais bem preparados erros e derrotas dram ticas acontecem com todos mas nossos atletas tiveram um desempenho coerente com a prepara o que tiveram
7394177 e n o falo apenas de investimento mas de planejamento os jogos ol mpicos de pequim acabaram neste domingo a partir de segunda feira os pa ses que mais ganharam medalhas estar o se preparando para londres em 2012 mas seguindo a pol tica do comit ol mpico brasileiro nossa prepara o come ar apenas em julho de 2011

7394185 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7394186 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7394187 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7394188 then winning in any one of the 6 of co nv va oh fla in are game set and match
7394189 among unaffiliated voters 25 are more likely to vote for obama while 33 had the opposite view
7394190 and yet only rasmussen has mccain ahead in ohio and is the only one who has had mccain ahead in months ohio is tailor made for mccain and he cant get a poll lead from anyone not named rasmussen
7394191 the undecideds will break for mccain just like they did for hillary in the primary
7394192 this latest survey might have more good news for mccain than might appear at first glance
7394193 not all toss ups are equal if this were october 26 instead of august 6 we probably wouldnt have this many toss ups states on our map florida missouri and nevada would move into the lean mccain column while michigan new mexico and pennsylvania would move into obamas that would give obama a 260 232 electoral lead over mccain and it would leave us with four pure toss ups colorado new hampshire ohio and virginia
7394194 if you ever forget ill fuck you up and give you the screaming mimis
7394195 political opponents would file frivolous complaints against web sites in order to try and shut them down
7394196 may be too closely aligned with people who hold radical political views
7394197 if youre a little bit critical of barack obama you get really a pie of vilification right in the face
7394198 were born too late because they would have been great communists
7394199 i dont want him going but i tell you what i dont want my grandsons or granddaughters going back in 15 years so how we leave makes a big difference
7394200 terrorism is a means not an end and very different groups and countries are using it toward very different goals if we cant even identify the enemy or describe the war were fighting its difficult to see how we will win
7394201 become the greatest propaganda tool that exists for recruiting of terrorists around the world
7394202 prohibit extraterritorial detention and rendition except under limited circumstances to modify the definition of unlawful enemy combatant for purposes of military commissions and to extend statutory habeas corpus to detainees
7394203 do you agree or disagree with the statement made by former attorney general gonzales in january 2007 that nothing in the constitution confers an affirmative right to habeas corpus separate from any statutory habeas rights congress might grant or take away
7394204 i disagree categorically with mr gonzales the constitution guarantees the right of habeas corpus unless in the case of rebellion or invasion it is suspended my national security with justice act reinforces this constitutional right by extending by statute meaningful habeas review for all guant namo detainees
7394205 we regret the loss of life among the innocent afghanis who we are committed to protect
7394206 it provides propaganda to the taliban and if they dont take responsibility it actually helps the taliban
7394207 the liberals control the ultimate passage of so much of this through the senate so the question of economic responsibility goes fair and squarely back to them he told abc radio today
7394208 are they going to puncture a 3 7 or 6 1 billion immediate black hole into the budget at a time of global economic uncertainty
7394209 whether its the liberal party or whether its independents in the senate or the greens the government will fight for the integrity of our budget he said
7394210 so were going to take them to the senate and then well see whos economically responsible and whos prepared to vote for certainty in economic policies
7394211 if youre going to tax people tax the gas guzzlers thats what it comes down to leader bob brown told abc radio
7394212 barring any talks in the meantime greens senator christine milne will be moving in the senate to have the government withdraw the bill and redraft it to make it climate friendly
7394213 if its a hybrid vehicle an ultra low emissions vehicle it doesnt make sense to me getting slugged in the same way as a gas guzzling maserati he told abc radio
7394214 we had the last three years with the howard government in full control ramming through its work choices industrial relations legislation the sale of telstra and so on and they lost office over it he said

7394224 the document lays out in detail a plan by telstra management to sideline unions and cut the pay of thousands of field technicians lines workers and other key staff through new job contracts the
7394225 the company aims to hold workers pay to below the rate of inflation effectively cutting its wages bill by almost 15 per cent over four years
7394226 for the average technician this would amount to a cut in real wages over time of 7 300 a year
7394227 telstra is a prime example of big employers who are behaving badly towards their staff and thumbing their nose at the rudd governments cooperative industrial relations policy mr lawrence said
7394228 we expect to see new laws introduced into the parliament very soon to scrap all of work choices and replace it with a fair and balanced industrial relations system
7394229 we have taken the extra step of talking to wholesale employees about whats important to them and that will be reflected in any proposed agreement a telstra spokesman said
7394230 of course our employees will be able to vote on any proposed agreement
7394231 for the first time many employees may have the opportunity to earn extra money through good performance

7394241 we need to get this matter resolved before the transfer deadline
7394242 that such a large amount of fish is used for the pet food industry is real eye opener dr turchini said
7394243 what is also interesting is that in australia pet cats are eating an estimated 13 7 kilograms of fish a year which far exceeds the australian average human per capita fish and seafood consumption of around 11 kilograms
7394244 our pets seem to be eating better than their owners
7394245 while much of the criticism has been on the grounds that forage fish could be better used for human consumption directly particularly amongst the poorer nations of the world rather than in the production of food for farmed fish little attention has been paid to the amount of forage fish used by the pet food industry dr turchini said
7394246 these gourmet pet foods contain a significant amount of fish that may be suitable for direct human consumption
7394247 hill rom is pleased to celebrate the opening of this important addition to our global r amp d footprint
7394248 our innovation center in singapore represents an acceleration of our efforts to embed increasingly sophisticated and differentiated micro electronics and software in our products we also see the opening of this center as an important step in globalizing our products and presence

7394250 innovation and partnering are key levers for a successful medical technology company like hill rom
7394251 thats why we saw singapore as a perfect location not only does singapore offer great technical talent but also it provides an environment with sophisticated health care institutions and a strong government supportive of growth as our r amp d center ramps up we are looking to collaborate with our asian partners to advance and test new bed technologies and business models with the intent of raising the standard of care offered to patients and caregivers worldwide
7394252 we hope that as the spotlight shines bright on denver and minneapolis st paul during the next two weeks we can show bikes as a pathway for healthy bodies healthy spirits and a healthier planet
7394253 the time is right to highlight the bicycle as an ideal transportation solution nearly 40 percent of all trips americans make are two miles or less the perfect length to go by bike with soaring gas prices interest in bicycling as a u s transportation solution has grown this is a perfect opportunity to demonstrate the convenience of bicycling for short trips
7394254 biking is fun and this innovative program from humana and bikes belong provides an excellent way for people to exercise and we all know exercise is critical to protecting ones health i encourage everyone planning to attend the conventions to strap on a helmet and safely pedal their way to good health during their stay in denver or minneapolis st paul

7394262 to account for cathers fiction by reading it as an encoding of covert even guilty sexuality is i think patronizing and narrow it assumes that the works is written only in order to express homosexual feeling in disguise it makes her out to be a coward which was certainly not one of her failings and it assumes that openness would have been preferable if the argument is that cather never dealt adequately with her homosexuality in her fiction that my ntonia is a betrayal of female independence and female sexuality and that the professors house and death comes for the archbishop retreat into a world dominated by patriarchy then cather is diminished by being enlisted to a cause she was a writer who worked at her best through indirection suppression and suggestion and through a refusal to be enlisted
7394263 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness

7394265 the affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree as buds give rise by growth to fresh buds and these if vigorous branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch so by generation i believe it has been with the great tree of life which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications
7394266 i never want to say that but its as bad as it can get as far as issues with the knee according to rod martin trainer unfortunately it will be a long process
7394267 hes had so many things like this happen to him hes had a lot of tough breaks injury wise he was on a one year contract so this was very tough for him

7394272 domestic workers should be assessed if they are able to respond be able to take this type of stress

7394302 before an employer refuses accommodation they must obtain all relevant information about the employee including his or her medical condition prognosis for recovery job capabilities and ability to do alternate work
7394303 an employer must be able to demonstrate that it is not possible to accommodate employees without undue hardship
7394304 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7394305 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7394306 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7394307 its not that theres anything wrong with the choice of joe biden a majority of those polled rate the biden selection as excellent or pretty good voters think he is qualified to be president and with the exception of al gore in 1992 the public ranks biden as the most qualified running mate in recent times
7394308 a lot of americans dont know who he is but his favorable rating is 13 points higher than his unfavorables but biden is not hillary clinton and its possible that is enough to have moved some of her supporters away from the democratic ticket at least temporarily
7394309 if some smart person comes along and puts a hole in obama
7394310 heavn has no rage like love to hatred turnd nor hell a fury like a woman scornd
7394311 if some smart person comes along and puts a hole in obama then were stuck with biden

7394350 als uitzaaiingen mijn lot zijn dan zie ik dat ter zijner tijd wel
7394351 er zijn twee opties of je gaat veel minder eten of je gaat bewegen
7394352 en haar persoonlijke ervaring was dat dat een goede reden is om voor beweging te kiezen
7394353 nee hoor je hebt niet te dikke billen blijf je dan bij mij
7394354 de loutering die de kanker met zich meebrengt kun je eigenlijk zien als groot onderhoud van de geest de olie is ververst bouten en schroeven zijn aangedraaid de computerchips zijn ge reset en er worden zuivere filters in gebracht waardoor het leven zoveel waardevoller lijkt zoveel meer inhoud heeft ik ben een gelukkig mens ik ga er alles aan doen om deze fantastische neveneffecten nooit te laten slijten

7394407 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one

7394428 id never heard about these so called honour killings until i came to the uk to study it was then that i read about cases and was shocked the more i researched it the more i wanted to do a film about it
7394429 interestingly one group that over consumes the mini packs is chronic dieters individuals constantly trying to manage their weight and food intake
7394430 on the one hand consumers perceive the mini packs to be a generous portion of food numerous small food morsels in each pack and multiple mini packs in each box on the other hand consumers perceive the mini packs to be diet food for chronic dieters this perceptual dilemma causes a tendency to overeat due to their emotion laden relationship with food
7394431 desiring to be faithful i desire to be obedient and trying to keep moving in the right direction toward gods ways
7394432 recently some special interest groups have claimed without providing any scientific rationale that some may have an abortifacient effect
7394433 no exists showing that implantation is prevented by progestin only methods
7394434 the evidence does not support the theory that the usual mechanism of action of iuds is destruction of fertilized ova in the uterus
7394435 even though the of modern contraceptive is not yet fully known scientific evidence suggests the main mechanisms of action for each method inhibition of ovulation and effects on the are the primary mechanisms of the contraceptive action of hormonal methods evidence indicates that the primary mechanism of action of iuds is the prevention of fertilization
7394436 all of these methods directly or indirectly have effects on the endometrium the lining of the uterus that might prevent implantation of a fertilized ovum
7394437 so far no scientific evidence has been published supporting this possibility
7394438 insufficient evidence exists on whether cellular or biological changes in the endometrium could actually prevent implantation
7394439 the possibility of fertilization during combined oral contraceptive use is very small hence endometrial changes are unlikely to play an important role if any in the observed contraceptive effectiveness of combined oral contraceptives
7394440 and four of these physicians followed up with a more detailed paper on hormonal contraceptives in general
7394441 currently the claim that hormonal contraceptives birth control pills implants norplant injectables depoprovera include an abortifacient is being widely disseminated in the pro life community
7394442 the presumption that implantation of a blastocyst is thwarted by
7394443 the is abortifacient theory is not established scientific fact it is speculation and the discussion presented here suggests it is error
7394444 if a family weighing all the factors affecting their own circumstances decides to use this modality we are confident that they are not using an abortifacient
7394445 handset manufacturers are under pressure to deal with electronic waste issues and show they are looking for more sustainable practices
7394446 weve seen a lot of interest in this as the wave of the future
7394447 someone with an old pick up truck with no shocks will have a glorious time with m2e technology but someone with a mercedes will have to spend more time
7394448 im gonna git you sucka was my hommage to the generation of films that i grew up on everybody had their john waynes and gary coopers thats who those guys were to me
7394449 i was able to have fun with some of the ridiculous and low budget nature of those movies it was a great experience because i got to do a lot of things in one small movie
7394450 the officer claimed gonzalez was carrying a condom and had been arrested before as a hooker
7394451 the parents kept saying they really wanted our school to teach the values of peace and struggle
7394452 and what the community had to do to fight for the school
7394453 theres a combination of self awareness and the opportunity to become socially conscious
7394454 were not dogmatic about it but we give them the opportunity for self discovery
7394455 reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it
7394456 taking kids lives as a point of departure and bringing the world into the classroom really does seem to give a context and a purpose that is very motivating
7394457 examples of lessons where you can really learn the math basics
7394458 but the purpose of learning the math actually becomes an entree into and a deeper understanding of the political ramifications of the issue
7394459 at least to expose people to a structural analysis of inequality and the distribution of goodies in society
7394460 seems to be one of the more obvious ways that we can do better than we have done
7394461 i dont see how that rapid expansion is possible without the proliferation of small schools and charter schools
7394462 they create an institutional opening and a resource base that wasnt there before
7394463 we find that there are a lot of teachers who are highly politicized but they are isolated in schools where they are being forced to implement curriculum or policies that are really antithetical to their own belief system
7394464 you have to be careful you have to build allies
7394465 but the reality is that theres always space theres always cracks
7394466 oftentimes its individuals or individual institutions doing their own work
7394467 and its one of these things where you look up and realize that there are actually a lot of different people who share similar values but havent necessarily connected with each other
7394468 people are talking about things in ways which i dont think ive heard since the 1970s and that includes education
7394469 because everyone is trying to find a way to do it right
7394470 i mean theres a balance theres a reason why people like her its because she doesnt sort of you know fuel the fire
7394471 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback
7394472 probably meant im more proud you know is what she really meant
7394473 id have to think about that id have to think about policies her approach her tone
7394474 the attention that hes focused on work family balance that is our life to the extent that we have challenges and struggles headaches that everybody else is going through those are our conversations

7394499 im completely american i was born and raised in america and i love it but i think we are too quick to censor nudity
7394500 meanwhile its okay to blow things up and our films are so violent and our television is so violent
7394501 i would rather see tasteful nudity than violence any day of the week
7394502 sometimes these doubts are cast but i would suggest some americans could look at themselves first they had cheats in 2000 marion jones and cheats in 2004 so they think no one wins without cheating
7394503 why is the emphasis on that fellow and not for example on eight gold medal winner michael phelps both those guys are just freakish athletes
7394504 i went down there to open it in 2005 but since then there hasnt been the political will to fund it
7394505 its not specifically america what youve seen is the fight against doping has resulted in a lot of athletes who might not have previously got on the podium now getting there
7394506 relatively clean countries like great britain and australia are now coming through
7394507 nah its a chainsaw on a stick how cool is that have a beer and throttle down mr wet blanket on our chainsaw on a stick
7394508 you have to ask yourself why these conditions have persisted so long despite mayoral and council candidates repeatedly running for election promising to restore basic services and focus on neighborhoods

7394512 through the skill and vision of producer jody lloyd what has resulted is a hybridised form that invites the listener to interpret layers of sensuous details
7394513 we approached poets who have had success both on the stage and the page and looked for music by songwriters enriched by thought provoking lyrics
7394514 we aimed for more of an accidental synergy instead of a deliberate crossover when fusing these elements

7394520 over a dispute that at most involves limited american interests
7394521 its clear the policies we have pursued regarding missile defense and installations in europe and regarding further expansion of nato have created difficulties with russia it takes two to tango

7394523 the new king said to his people look the israelite people are more numerous and more powerful than we come let us deal shrewdly with them or they will increase and in the event of war join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land therefore they set taskmasters over them to oppress them with forced labor they the israelites built supply cities pithom and rameses for pharaoh but the more they were oppressed the more they multiplied and spread so that the egyptians came to dread the israelites the egyptians became ruthless in imposing tasks on the israelites and made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and brick and in every kind of field labor they were ruthless in all the tasks that they imposed on them

7394534 so youre probably talking about 20 per cent of the new project and relative to the rest of the roading network its sort of less than two or three per cent
7394535 we want to get that road built because it is the best thing you could do for hamilton
7394536 we want to see it completed as quick as possible and the reality is it is not going to get built under current proposals because it is outside the 10 year plan
7394537 personally i would want to see a toll free link between hamilton and auckland
7394538 there is a place for public private partnerships but we have to be extra careful we dont get into a position where the losses are in the public domain and profits in the private domain
7394539 and whatever funding mix we have we dont want to be paying double we are already paying petrol tax
7394540 the unveiling was a celebration for her and a chance for us to say our last goodbye

7394568 only two things are infinte the universe and the human stupidity and i am not too sure about the former
7394569 love is the condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own im looking for something to do so i could help how do you want these applications coded as a prx that takes arguments or as a separate application which you would launch from project4 and then go back to project4 after exit i could work on the calender first i havent programmed in a while so id like to refresh myself with something simple like that after which i could move on to the music player and calculator dont have much experience with movies and the internet browser seems like it requires teamwork hp 17
7394570 we did exactly as mother instructed and didnt ask any questions
7394571 the capture of abu tiba and abu othman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the aqi network
7394572 there were photographers there and i told them exactly where i was going to go i said right there make sure you wait for me there its just a positive attitude
7394573 they kept telling me push push push and i was pushing to the limit
7394574 that was fun a lot of fun oh my god this is awesome weve been close so often we never lost faith this is great for detroit
7394575 we would not have won this race if helio hadnt driven the wheels off it when he needed to we will keep going and see where we end up at the end of the year
7394576 i think our approach next weekend is the same we go for broke thats the only thing that is going to get us where we need to be
7394577 it was definitely a bad day we lost a ton of points
7394578 this is a race thats very tough unfortunately we got the bad end of the stick i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
7394579 i think if helio wins the next two races we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that
7394580 we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
7394581 im not upset with anybody particularly we just did absolutely nothing right
7394582 its safe to say its gone beyond my wildest expectations and my expectations were really high
7394583 the results from this survey clearly show that these games were truly a cultural event
7394584 elaborate upon his stated intention to reduce the number of abortions by providing alternative programs
7394585 if we create or become a mirror image of the religious right we have failed
7394586 but if we have increased the number of chairs around the table then weve succeeded
7394587 people of faith are being engaged in the convention in a new and robust way and its because of senator obamas acknowledgment that people of faith and values have an important place in american public life
7394588 now theres a genuine interest in speaking with groups and religious groups who were previously considered enemies
7394589 there still is a possibility that obama will chip into the republican advantage with this religious outreach
7394590 even if he gains just a few points that could be decisive in a close election
7394591 despite all the effort there is little evidence religious votes are shifting
7394592 if we create or become a mirror image of the religious right we have failed
7394593 i think pam needs to come clean as the video speaks for itself and that is evidence that a person cannot deny mr lazenbys longtime friend and spokesman michael sands said
7394594 a cocktail of prescription painkillers ambien sleeping pills and rum or vodka each night and during the day
7394595 george is just devastated mr sands said of the custody battle
7394596 he is a loving father who has had his name smeared
7394597 you can hear and see pam acknowledging it was ok for george jr then aged two and a half to take sips of beer mr sands said
7394598 a viol ncia e a persuas o podem destruir a verdade mas n o podem substitu la
7394599 i didnt even know the dnc was in town i dont watch the news
7394600 if i had known i would have done things differently it was a simple mistake
7394601 the speaker was never in any danger and she appreciates the quick and professional response of the police
7394602 it is important to know that we are united in our determination to turning around america
7394603 and by united i mean all of us the afl cio the nea change to win 17 million members 38 million potential voters in union households
7394604 i know we can count on the nea the afl cio and change to win
7394605 the reality is that this is going to be barack obamas week
7394606 we dont have any illusions about the challenges we face in getting our message out but you cant expect people to cover you if you dont show up
7394607 there should be a balance and we want to make sure were available to tell the other side of the story
7394608 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7394609 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7394610 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7394611 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7394612 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7394613 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7394614 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7394615 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7394616 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7394617 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7394618 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7394619 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7394620 n o me adaptei quele lado do campo onde havia um pouco de vento
7394621 a nica explica o que infelizmente n o sou muito dada a este tipo de competi es
7394622 foi bom ter apanhado aqui este banhozinho esta tareiazinha e agora ir para casa descansar
7394623 whats important here is that this isnt about the u s and russia
7394624 they are trying to keep instruments to suffocate georgia and create further trouble at any moment
7394625 we must speed up our work to achieve membership of the european system of security and raise the defense capabilities of the country only these steps will guarantee our security and the integrity of our borders
7394626 why dont people who are pro life adopt children more and why do they also seem to be against helping out poor women
7394627 our rallies have attracted hundreds of thousands of people in the past nearly 15 days which were all peaceful
7394628 a equipe se comportou bem teve chances no primeiro tempo como goi s tamb m teve n s precisamos da vit ria para passar tranq ilidade para o grupo a as bolas passam a entrar com mais tranq ilidade
7394629 a vit ria isso mas n o esconde que a gente tem que trabalhar muito que a gente tem que se dedicar bastante e sair dessa situa o inc moda
7394630 a gente convivendo facilita voc v que s vezes foi at dif cil para fazer uma substitui o hoje domingo voc tem que encaixar a pe a certa no setor certo alguns jogadores a gente conhece outros n o e o pessoal daqui deu um apoio muito bacana
7394631 a situa o muito complicada n s n o queremos voltar segunda divis o montamos um time para n o cair e estamos nos esfor ando para n o cair n o podemos nos conformar com a presen a na zona de rebaixamento
7394632 as pessoas viviam me dizendo que a porta para a vit ria finalmente se abriria e hoje domingo finalmente a escancaramos
7394633 que incr vel esfor o da penske nem sei como agradec los
7394634 estou muito excitado pois o caro estava extremamente r pido para mim foi realmente divertido for ar e for ar a cada volta durante toda a corrida n o poupamos combust vel simplesmente fomos indo e indo e isto valeu a pena no final
7394635 poder amos dormir na vice lideran a sabido que em um campeonato longo h momentos de turbul ncia mas ainda estamos no g 4 e temos a possibilidade de melhorar nossa classifica o no s bado sa mos frustrados porque n o vencemos mesmo tendo muitas possibilidades
7394636 o botafogo passa a ser uma equipe mais estuda e daqui para frente n o tem jogo f cil mesmo nas nossas vit rias n o tivemos facilidade imagino que todos os jogos at o fim ser o equilibrados mas espero sair com vit ria
7394637 n o estou bravo com ningu m particularmente simplesmente fizemos absolutamente nada certo
7394638 tudo que fizemos estava errado e ainda perdemos uma tonelada de pontos esta foi uma corrida muito dura mas infelizmente ficamos com o final ruim
7394639 i am sure the russians have left other surprises for us
7394640 they want to disrupt our life and our economy as much as possible
7394641 its been quiet where i was for the past two weeks but now i am worried even though i am happy to be back
7394642 i am afraid that what happened here with the russians will happen again
7394643 the situation in the black sea is tending to become more tense
7394644 nato countries are building up their naval presence to deliver humanitarian aid i do not think that this will contribute to the stabilization of the situation in the region
7394645 it is still not safe in certain other villages with high concentrations of cluster munitions
7394646 we had been living in mud hut with a bunch of stinky soldiers
7394647 we were ready to get back and get back into a real bed i had a bunch of stories i wanted to write on the campaign
7394648 the vehicle was crawling around at that point and then we struck it its not really a sound a shock wave more than anything you hear this pop blast pop blast basically thats it then you hear the sound of crunching metal when the vehicle rolls over
7394649 basically they knew they had a couple of civilians so first protocol was to get everybody out of the vehicle
7394650 there was gasoline dripping all over me i was searching around for my helmet the soldier had the composure to say get out of the vehicle get out of the vehicle i was hesitant because i didnt have my helmet but he got us out
7394651 basically we climbed out of the gunner hatch and we were exposed pretty much basically in the desert typically what happens in these ied strikes is that it hits one of the cars itll pop and as the soldiers get out of the vehicle theyll taliban start hitting the soldiers with mortars and an ak 47 fire we were kinda worried that it would happen again but it didnt we were able to walk out of it
7394652 i dont think you come into a situation thinking that youre walking into the safest place in the world this isnt child games theyre playing out here its serious stuff
7394653 i was prepared for what it was but you never quite expect that youre going to be stuck in an ied strike inches away from death
7394654 i would say no they are not winning the war i think what youre seeing though is a substantial evolution in the nature of the terrorist threat globally
7394655 theyre becoming much more sophisticated in terms of launching hit and run attacks that look very senstational but in fact do not fundamentally change the balance of security on the ground
7394656 we know weve got our work cut out for us we know that with a potential canadian and american election in the works thetaliban is going to be looking to sensationalize their agenda there
7394657 thats part of the terrorist playbook is to try and intimidate canadians are not going to be intimidated weve got more grit than that
7394658 saio chateado comigo mesmo pelas quatro derrotas mas futebol assim mesmo vou continuar torcendo pelo crici ma e a vida segue espero que o crici ma v bem que consiga melhorar e brigar por coisa melhor na s rie b
7394659 mood and narcissistic personality disorders and borderline and histrionic personality traits
7394660 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7394661 hes comfortable on the attack and that will serve the ticket well
7394662 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7394663 its pretty easy to fall in love with joe biden
7394664 even his mistakes you have a tendency to shake your head and say but thats joe
7394665 and hes known as being long winded on top of that
7394666 mostly i think what attracted sen obama was bidens wisdom
7394667 and not the kind of wisdom you get in washington d c but the kind of wisdom you get when you overcome adversity tragedy in your life as he has the kind of wisdom you get in the working class communities of scranton pa and wilmington del
7394668 you took care of me in the worst time of my life
7394669 be home at my ballgames and be at the dinner table
7394670 he puts kids health safety and education at the top of his priorities list
7394671 along with his wife jill biden has been a longtime leader in the fight against breast cancer
7394672 commitment to family will resonate with women voters across this country
7394673 he very self consciously tried to shore up his support from women voters after the anita hill episode
7394674 i had the button on my backpack and the whole deal
7394675 people know him big time and everything he does is reported by philadelphia television
7394676 i dont know maybe i have a little romanticized view because i love the place so much
7394677 hes plain spoken and down to earth and will resonate in working class areas
7394678 its not a situation where you should have to have a mentor or a trainer or a superviser
7394679 i was running against him man what did they expect me to do lean over and hug him and say yeah he was the most experienced he has plenty of experience hey man the only thing i had going was experience
7394680 he has worked the condos i have worked the condos with joe biden before in my district people will be excited and fired up
7394681 if they knew about it for any period of time without notifying without getting information out thats a serious concern
7394682 im so important look at me as i drive my bmw and talk on a blue tooth 24 7
7394683 the virginia credit union is a not for profit organization owned by members so we truly want members to be successful with their finances one of the ways we give back is through financial education to members and the community we feel like its a vital key for success in a persons life
7394684 elaborate upon his stated intention to reduce the number of abortions by providing alternative programs
7394685 if we create or become a mirror image of the religious right we have failed
7394686 but if we have increased the number of chairs around the table then weve succeeded
7394687 people of faith are being engaged in the convention in a new and robust way and its because of senator obamas acknowledgment that people of faith and values have an important place in american public life
7394688 now theres a genuine interest in speaking with groups and religious groups who were previously considered enemies
7394689 there still is a possibility that obama will chip into the republican advantage with this religious outreach
7394690 even if he gains just a few points that could be decisive in a close election
7394691 the question for me is not so much whether st marys should be closed down but whether st marys will close itself down by practices that separate it from communion with the roman catholic church
7394692 nevertheless only extreme recklessness would place a buddhist statue in a christian church
7394693 no matter where that takes place there is every possibility it would arouse angry feelings particularly with christians from different religious cultures
7394694 but its own style of worship and sacramental practice can hardly be described as roman catholic
7394695 as such it is out of communion with the roman catholic archdiocese of brisbane and universal roman catholic church under the leadership of the bishop of rome
7394696 im not particularly hopeful myself but its up to the community they will find the right solution
7394697 we have been actively engaged in this since the news of this kidnapping occurred
7394698 we have deployed additional staff from our mission in pretoria to our high commission in nairobi which is handling this case at a consular level
7394699 the dfat consular officials are providing consular assistance to the family in australia which have asked im simply referring to their request have asked the media to respect their privacy at this difficult time
7394700 this is a sensitive and difficult case but you need to know that we are engaged at every level on this at every level on this
7394701 bread from a small town about 20 miles from rome
7394702 why dont you always make this bread and quit messing around with lesser loaves
7394703 we have agreed to launch a joint education training and employment initiative which will come back to us with specific recommendations for action by years end
7394704 in particular what we are looking at is the needs in the timor leste public sector and its public service for an intensified training program grassroots middle level and senior level in order to make sure that east timor is properly equipped to address its challenges for development
7394705 hes got some major problems like internal bleeding and hes on dialysis so his kidneys are failing again and they are talking again about suspected pneumonia so they are three bad reports
7394706 everything is down and its not looking good but weve still got hope
7394707 give poor kids bionic healthcare you dont need to sell drugs when you can help the military with your jumping and running abilities
7394708 i think the writing was on the wall that the agreement was going to lead to problems for our hospital rather quickly and it did
7394709 theyre not making as much money as they were before
7394710 theres no denying there are frustrations among members of our medical staff
7394711 you look at the schedule down the road it is concerning
7394712 ive gone on record saying the present system we have is going to lead to temporary closures and a real threat it could lead to permanent closure
7394713 its going to be disastrous people of the area are going to suffer or even die
7394714 they were farther out than you would want to be
7394715 but he probably wouldve been played out hed never have got back to shore with towing the other fella
7394716 it was everything on a farm that a man had to do
7394717 if recent russian actions are any indicator a technical excuse to completely block us access to the iss for geopolitical reasons would fit nicely into the kremlin toolkit
7394718 almost immediately after the czech republic signed an agreement with the us to place missile defense tracking radar in its territory oil supplies through the druzhba pipeline to the central european country were reduced to a trickle ostensibly for technical reasons
7394719 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia
7394720 degrade and burn up on rentry or with us ceding it to those who can get there
7394721 if anything at all in that five years period goes wrong with the russian soyuz then we have no system to access the space station
7394722 while it is possible that government to government issues could potentially have an impact on other aspects of a relationship between nations including cooperative space exploration activities nasa believes that it will be able to rely upon roscosmos provided soyuz vehicles for future space station activities
7394723 as long as russia can be said to be abiding by the terms of the cease fire in georgia
7394724 there is an issue but i dont think its so strong to prevent the waiver from passing as long as russian behavior is what it has been agreed to on georgia
7394725 great concept great outline great sample chapter we wont touch it
7394726 there was a lot of institutional selling in sterling mr waterer said
7394727 on the back of that we saw some other currencies fall such as the euro and the australian dollar
7394728 it was a follow on from the falls in fridays session
7394729 a stronger us dollar weaker gold theme has seen the aussie dollar retrace below the 0 8650 level mr waterer said
7394730 gold fell on the stronger us dollar and commodity currencies like the aussie have fallen on the back of that
7394731 the main drivers for the local currency will be gold and oil prices throughout the asian session he said
7394732 hes got some major problems like internal bleeding and hes on dialysis so his kidneys are failing again and they are talking again about suspected pneumonia so they are three bad reports
7394733 everything is down and its not looking good but weve still got hope
7394734 mama got up in the morning and made herself pretty for the day
7394735 be very aware of what you are ingesting from the water the earth the air and what it may do to your body and especially to your childrens bodies because they get higher doses of all environmental contaminants take responsibility if you dont who will and when
7394736 we are here we have a lot of people we have a lot of money
7394737 the question for me is not so much whether st marys should be closed down but whether st marys will close itself down by practices that separate it from communion with the roman catholic church
7394738 nevertheless only extreme recklessness would place a buddhist statue in a christian church
7394739 no matter where that takes place there is every possibility it would arouse angry feelings particularly with christians from different religious cultures
7394740 but its own style of worship and sacramental practice can hardly be described as roman catholic
7394741 as such it is out of communion with the roman catholic archdiocese of brisbane and universal roman catholic church under the leadership of the bishop of rome
7394742 im not particularly hopeful myself but its up to the community they will find the right solution
7394743 everyone here was in a state of shock when the news came through
7394744 the company sees little improvement in the underlying earnings in fiscal 2009 due to uncertainty around commodity costs and future economic conditions in australia and new zealand the company said
7394745 the company is more optimistic for the fiscal 2010 year and expects to see the benefits flow through from significant capital expenditure and resulting efficiency gains combined with softening commodity prices
7394746 this quarter we will take another 200 employees out of our business he said
7394747 over the next 12 months over and above that we will probably take out another 150 to 200 employees
7394748 what you are seeing however are some shifts in the types of products that consumers are buying he said
7394749 indeed there has been a continuing migration to house brand products whether it be bread or milk or these types of related staples
7394750 that will continue at least in the short term certainly with a softening economy here and what many analysts are probably calling a recessionary economy more in new zealand
7394751 after watching the olympics it really motivated me to come here and get better times
7394752 i kind of remembered how michael phelps did it and tried to swim like him he is just so good
7394753 we have had unprecedented interest in auditions for swim teams
7394754 we are maxed out in four of eight practice groups and we expect to fill everything
7394755 we typically enjoy a membership spike the year after every olympics
7394756 we hope that will be larger than normal because of the phelps phenomenon
7394757 what he has done is so phenomenal and the way he has done it makes his appeal universal
7394758 it was really worth it to see him break that world record
7394759 we have a black population and there are some kids who gravitate to swimming because of race and identifying with cullen
7394760 they are ordinary and very kind they eat like us they live like us and they are very interested in the organic food of correns they decided to move here after visiting other homes in the region
7394761 many of you know that i am a founding director of the technology leadership political action committee a bipartisan organization that will increase participation among southern californias high tech community to impact public policy issues vital to economic growth and quality of life in our region in my work with tech companies ive seen first hand how companies that set aside the time and funds to build their corporate reputation through public relations and government advocacy accelerate faster than those that dont in my new blog entry on the tlpac site i talk about how to compete for corporate reputation by garnering government support in doing business id love to get your comments and hear your stories about your companys own political advocacy work go to http www tlpac com page id 9
7394762 trivializing ones anatomy through immature humor isnt really the type of nurturing example i should be setting for my son
7394763 you have never seen more dedicated from the heart people
7394764 itll be good because you get tired of looking at an old building
7394765 combat nationalism that is always very fast in spreading on these sporting occasions
7394766 britains amazing athletes have shown us how britain can be one of the best in sport
7394767 the german french italian and dutch teams have all done well too it is bonkers to claim that all our countries athletes would do better if they were put into one team and made to compete under an eu flag
7394768 why on earth is the european commission lavishing taxpayers money on these euro federalists to come up with nutty ideas like this
7394769 their funding should be scrapped and put to better use giving it back to european countries to help their sportsmen is one option that springs to mind
7394770 this is a very cruel thing to foist upon our wonderful athletes who have so proudly flown the flag here
7394771 team gb means great britain on 19 occasions the union flag has been flown at the top of the pole and they have been very proud moments for all the athletes i think this notion that we all get together and fly the eu flag is ridiculous there are 27 countries joined at the hip under the eu but we have all got our individual freedoms to represent our nations at the olympic games
7394772 at the heart of all this is the simple fact that these people want to create a single country called europe
7394773 our westminster politicians try to pretend otherwise but ideas like this let the cat out of the bag
7394774 like so many people around the world i have followed their endeavours with great interest and admiration
7394775 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7394776 what it must have felt like to be hunted down hundreds of miles from home to have been through that day to be wounded terrified desperate what was that like
7394777 just look at the money china has spent on infrasturcture ports roads
7394778 i think pam needs to come clean as the video speaks for itself and that is evidence that a person cannot deny mr lazenbys longtime friend and spokesman michael sands said
7394779 a cocktail of prescription painkillers ambien sleeping pills and rum or vodka each night and during the day
7394780 george is just devastated mr sands said of the custody battle
7394781 he is a loving father who has had his name smeared
7394782 you can hear and see pam acknowledging it was ok for george jr then aged two and a half to take sips of beer mr sands said
7394783 we have been actively engaged in this since the news of this kidnapping occurred
7394784 we have deployed additional staff from our mission in pretoria to our high commission in nairobi which is handling this case at a consular level
7394785 the dfat consular officials are providing consular assistance to the family in australia which have asked im simply referring to their request have asked the media to respect their privacy at this difficult time
7394786 this is a sensitive and difficult case but you need to know that we are engaged at every level on this at every level on this
7394787 we have a situation where an enormous amount of time is spent each sitting day by ministerial staff and department employees including senior public servants preparing answers to questions for ministers in both houses many of whom will never be asked any questions he said in a statement
7394788 if you cannot answer a questions in two minutes you probably cannot answer it at all he said
7394789 and modify the value right click and click modify and change it to the
7394790 i am looking forward to handing over a gb shirt to kate ellis because they were shocked that we thought we could get anywhere near them in the medal table
7394791 weve beaten them we have got more gold medals and indeed more medals
7394792 a party that took a long time coming but was over in a jiffy
7394793 there was always a feeling when i was growing up that british sportsmen did well but then they fell at the final hurdle always the plucky losers thats changed now
7394794 perhaps the best thing about winning two medals was that not one aussie came up to us and said well done they are really full of it when they win medals and tell us how great they are they could not even make eye contact with us
7394795 for those in other parts of the world who public art
7394796 gt link to read a really engaging article about pa by roberta smith in the nyt she credits museum of contemporary art in chicago for making public art popular yes artwranglers will be making

7394799 xbox live is the worlds fastest growing online social network on tv
7394800 we doubled our membership the past two years growing from 3 million to 6 million and then from 6 million to 12 million and today we are adding a new member every five seconds with the best and broadest social entertainment experiences launching this fall the future is limitless
7394801 no social order ever perishes before all the productive forces for which there is room in it have developed
7394802 workers can rule only where the capitalist system has achieved a high level of development
7394803 opposed eurocentric schemas and populist efforts to rally workers behind different factions of the bourgeoisie
7394804 set about recapturing inca communism as a precursor of socialist struggles
7394805 socialist from its beginnings but would go through two stages
7394806 this socialist revolution would be marked by a junction with the historic basis of socialization the indigenous communities the survivals of primitive agrarian communism
7394807 was replaced by the echo of stalins mediocre schemas in the ussr
7394808 with the rise of the cuban revolution and the leadership of castro and guevara
7394809 revived the revolutionary marxism of the 1920s simultaneously anti imperialist and anti capitalist as well as marxs more unfamiliar works above all his later works that study colonialism and peripheral and dependent societies in these writings marx overcomes the eurocentric views of his youth
7394810 subjugated peoples do not experience progress so long as they remain under the boot of imperialism
7394811 the commune is the fulcrum for social regeneration in russia
7394812 the vitality of primitive communities was incomparably greater than that of semitic greek roman etc societies and a fortiori that of modern capitalist societies
7394813 as evidence of resistance to the penetration of state associated institutions
7394814 this is the revolution against karl marxs capital in russia marxs capital was more the book of the bourgeoisie than of the proletariat
7394815 the purest forms of scientific socialism invariably proved politically impotent
7394816 it has been the integration of marxism with the indigenous i e home grown political traditions which has underlain all known cases of internally generated and politically effective revolutionary transformation of society by socialists
7394817 we certainly do not wish socialism in america to be a copy and imitation it must be a heroic creation we must give life to an indo american socialism reflecting our own reality and in our own language
7394818 called upon by history to convert ourselves into the vanguard of the struggle to defend nature and life
7394819 each was a part of all and all were of the soil the soil could never belong to us because we are its sons and daughters and we belong to the soil
7394820 it is capitalist society that rejects materialism it makes war on the material world and destroys it we on the other hand embrace the material world consider ourselves part of it and care for it
7394821 considering the nature of the attack and the kind of weapons used in the attack we apprehend that some extremists who are active in the state are involved in the crime
7394822 its got nothing to do with maoism its been done by the church which has failed to baptise the people because of swamijis presence in the district in the last 42 years
7394823 we strongly condemn this heinous crime we are not aware who have done it but whoever have done it are criminals and criminals dont have any religion
7394824 all told egypt has received over 50 billion in us largesse since 1975
7394825 israel has had in place a shadow government in washington
7394826 you are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars you have a right to be here and whether or not it is clear to you no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should
7394827 the universe is unfolding the way it is unfolding the way it can unfold period
7394828 i could not then truthfully deny that this book which came out in 1968 as a greenleaf classic was mine
7394829 changed names and identities all incidents i have described have been taken from actual experiences
7394830 i have often wished i had two penises to enjoy simultaneously the double but different sensations of oral and genital copulation
7394831 im not one to go in for lolitas usually id rather not bed a babe under 20
7394832 but there are exceptions i didnt want to disappoint the trusting child at her still impressionistic age a rejection might be traumatic could even cripple her sexually for life
7394833 anne came up many times the next several weeks her aunt thinking she was in good hands actually she was
7394834 she obtained a course in practical sex from experienced and considerate practitioners rather than from ignorant insensitive neophytes i think we did her a favour although the pleasure was mutual
7394835 a certification of birth also known as a short form birth certificate the long form is drawn up by the hospital and includes additional information such as birth weight and parents hometowns
7394836 the hawaii department of healths birth record request form does not give the option to request a photocopy of your long form birth certificate but their short form has enough information to be acceptable to the state department we tried to ask the hawaii doh why they only offer the short form among other questions but they have not given a response
7394837 recently factcheck representatives got a chance to spend some time with the birth certificate and we can attest to the fact that it is real and three dimensional and resides at the obama headquarters in chicago
7394838 we couldnt get someone on the phone in hawaii to tell us whether the number represented some secret information and we erred on the side of blacking it out since then weve found out its pretty irrelevant for the outside world
7394839 potentially if you have that number you could break into the system
7394840 they responded and apparently it isnt good enough that he posted his birth certificate
7394841 they say they want it because they claim he is not a citizen of the united states its pretty ridiculous
7394842 about 2 000 organised zionists and 7 000 to 8 000 agents of zionism have dragged the world into turmoil
7394843 the powerful hand of the nations will clean these sources of corruption from the face of the earth
7394844 and an ideological war it is our country and we will defend it
7394845 the world is losing the war i think at the moment they the taleban definitely have the upper hand
7394846 the issue which is not just a bad case scenario as far as pakistan is concerned or as afghanistan is concerned but it is going to be spreading further the whole world is going to be affected by it
7394847 a lot of them have lost parents to hiv aids and their last picture of them with their parents
7394848 its really traumatic for me to think that somebody would do this
7394849 the way he did this he wanted my dad to suffer by setting him on fire
7394850 he was committed to his family and to his community
7394851 he gave of himself freely he was always there to be a helping hand hes what makes civic organizations so powerful and effective in their communities
7394852 its incalculable leaders like him are not born every day
7394853 we want to keep italian culture alive but part of that is being open
7394854 we are not exclusive to italians but a gift from italians to the city
7394855 if they knew about it for any period of time without notifying without getting information out thats a serious concern
7394856 is not so much whether st marys should be closed down but whether st marys will close itself down by practices that separate it from communion with the roman catholic church
7394857 in reality st marys south brisbane has taken a roman catholic parish and established its own brand of religion
7394858 undoubtedly it does good it promotes a strong sense of community opens its doors to all who wish to come but its own style of worship and sacramental practice can hardly be described as roman catholic
7394859 im not particularly hopeful myself but its up to the community they will find the right solution
7394860 canon 3 we absolutely forbid priests deacons and subdeacons to associate with concubines and women or to live with women other than such as the nicene council canon 3 for reasons of necessity permitted namely the mother sister or aunt or any such person concerning whom no suspicion could arise
7394861 while these versions did protect against the vulnerabilities discussed in the bulletin they lacked other important security and reliability updates
7394862 this only affected the packages on the microsoft download center microsoft update and office update contained and were distributing the correct versions of the binaries and did not need to be updated
7394863 if you choose to not reinstall the update you must manually set the registry key in order to block powerpoint file types as a workaround
7394864 we dont know something like that this far in advance
7394865 boc knowingly assisted hamas and the islamic jihad to carry out terrorist attacks with the full approval of the chinese government and rejected requests by the israeli government to cease and desist boc even had the chutzpah to make these funds transfers through its u s branches right under the nose of the justice department despite the fact that hamas and the pij are designated terrorist organizations and that such wire transfers are a crime under american law we expect boc to now pay very heavily for its support for terrorism
7394866 sunrise from a 747 photo that ive used as the header for a while now taken in feb 2000 on the return flight from my first ever overseas trip
7394867 ridiculous we all know that anti semitism and race charges are like nitroglycerine charges like these cause people to lose sight of the real issues and i think it is designed to create a level of hysteria
7394868 inserting the sabbath feature in the contract proposal without seeking the boards approval
7394869 investigate the recommendation from the baltimore city fire dept regarding ovens being left on during the sabbath
7394870 do these board members really believe that one elevator operating in shabbos mode for a few hours a week is going to have a detrimental effect on their lives while they were upgrading the elevators residents got along just fine with one elevator for months
7394871 this to me is pure form blatant bigotry masquerading as a concern over costs the cost issue should have been completely dissolved by mr hackermans generous offer and thats what the human relations commission found
7394872 its sad that theres a dispute over the inconvenience to people having an elevator stop on every floor once a week and on certain religious holidays
7394873 the government gets involved when people cant work these issues out on their own
7394874 but sometimes the state is obligated to say you must make a reasonable accommodation
7394875 i came up with the thought that this has to do with the first amendment protections it violated peoples religious rights in multiple dwelling residences operative word was reasonable this would have been reasonable and accommodating i see at as a protection
7394876 my clients arent going to put up with this they feel the investigation was pre determined also theres the cost of the feature its the extra wear and tear if you take one elevator out of general service its a real loss
7394877 hrc did a thorough investigation and that it ruled there was probable cause of discrimination and found no merit in any of the complaints made by the board
7394878 the condo has a reputation that people dont get along
7394879 i want to live in a normal environment where people dont hate each other but its not happening

7394887 global health it provider and the company had prepared a strong platform for growth
7394888 we have an international footprint of over 13 000 customers providing substantial recurring revenues and a base primed for the release of our products mr cohen said
7394889 full year 2009 will see the global launch of our unique platform lorenzo delivering a service oriented health care platform to our existing customers
7394890 the key relationships with national health service in the united kingdom and the irish health service executive have been enhanced at the strategic and operational levels and additional contracted revenues secured mr cohen said
7394891 long term contract renewals have also been achieved in europe while in australia and south east asia iba has continued to be successful in winning new business in the state acute hospitals sector and with significant corporate players in the primary care sector
7394892 this forecast has been buoyed by the anticipated synergies from the mackay permanent acquisition but at the same time has been tempered with caution in lending operations and wholesale funding costs
7394893 we will monitor the market over coming months for the opportunity to further recoup these additional costs on wholesale funding
7394894 id say we gonna have a related class maybe a priest cultist or something like that
7394895 faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
7394896 what is faith but believing what you do not see
7394897 i have faith that it has thundered in the past and will again in the future
7394898 make yourself believe that there is a god no matter what the evidence on the question may be
7394899 more than 50 per cent of the 600 people surveyed drink wine on three days of the week or more
7394900 rocs operational and financial results for the half year have been somewhat overshadowed by the decline in the companys share price since the announcement of the proposed anzon takeover mr clement said
7394901 if successful roc will more than double its 2p reserves and increase its forecast production in 2010 to over 20 000 boepd barrels of oil equivalent per day
7394902 the takeover will immediately increase operating cash flow for the company by up to 50 per cent and expose roc to significant upside reserves potential from the development of the basker manta gummy project in bass strait over the next 18 months a corker too dear to drink
7394903 warts and all securities lending review has glossed over one large ugly carbuncle the bank may yet bail out the stock lender and broker tricom
7394904 ring fencing tricoms 81 million loan book and now anz is once again exposed to the losses
7394905 we are continuing to support our customer was all the bank would say this morning
7394906 no comment was the official line when asked if anz would stump up cash to bail out tricom anz already owns 11 5 of tricom as does babcock amp brown after the two struck a band aid rescue deal this year
7394907 new broom at anz ceo mike smith can hardly blame his predecessor john macfarlane any more
7394908 the gravity of the issues relating to the equity finance business should have been but was not properly brought to the attention of the chief executive of the board smacks of buck passing of the highest order
7394909 ring fencing of the loan book and the general state of financial markets this means there is no agreement on who has liability for the debts in the loan book
7394910 we have issues and we are trying to deal with them he said yesterday

7394912 the parties will consider the feasibility of the chemical facility supplying the majority of arafuras chemical needs for its rare earth facility including hydrochloric and sulphuric acid and caustic soda
7394913 to tell you the truth we didnt expect rand uridashis to keep their popularity for this long said hiroshi kannoo the manager of foreign fixed income assets at rakuten securities which sells uridashis through its website
7394914 many uridashi investors dont give it a second glance if the coupon is below 10 said tsutomu soma senior manager of foreign assets at okasan securities
7394915 uridashis in rand and other exotic currencies keep coming due to retail investors quest for higher yields and novel products said tohru sasaki chief foreign exchange strategist at jpmorgan chase bank in tokyo
7394916 that trend is supported by a structural issue here and is expected to stay mr sasaki said
7394917 we distributed turkish lira bonds for the first time in march the sale went surprisingly well said rakutens mr kannoo
7394918 rouble bonds are also popular despite their coupons that are about half the lira bonds he said
7394919 much of this margin growth is due to our exposure to the downstream electricity market through our throughput ownership of the daandine and townsville power stations where prices have been very strong
7394920 another record year in financial 2009 and was well positioned to build on the firm base it had created
7394921 much of this margin growth is due to our exposure to the downstream electricity market through our throughput ownership of the daandine and townsville power stations where prices have been very strong mr davies said a corker too dear to drink
7394922 the group consultation with its lenders has concluded that no proposal received to date provides acceptable outcome which is in the best interests of all relevant stakeholders
7394923 the group believes that in particular given current difficult capital market conditions an acceptable proposal capable of being implemented by 15 december 2008 is unlikely to be forthcoming
7394924 in the absence of a recapitalisation solution in the short term the groups objective therefore is to obtain longer term debt extensions from the lender groups beyond 15 december 2008 to provide a more stabilised environment for the recapitalisation process to be pursued over a longer time frame
7394925 the group has commenced discussions with the lender groups on possible terms for longer term debt extension and stabilisation of the group
7394926 it is likely that those terms would include a requirement for the conversion of a portion of debt into some form of hybrid security
7394927 this may impact the value of the groups existing ordinary equity
7394928 were also seeing the resources sector holding up despite a mixed bag of metal prices overnight
7394929 at this stage the market looks like it may remain relatively well bid by the end of the day but it wouldnt surprise me if we did see some profit taking later on
7394930 hybrids instruments after rejecting proposals for new equity because the offers didnt provide an
7394931 while the asset sale program will provide the group with liquidity and some level of debt reduction the group considers that asset sales alone will not provide a long term recapitalisation solution centro said in a statement to investors
7394932 the group has also received and evaluated a number of proposals for new equity
7394933 apparently she has even gotten into trouble with the ethiopian orthodox church for singing what is unquestionably the best song on the album the closing
7394934 in belgrade serbia and we are extremely happy with the result
7394935 whatever is done in the name of different religions is often done against mother nature
7394936 the whole kennedy family will be in a special section it should be quite a moment
7394937 you cant take it the wrong way i think the most important thing about it is that i keep putting myself in a good position and unfortunately somebody just seems to be able to come up with some spectacular playing when im out there on top
7394938 i feel like i played solid all week i got a couple bad breaks here and there that maybe would have made the difference and a couple good ones here and there too at the end of the day i had a shot thats what you ask yourself for and vijay came out with the goods and youve just got to give hats off to him
7394939 i think he was surprised to make his and i was surprised to see it go in
7394940 and he was even more surprised to see mine go in i think we were both happy as well
7394941 if i couldnt win im happy that he did i guess
7394942 whoever doesnt think that is obviously blind so i feel good about it i think weve all put a lot of work into it i probably should get the most improved putting stroke for the year unfortunately theres no trophy for that
7394943 ive got a great start and i just have to go ahead and play hard for the next three events the guys behind me the way the system works now the next guy that wins can just overtake you its going to be tough
7394944 but im ahead and ive got a head start so i just have to go out there and play consistent solid golf and hopefully win at the end
7394945 i wasnt expecting to be that high so i really have nothing to lose to get in next week is great to get in the week after that would be great to get in the tour championship would be a dream rookie season
7394946 so i just have to take it one week at a time as we see the volatility in the points if you miss a cut you jump back and if you make it you move way up thats just the fact of the matter if i make next weeks cut and make a top 10 or so put us in good position going into the last two
7394947 this is a great opportunity for indianapolis and for us to be able to tailgate here we have the perfect spot
7394948 i think its been a long time coming and its going to be a nice place tailgater dan mize said
7394949 big brothers big sisters just called and a donor i dont even know who it was gave us the tickets to be able to go i hear they are amazing seats
7394950 im really excited to be with libby and to go into a once in a lifetime grand opening i cant wait
7394951 it was a huge mess as well as a terrible fright it really made a loud noise as it all went flying as soon as i caught my breath and calmed down i took a photo of the mess then i called the front desk and had the doorman come down to see the damage since this occurred after 5 p m
7394952 oh the flooding is a huge issue when there is no wind damage
7394953 most of their relief is going to come from the federal level is going to come from fema and as a result of all of the issues that came after katrina youd like to think its an easier path for our citizens now that a lot of changes have happened at that level
7394954 it was a tough day said singh who went head to head with garcia when sutherland was eliminated on the first hole
7394955 it wasnt easy to get close to the hole so birdie was difficult to come by it was drying out really really a lot and youve got to play almost conservative on some holes
7394956 it was a tough day but it was a great playoff though i enjoyed that
7394957 i think through the past weeks and months and years with the media talking about my putting and writing about my putting and people talking about my putting and people want to help me i must have had hundreds of letters and phone calls and all saying that they can fix my putting said singh who is now 8 4 in playoffs
7394958 you know at the end of the day it kind of gets to your head that youre not a good putter
7394959 so i made a point after last week that you know im going to change that attitude and i believed in myself that im the best putter and i came out here with a different attitude and i putted great this week if i keep doing this im going to win a lot more golf tournaments
7394960 i thought that was one of the worst greens ive ever putted on if you have a mindset on seeded greens that big and that ugly we should never play it really im sure padraig harrington who won the pga championship loves the greens but he played well
7394961 i played really well and just nothing happened he said
7394962 so again the greens were huge so it was a putting event there and every hole had obs left and right and i dont like that
7394963 this tops westchester every single player out there absolutely enjoyed this golf course tee to green its great and on the greens
7394964 my trainer walked on wednesday and he came across that fifth green and said
7394965 definitely everybody thats playing the fedexcup wants to win said singh whos won 33 pga tour events in his career including three majors
7394966 i mean i want to win as much as anybody else but that doesnt prove that im going to win it i have to go out there and do it thats what im looking forward to
7394967 ive got a great start and i just have to go ahead and play hard for the next three other events the guys behind me the way the system works now the next guy that wins can just overtake you its going to be tough but im ahead and ive got a head start so i just have to go out there and play consistent solid golf and hopefully win at the end
7394968 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7394969 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7394970 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7394971 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain
7394972 that message is going to echo clearly from this platform
7394973 the republican track record on national security has not been particularly good
7394974 my job in this campaign is to explain that talking tough and acting dumb is not a way to keep you safe and secure
7394975 we need somebody who talks tough whos going to act smart and be tough thats how were going to look after the safety of the american people
7394976 i dont think hes ready to be president and when youre commander in chief you shouldnt be having to select a mentor to help you with that role

7394993 after extensive discussions and frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
7394994 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
7394995 this was a difficult decision but it was the right one there is nothing more important than the safety of our national team
7394996 we appreciate all the efforts of the icc task team the pakistan cricket board the pakistan authorities and the security consultants the players are naturally disappointed for their fans and the people of pakistan that they will not have a chance to see them in action in that country in september
7394997 we organized we marched i was a public television producer and did shows with black activists we were optimistic not anymore today what do many black kids get a chip on their shoulders and nothing but a long list of grievances black politicians insist on their martin luther king and rosa parks boulevards but ignore those black kids or defend them when they mess up
7394998 thanks for reading that hubert you said you were once a bit of an activist for civil rights and now you sound disillusioned what happened
7394999 i think an opportunity was missed at that point after the assassinations of king and kennedy the challenge was to make something out of their legacies and rather than do that black leadership the supposed voices of the black community and to a large extent many black persons squandered that legacy they have promoted the victim mentality and the perpetual grievance mentality and they have tried to instill the notion in the black community they should remain angry and needy in perpetuity

7395004 uno es hacer que la gente se ponga c moda con barack obama el otro es definir la carrera electoral con claridad estableciendo a obama como un factor de cambio y a mccain como continuaci n de las pol ticas de bush tanto a nivel nacional como en el extranjero
7395005 se trata de aclarar la idea de que las elecciones se realizar n entre dos candidatos y dos partidos pol ticos
7395006 no veo la alegr a que suele darse tras unas primarias
7395007 obama es un tipo que quiere unir al mundo pero que ha dividido al partido dem crata como nunca se hab a visto desde la guerra de vietnam
7395008 siempre estamos buscando oportunidades para poner a nuestra gente manos a la obra en lugar de sentarles c modamente y ponerles a escuchar discursos

7395016 they were some of the worst houses on the street
7395017 we not only did the three houses but weve done two city blocks
7395018 weve been able to provide home repair services paint up fix up services with volunteer labor
7395019 i didnt never think we could get back to this
7395020 it was a boost you know a great boost what they did to help it gave me a boost that i didnt have i didnt have a leg up at all
7395021 we wanted to give the street a little bit of a face lift and help out the neighbors here and give them some more pride and new neighbors
7395022 if you can do this street by street what ever it takes but its got to be everybody getting together everybody sticking together
7395023 ive always been a rock n roll guy at heart and this album is true to that ive taken the sound of a classic 70s rock riff and embodied that in a more modern production the entire feel of the album musically and lyrically is about that rock and roll core

7395025 cher is nolans first choice to play catwoman he wants to her to portray her like a vamp in her twilight years the new catwoman will be the absolute opposite of michelle pfeiffer and halle berrys purring creations
7395026 the outlook for the economy has worsened in recent months and the downside risks to growth have increased the softer labor market together with factors including higher energy prices lower equity prices and declining home values seem likely to weigh on consumer spending in the near term
7395027 the issue of economics is something that ive really never understood as well as i should
7395028 shield all but about 100 estates 99 7 with small business income from any estate taxation
7395029 instead of having all of us pay our fair share weve got over 1 trillion worth of loopholes in the corporate tax code this isnt the invisible hand of the market at work its the successful work of special interests
7395030 im a pro market guy and i always have been what i do get frustrated with is an economy that is out of balance that rewards a very few with rewards that are all out of proportion to their actual success while ordinary hardworking americans continue to get squeezed over the last decade or so this economy grew substantially and more than half of the total growth was captured by the top 1
7395031 unlike sen obama i do not believe that raising taxes is the answer to our economic problems there is no surer way to force jobs overseas than to raise taxes on businesses the american people cannot afford economic policies that will take us backward
7395032 something is seriously wrong when the american people are left to bear the consequences of reckless corporate conduct while the offenders themselves are packed off with another 40 million or 50 million for the road
7395033 mccain has repeatedly claimed that obama would raise tax rates for 23 million small business owners its a false figure we find that the overwhelming majority of those small business owners would see no increase because they earn too little to be affected obamas tax proposal would raise rates only on couples making more than 250 000 or singles earning more than 200 000 mccain argues that obamas proposed increase is a job killer he has a point its true that increasing taxes on those at the top would leave them less money for other purposes including investment and hiring in the case of business owners but the number of business owners who would see their rates go up would be only a small fraction of what mccain says many would see their taxes go down
7395034 yes yes yes great stuff will definitely play them out
7395035 great to see you back with another house monster i absolutely love after the drought proper deep drivin house grooves full support club radio
7395036 epicenter is such an irresistible club track that it could get even stephen hawking on the dancefloor strutting his stuff
7395037 after the drought is the one ill be playing amp charting great track
7395038 wow wow wow both these cuts are dope intense and thick and will be in my playlists for a while to come i guarantee
7395039 really nice tunes here will def play out my fav is after the drought one lovely stuff
7395040 my pick is after the drought here great ross couch signature atmosphere inside love it
7395041 the most important thing is that obama did not choose a woman he needed one with hillarys evident availability for the nomination his failure to name her or some other woman stands out starkly to women voters it doesnt matter to them that he chose biden over bayh or kaine what matters is that he did not choose hillary or another woman now john mccain can take advantage of obamas blunder by coming back with a woman nominee for president texas sen kay bailey hutchison would be an excellent choice shes been around for decades and is not going to start making mistakes now her nomination would be a signal to american women that mccain takes their aspirations seriously even if obama does not hutchison is not charismatic but her circumstances would be if she were nominated the prospect of a woman vice president would electrify women throughout the nation
7395042 if drafted i will not run if nominated i will not accept if elected i will not serve if i serve ill bollocks it up on purpose
7395043 i have to give benedikt credit for seeing past the disrepair and sad state the house had fallen into
7395044 it looked like a rundown motel it had been rented out for 10 to 12 years it was like the ultimate party house
7395045 that it was even in a simpsons episode a house with a for sale sign
7395046 would sit and sit and sit you couldnt give em away people would want to see the view and that was about it
7395047 it was an architecture newly defined it could take on its own brand new shape it displays the optimism of its time that technology can be used to solve any problem just as century city and googies
7395048 the west would not be possible without technology water electricity everything that it took to overcome dryness and distance was dependent in some form on technology
7395049 something i find fascinating about the house is that it is a single family home
7395050 and yet whenever that house is used in the movies its always a decadent bachelor pad you have the reality of southern california life and the image of southern california life summed up in one house
7395051 from the outside it looks like a spaceship which you cannot enter
7395052 but if you go inside it feels very cozy very zen and calming maybe because you are floating above the city above reality in the sky you feel disconnected from the planet and completely free and happy
7395053 my philosophy at the time was most people work their whole lives to build their dream house
7395054 why not build it now and pay for it for the rest of my life
7395055 is that he had this dualism about nature and the city on the other side its very quiet
7395056 its pure nature with all kinds of animals skunks bobcats coyotes deer they are not shy you almost have nose prints on the window
7395057 thats the characteristic of great artists they can make things simple
7395058 organic modernism was just as modern in its use of materials
7395059 but it had a different sense of space which was flowing the way a building was put together was like a tree or a flower or a cave natural forms wright was one of the founders of that approach to modernism and lautner brought it to southern california
7395060 or put him in the category of undisciplined far out do whatever you want california architecture
7395061 the missing link between the classic modernism of the case study houses and the work we now associate with los angeles the more expressive more sculptural forms frank gehry has said that as a student he considered lautner to be a god
7395062 than in a conventional home where the architect has not thought so much about every single detail
7395063 with this house he found and expressed this almost religious spirit with a perfect architectural language in general but also in detail
7395064 you feel safe its warm and human not a cold place you would not expect it from outside
7395065 the maintenance is 10 times higher than in any other building everything is much more complicated to get cable or internet they have to come 10 times
7395066 its like having a vintage car a 55 mercedes more difficult but they have a personality to them ya
7395067 he interrupted me in about half a minute and said in german herr escher why dont you do what you think is right
7395068 i think the hardest thing was developing an intellectual strategy for how to deal with it
7395069 a combination of research into history and technology and to some degree into lautners psychology you cant be afraid of a house like that you have to in some cases be kind of forceful
7395070 we wanted to make it as invisible and elegant as possible
7395071 thats something thats important to all our projects we dont try to draw attention to a detail it should disappear
7395072 pruning a garden to reveal the clarity of the structure
7395073 but we didnt want the house to be a museum of the 1960s
7395074 so you really have to find the right tenant for them taschen was perfect for the house he immediately grasped what the house was about and he was entirely open to our ideas for the place like ripping out the glass and commissioning pieces by artists
7395075 had robbed the soul of the house if you make tiny changes that dont fit the integrity of the house you destroy it its like a movie where you add a scene of someone with a mobile phone in 1958 or a style of shirt or car that wouldnt have existed until years later
7395076 its the responsibility of the owner to preserve it for future generations
7395077 because a house like this doesnt belong to one or two people it belongs to mankind
7395078 the place is much better than when i was in there and its in keeping with lautners vision
7395079 we know that there are three consumers as weve completed the investigations so well bring the charges based upon that but we have many other complaints that are pending and the investigation of those matters is on going
7395080 the specific suit were bringing now we brought in steuben county because we do have a number of people that live in that area that we think will be affected by the outcome of this litigation but the complaint names consumers in hamilton and marion counties
7395081 weve also had misrepresentation on loan documents where people have had their income inflated consumers have actually shown where their income is about 3 500 per month but the documents show 14 000 per month in income
7395082 there are several states that have brought litigation against countrywide and i think were about the sixth attorney general office to do that
7395083 i didnt really feel they needed any more celebrities they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7395084 real greece i suggest you to avoid popular destinations like kos start eating in 30 minutes dinners in a dash 101 fresh light and quick dinner ideas can help you solve your dinner dilemmas dog treat cookbooks
7395085 i think everybody if theyre not struggling themselves theyre aware that the overall economy is declining and theres just a sense of caution
7395086 just the basics the fuel and food prices are enough to be crimping peoples budgets
7395087 were trying to tighten it up as much as we possibly can
7395088 today we can get the fuel but its exploding in cost for us
7395089 weve been dealing with this for quite a few months now
7395090 everything is being passed on even with the cost of fuel going up it doesnt just effect food and gas prices it effects all of our petroleum products like lunch trays
7395091 its affecting restaurants its affecting people buying groceries at the store
7395092 senior year you kind of expect to fork over a lot of money
7395093 i worry about how im going to get them to school i worry about how im going to pay for supplies im just holding on right now but im afraid its going to get a lot worse

7395102 segment of madonnas concert in cardiff on saturday that appeared to draw a comparison between mccain hitler and zimbabwean strongman robert mugabe
7395103 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7395104 image was flashed up alongside images of destruction and global warming as well as hitler and mugabe

7395314 if we go down into ourselves we find that we possess exactly what we desire if we long for a certain being who is dead we desire a particular limited being therefore necessarily a mortal and we long for that special being who to whom etc in short that being who died at such and such a time on such and such a day and we have that being dead if we desire money we want a medium of exchange institution something which can only be acquired on certain conditions so we desire it only in the measure that well in that measure we have it in such cases suffering emptiness are the mode of existence of the objects of our desire we only have to draw aside the veil of unreality and we shall see that they are given to us in this way when we see that we still suffer but we are happy
7395315 evil is limitless but it is not infinite only the infinite limits the limitless monotony of evil never anything new everything about it is equivalent never anything real everything about it is imaginary it is because of this monotony that quantity plays so great a part a host of women don juan or of men c lim ne etc one is condemned to false infinity that is hell itself
7395316 to say that the world is not worth anything that this life is of no value and to give evil as the proof is absurd for if these things are worthless what does evil take from us

7395330 antonious was thirsty so he asked for a drink of water and then for another and the prison guard was probably nervous and said youll get a pain in your belly from the water and he said the last thing im worried about is a pain in my belly im going to be dead in a few minutes
7395331 he had a handkerchief and a 100 000 rupiah note and he asked me to take those out of his pocket and give them to his wife
7395332 then he said father are you still there would you come forward and take off my shoes so i went forward and took off the shoes and he wanted his wife to get the shoes
7395333 after they were shot they were hurting they were moaning and it takes seven minutes to die the blood was coming out so then i tried singing a few hymns when they were dying so you could say its torture shooting people its torture
7395334 its torture its seven minutes to die so the heart is trying to pump the blood to the brain the brain is still alive and as long as theres blood getting to the brain the brain is not going to die
7395335 its sort of like when i would get arrested for shoplifting and there you are in a crowd in the holding cell

7395337 side of writng would be yankee crime writers of the 40s from whom i got my hardboiled delivery and cadence and the french writers and artists of the late 18th and early 19th century i have been obsessed and entranced with them for the last four years or so

7395339 no mortal man could possibly hope to stand up against the infinite might of nature
7395340 you ended the demon in your own mortal might why do always give up so easily
7395341 this is my destined fate i am to die into memory and my comrades will live on
7395342 choose your own destiny show the stars and the god above you have a little more fight left in you
7395343 i dont even know who i am trying to prove myself to
7395344 i am not one of those who seek the strong or the mighty i look only for those who have faith
7395345 you dont have to prove yourself to anyone my dear there are sometimes fights that cannot be won
7395346 then please my dear dont waste your life fighting pointless battles
7395347 the forces of life will always batter at you endless fighting will only ruin you
7395348 please my dear come to me and for once truly rest for so long you let your body waste away come to me and let the good god revive you
7395349 i have pulled you from the brink my child here you will be unharmed
7395350 i thank you for saving me but i am a damned sinner i quest for purity but make no progress i am evil
7395351 to me child there is no good there is no evil
7395352 i am the heavenly father to me you are all my children and i love you all the same
7395353 there is so much evil in the world yet you still hold love for it
7395354 yes my love for the earth and its inhabitants has not faltered if i was to abandon the earth i would have done so long ago
7395355 why not force the earth to do what is right
7395356 then i would be no better than the ones who commit the original evil
7395357 dont worry about earth or the humans i have quite the plan for it all
7395358 i once heard voices of a saint and of a demon what happened to them
7395359 those voices were manifests of what you feared to be and what you wished to be you feared to be something of evil and wished to be something of pure good
7395360 in the end all of the extensions of yourself whether they be desirable or not you will have to come to terms with who you are
7395361 i could never agree with who i am i am a monster and a demon nothing better
7395362 you poor thing of shame and self hate i have long watched the earth seeing true evils and sins committed you my child are just in time of confusion
7395363 you should end me now and let the world be better off
7395364 i know every thing about you from your hair to those shoes you never quite fasten
7395365 i couldnt let one of my own die what kind of father would i be

7395371 is this the paradise they speak of have i already died
7395372 sir it may not be in my place to inquire but why in such a small skiff did you come to this place and with so many great riches
7395373 i feel that is why your ship sank i saw it filled to very brim with gold and glittering gems
7395374 its odd to me how you didnt lose the load
7395375 i know i didnt bring anything with me and the ship itself i fell from it in the storm
7395376 god has blessed you not only with your life but also with great riches are you not happy
7395377 beyond all memory i dont think i have been any happier
7395378 i have none but i saw no claim staked on this bare and lifeless plot my apologies if this land is yours sir how can i make amends
7395379 before i saw a word of response to that you sir have terrible manners
7395380 give me your answer or make peace with your god
7395381 have you any idea who i am i am a hero who slew the demon from where i hail i am a legend
7395382 i care not and know not where you hail from as famous as you were in the lands where you hailed from it matters not in these lands

7395445 this musical is coming from the mind of dana marschz the teacher and he doesnt think its funny and hes not trying to be offensive
7395446 the joke of it is that hes so damaged and hes trying to be so honest with his feelings but hes so limited with his abilities that it ends up being completely inappropriate
7395447 hes the son of god and i think thats cool
7395448 so why do i feel like ive been raped in the face
7395449 it maybe came out of frustration because we had seen so many musicals and we were trying to do something that was really funny

7395454 the some were from the places that have a stereotype about fox but when i asked them if they ever actually watched fox the answer is almost never
7395455 my sense is that there is a recognition that we cant ignore or give the back of our hand to the largest audience in cable television news
7395456 they have nothing to do with a progressive point of view
7395457 i dont think you would find anybody in the progressive movement who would say yes they are spokesmen for what we believe in
7395458 is a disaster at standing up for democrats that must be why fox hired him

7395466 as an actor i think i can say for all of us who were there that we felt fortunate to get those locations and shoot at those places it really changes the performances to do it there at that spot
7395467 these guys are true american patriots they were fighting two wars
7395468 they were fighting the nazis the fascists in europe and fighting the japanese in the pacific and they were fighting jim crow racism prejudice in the united states of america at the same time
7395469 i love the idea of it it applied to where bond was at the end of the last movie
7395470 the one thing he didnt have with the relationship was that quantum of solace
7395471 its rare where you get a piece of material thats politically pertinent like this but also sort of non preachy and engaging entertainment for an audience
7395472 he doesnt want to be a monster he doesnt want to kill people
7395473 he loves her but if he gets too passionate he will want her blood he will want to kill her
7395474 doing those type of scenes is always a bit strange never mind a husband but an entire crew watching you
7395475 this was two lone wolves its a duel two complicated fascinating really brilliant people
7395476 for men with their histories their intelligence their egos a contest like this really did become kind of life and death

7395492 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7395493 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7395494 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7395495 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7395515 see all these women were killed with little regard and then brought back to life anyway it was all just done for shock value
7395516 but knee jerk ranting and raving is just so much more fun than actually you know knowing what youre talking about
7395517 because i love drama when it happens to other people
7395518 a collection and analysis of an enormous amount of data done by female renowned experts in the field using peer reviewed methods developed in concert with national academy of sciences and the american statistical associations committee on law and justice statistics which have been cited by virtually all the major anti rape organizations
7395519 as somebody said once about privileged groups trying to understand marginalized ones keep your mouth shut and your ears open
7395520 im saying that i have a higher opinion of women than you
7395521 im reminded of the book on conversational styles of men and women

7395523 en espa a es normal dar dinero para investigaciones que ya existen en el extranjero
7395524 the scope of rape incidence and prevalence of sexual aggression and victimization in a national sample of higher education
7395525 by callie m rennison of the bureau of justice statistics bjs which is what i was mainly looking at last time as you may recall the reason we were looking at it is because nenena said that 1 in 4 women would be raped in their lifetime and supported that statement by writing
7395526 criminal victimization 1999 changes 1998 00 with trends 1993 99
7395527 supported her theory you know before she read it she wrote
7395528 over the course of a college career which now lasts an average of 5 years the percentage of completed or attempted rape victimization among women in higher educational institutions between one eighth and one ninth
7395529 1 in 4 women are raped in their life time
7395530 80 of all females in superhero comics have been raped
7395531 a writer who writes a rape scene in a comic is a misogynist
7395532 well its mad thinker scott who says it so its automatically wrong
7395533 i believe fear mongers in the media have been playing women with misleading information to boost rating i think there are people who are clinging to the label of victim because they think it gives them power but theyve ignored that winning the fight also gives them power
7395534 btw its been quite a while since anyone has said that 80 of the women in comics have been raped i wonder why
7395535 this methodology change will fuck up your comparitive statistics for xxx reasons but this other methodology change does not render the comparison useless for yyy reasons
7395536 and thats the closest thing i can use to describe that whole drama pile kirk among the freaking out natives
7395537 oh you got me 80 is wrong i messed up
7395538 when scott comes around to saying that her arguments and others like them could conceivably undermine anti rape efforts by painting them as ineffective she tries to dismiss it with the incredulous
7395539 he uses statistics like a wino uses a lamppost for support not illumination
7395540 i followed the link read scotts post and you know how it looks to me it looks like someone letting a bit of snark loose indulging in some sarcasm probably out of a bit of frustration a far far cry from a meltdown
7395541 pot kettle i think it takes a hefty chunk of brass to swing phrases like psychotic around considering some of your own indulgences in snark
7395542 27 of college aged women reported having been raped in their lifetime
7395543 and somehow im still the idiot and you are smart one who isnt at all picking and chosing rules that fit her predetermined ideas

7395640 we have no reason to harbor any mistrust against our world for it is not against us if it has terrors they are our terrors if it has abysses these abysses belong to us if there are dangers we must try to love them and only if we could arrange our lives in accordance with the principle that tells us that we must always trust in the difficult then what now appears to us to be alien will become our most intimate and trusted experience how could we forget those ancient myths that stand at the beginning of all races the myths about the dragons that at the last moment are transformed into princesses perhaps all the dragons in our lives are only princesses waiting for us to act just once with beauty and courage perhaps everything that frightens us is in its deepest essence something helpless that wants our love so you must not be frightened if a sadness rises before you larger than any youve ever seen if an anxiety like light and cloud shadows moves over your hands and everything that you do you must realize that something has happened to you life has not forgotten you that it holds you in its hands and will not let you fall why do you want to shut out of your life any uneasiness any miseries or any depressions for after all you do not know what work these conditions are doing inside you

7395646 if you want to know whats true for you about something look to how youre feeling about it feelings are sometimes difficult to discover and often even more difficult to acknowledge yet hidden in your deepest feelings is your highest truth the trick is to get to those feelings i also communicate through thought thought and feelings are not the same although they can occur at the same time in communicating with thought i often use images and pictures for this reason thoughts are more effective than mere words as tools of communication in addition to feelings and thoughts i also use the vehicle of experience as a grand communicator and finally when feelings and thoughts and experience all fail i use words words are really the least effective communicator they are most open to misinterpretation most often misunderstood and why is that it is because of what words are words are merely utterances noises that stand for feelings thoughts and experience they are symbols signs insignias they are not the truth they are not the real thing words help you to understand something

7395668 sense of how conscious and open the bloggers are to feedback and criticism
7395669 i am open to the idea but as its not an issue of just the minister taking a stand it must be discussed with the attorney general
7395670 i welcome this proposal this is definitely something which should be looked into no one has the right to take someone elses life even if that person has taken another life
7395671 they cannot do that laws providing for such sentences still exist until we decide to do away with them

7395677 a the hse awareness is very poor in the plant
7395678 b most of employee feel it is troubled to follow up the safety rules that is because we have no the rewards and punishment rules in the plant
7395679 the fact that fewer travelers are booking online is not due to economic concerns online travel bookers are an affluent demographic it is caused by frustrations related to the planning and booking capabilities of online travel agencies
7395680 this in turn is spurring a renewed appreciation for the expertise and personalized services offered by traditional travel agents
7395681 not so long ago industry observers cast traditional travel agents as has beens
7395682 perhaps this has helped them to focus on what they do best provide travel expertise and personalized service
7395683 mired in old technology the otas have failed to keep pace with a newer and more innovative breed of travel websites built around user generated content
7395684 in addition a new breed of matchmaking travel sites is bringing traditional travel agency talent online
7395685 sites like tripology help travelers to exotic locales find travel agents tailored to their interests and needs
7395686 many of us have a strong desire to be big
7395687 to give our best every day to not hide out or be small many of us want to be big in order to bring our voice and add great value and to enable our coworkers and partners to do the same
7395688 while some of us may feel small because we lack self confidence certain management styles and workplace cultures contribute as well
7395689 in some organizations it can be dangerous to be big enough to stand out it can be dangerous to step out of the box you or others have put you in it can get you criticized it can get you ostracized it can get you fired
7395690 organizations need all of us to bring more of ourselves to the workplace
7395691 innovation problem solving and productivity depend upon us being big each person must contribute to collectively have a big impact on achieving the goals of the organization
7395692 each new point of view and set of skills adds t our capabilities our potential and our completeness collectively and individually if we are going to succeed over the long haul everybody needs to be willing to step up and step out together to be big and get smarter as we go
7395693 19 for the keywords list showing the same first five and asking for a subscription to see the rest no thank you i already have three months ago
7395694 whether youre sizing up a college campus thinking of joining a civic group or showing up on a new job first impressions set the tone for all that follows
7395695 the program for welcoming new shipmates consisted of the same old tired procedure that had been used since time out of mind we owed our people better than this
7395696 we wanted them to feel right at home not like strangers on a bad trip its clearly in your own best interest to recruit your people every day starting with day one and never stopping make sure your recruits get off on the right foot fired with enthusiasm and with the proper road map in hand
7395697 i discovered that leaders without humility are like apples without cores seedless and sterile nearly all organizations pulsing with life owe it to some empathetic leader given to looking not into the mirrors but into other peoples faces and feelings
7395698 the freedom to choose may be the most powerful attribute and precious resource you have in your life it shapes who you become how you express yourself the success you achieve and the influence you have in your world
7395699 by rationalizing that you have no choice you are choosing not to recognize legitimate alternatives that are yours for the taking you are stuck in a comfort zone of inaction that is functional and safe but leaves you dead and disengaged your choice comes with an unhealthy price tag one that could cost you more than the price you wouldve paid for constructive confrontation or moving on
7395700 if you accept our call to arms and join this revolution at least three things will happen you will expand your influence you will become a positive force for change and you will live with fewer regrets
7395701 accept the fact that no one is going to ride in on a white horse and rescue you or your organization no one is going to magically lift the weight of responsibility from your shoulders dont wait for others to show you the way blaze the trail yourself
7395702 the hell of it is youre only going to be loved if youre lovable if you are you get it back in spades the truth is you always get back more than you give away some people never learn that
7395703 the most important thing about you today is not where youve been its where you are going
7395704 engagement increases when you lean into your strengths not your weaknesses
7395705 you cant innovate without experimenting you cant experiment without making mistakes and you cant make mistakes unless youre willing to risk failure and rejection
7395706 its dark its going to rain what are you an idiot
7395707 ive pedalled all the way here im only halfway through my regular route i cant turn back now
7395708 were all susceptible to the sway of irrational behaviours but the better understanding the seductive pull of these forces well be less likely to fall victim to them in the future
7395709 we experience the pain associated with a loss much more vividly than we do the joy of experiencing a gain
7395710 now neither one wants to be the sucker who paid good money for nothing
7395711 they become committed to the strategy of playing not to lose
7395712 regardless of who the bidders have been they are always swayed the deeper the hole they dig themselves into the more they continue to dig
7395713 youve got a very limited time exposure applicants put on their best show managers put on their best show and not surprisingly you just dont see the realities of the person in 20 minutes
7395714 the idea is to focus on relevant data and squelch any questions that invite the candidate to predict the future reconstruct the past or ponder lifes big questions
7395715 the need to create a structure of belonging grows out of the isolated nature of our lives our institutions and our communities
7395716 the absence of belonging is so widespread that we might say we are living in an age of isolation
7395717 it lets citizens off the hook and breeds citizen dependency and entitlement
7395718 it undermines a culture where each is accountable for their community
7395719 leadership begins with understanding that every gathering is an opportunity to deepen accountability and commitment through engagement
7395720 questions are more transformative than answers and are the essential tools of engagement questions create the space for something new to emerge
7395721 while visions plans and committed top leadership are important even essential no clear vision nor detailed plan nor committed group of leaders have the power to bring this image of the future into existence without the continued engagement and involvement of citizens
7395722 the world does not need leaders to better define issues or to orchestrate better planning or project management what it needs is for the issues and the plans to have more of an impact and that comes from citizenship accountability and commitment
7395723 something almost mystical certainly mysterious occurs when citizens sit in a small group for they often become more authentic and personal with each other than in other settings

7395757 pochi scrittori italiani scrivono di calcio perch pochi lo hanno giocato da piccoli evidentemente
7395758 pasolini giocava e ne ha scritto per altri scrittori alla baricco il calcio diventato anche strumento promozionale una bella vetrina in cui si inventano partite tra artisti tra scrittori di destra e di sinistra

7395771 forse ho esagerato con la percentuale del 95 per cento di successo dellitalia in effetti sia il brasile che altre avversarie sono fortissime quindi le probabilit scendono ma mica di molto sapete mi sento ottimista come mai forse mi era capitato e non voglio nasconderlo
7395772 nono sono diventato subito portiere anzi avevo iniziato la mia carriera in avanti un po di voglia di giocare con i piedi mi rimasta questo forse uno dei motivi per cui mi sfogo con il subbuteo nei panni di difensore centrocampista e attaccante anche se devo ammetterlo mi esalto quando compio interventi miracolosi con il mio portiere in miniatura
7395773 il mio idolo era lothar matthaeus mi piaceva il modo di giocare e il personaggio al di fuori degli schemi come squadra mi entusiasmava il pescara di galeone formazione imprevedibile magari un po incostante ma capace di imprese ritenute difficilissime e i portieri thomas nkono scavezzacollo istrionico spettacolare ma anche efficace
7395774 ultimamente ci sono voci che corrono sulla presunta omosessualit di alcuni giocatori non capisco il problema se giocano bene a calcio a me basta credo che quelli che si scandalizzano dovrebbero consultare uno specialista per evitare di drammatizzare
7395775 a volte la mia nonna non esita a dirmene quattro sul modo in cui gioco e persino a spiegarmi come fare un tackle perfetto
7395776 dio mi ha sempre assistito nella mia carriera e naturalmente lo speciale dalla parte del chelsea mi sembra che sia stato mourinho ad averlo definito cos per scherzare trovo che sia un nome indovinato
7395777 non conosco un altro paese al mondo che possa contare su attaccanti dalla forma cos smagliante penso che potrebbero scendere in campo tutti insieme

7395791 qui ci sono due galattici come ruud van nilsterooy uno degli attaccanti pi prolifici e wayne rooney il talento su cui punta eriksson per i mondiali di germania non dimenticherei i senatori come paul scholes e ryan giggs con la primavera si allena il diciannovenne giuseppe rossi che ha gi segnato in premier league un paio di reti nelle movenze ricorda paolo rossi il talento non gli manca e in prospettiva ferguson punta molto su di lui il giocatore pi amato dai tifosi per resta eric cantona ancora oggi lo inneggiano durante le partite purtroppo non lho allenato

7395925 rife with paradoxes it is fueled by a determination to bring publicity to the closed repressive arab political world shattering every taboo and crossing every red line with abandon at the same time its politics of identity could all too easily slide into a tyranny from below excommunicating those who disagree and demonizing outsiders to enforce internal unity
7395926 characterized by self conscious open and contentious political argument before a vast but discrete audience

7395938 over here she wouldnt wear it the chinese wont wear ethnic costume to a party theyll wear dior
7395939 if anything if they want to be a success here they have to present a contemporary western look it is almost as though they have to go overseas make their name and then come back as say a designer that is what has happened to shanghai tang
7395940 has lost its cultural heritage over the past 50 years
7395941 after the communists took over we have not had much to shout about in the way of chinese culture if anything the young chinese designers need to take some time to re learn what has been lost
7395942 but one of the other reasons there are no chinese mens wear designers is that they cant compete with the tailors i get my suits tailor made for s 700 800 which is about 250 and my shirts for s 70 about 25 how are you going to compete with that thats what you get when you can literally throw humanity at something
7395943 i wont go shopping on a saturday in any more because the shops are so full of those who have travelled from the mainland they save up and then make two or three trips a year especially to go spending at places like louis vuitton and gucci
7395944 they dont really understand the concept of a brand the chinese are a nation of traders they look to the short term theyre not yet willing to invest the money or the time and effort it takes to build a brand they want a quick return and their outlook is local

7395973 it took a while and some experimenting by various neighbourhoods and cities to see you know whether this was valid or not
7395974 i went to a lecture a summer or two ago and i found myself going like this
7395975 and halfway through it i looked around and half the audience was going like this
7395976 and i thought to myself its time for the ear trumpet to come back
7395977 no i havent long felt that im not an academic myself but im not against it
7395978 but i am upset by this notion of how much credentialism has taken over and i believe an awful lot of faculty members are upset about it too
7395979 there are certain places that had beautiful old homes in them but theyve been abandoned now a lot of those areas are being rediscovered and brought back but why did they get abandoned and derelict in the first place they bored people the heirs of the people who built those houses didnt value them a place thats been extremely gentrified is a bore
7395980 about the only things that can pay those rents are restaurants it has far too many restaurants and far too few of the other things it used to be interesting
7395981 one thing that astonishes me always is how stupid chambers of commerce and boards of trade are about whats good for them
7395982 long ago as a child i read a story thats always stuck with me about the man who sold the sun for a guinea
7395983 actually and this is something that i never recognised until i left the us people in america dont think that any other place is totally real compared with america
7395984 people were calling me up saying when are you coming back id say im not coming back oh well how can you leave the place where things happen id say things happen there too just as real its very hard to get this across to americans and i dont think americans can appreciate this until theyve lived outside the country for a little while
7395985 im happy im still able to work all night long if i have to but i cant work two nights in succession anymore
7395986 well there are other cities that i like very much
7395987 every one of the cities is so much a part of the culture as a whole that i dont think you can separate them out and think of them as islands that will either survive or wont there are no islands in dark ages
7395988 yeah in the sense that failing to do the right thing has consequences i think i know what the right thing is and what cant be ignored if i were in doubt i wouldnt write it
7395989 jammer maar er winnen er zo veel niet dan ben je geen verliezer dan heb je gewoon niks gewonnen
7395990 even if the power of a new international public sphere is growing it is not at all clear that it is a liberal public sphere the politics of the new arab public sphere tend towards populism the politics of identity of authenticity and of resistance
7395991 is the new open arab public sphere really paving the road to a liberal pluralist politics as the author seems to imply the answer is simply no
7395992 whether the arab public sphere develops in a liberal direction or in a populist direction consumed by questions of identity and authenticity is one of the most pivotal questions shaping the arab future

7396005 a wall of ice coming towards us and then we were carried 200 metres
7396006 i was not completely submerged i managed to help the others
7396007 its probable according to statements made to us that the climbers roped together were on the path up the mountain and in the place where the block of ice tumbled down
7396008 plus we have to remember that freud included much more than intercourse in the term sex

7396014 this is not a time when businesses are feeling very confident
7396015 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country
7396016 the privilege of being reminded just how decent people are
7396017 things will be gradually getting out of here after midnight
7396018 then were looking for a very dry remainder of the week
7396019 i get pain in the back if i stand too long i need to sit down to relieve some of the pain
7396020 they raced to their own judgment at the same time mr arroyos life was affected by what happened
7396021 no what you do is just stand out there and just flex
7396022 i did it to encourage myself there was times i couldnt get up i had to strengthen my core my body
7396023 we have nothing against the technology we just dont want that delivery system
7396024 he wants to come to the dnc but its not a must do like at the capitol
7396025 there his vote counted and he really had to be there
7396026 sen kennedy is humbled by the tribute planned tonight and he looks forward to watching sen obama accept the democratic nomination for president
7396027 hes the heart and soul of our party and hes inseparable from our fighting faith
7396028 you have to understand our party grew up with ted we were inspired by the way he carried on for his brothers and built a legacy as the greatest senator of all time
7396029 there hasnt been a single significant policy accomplishment over four decades without teds fingerprints and no one appreciates that more than the party faithful going to denver
7396030 the drama would be such that i wouldnt be shocked to see him there
7396031 i think if he gets up in the morning and feels ok i wouldnt be surprised if he came
7396032 its a problem given that were probably heading into a recession and weve been borrowing extensively
7396033 this trend is very troubling given the huge economic uncertainties
7396034 this is the time we should at least hold the payroll constant
7396035 the doc is a 24 7 public safety operation with staffing requirements
7396036 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7396037 i have worked within the confines of hollywood and rarely get the opportunity to branch out and this was one of those opportunities i got to try something that was of the european mind
7396038 my own view is if you are putting money into sport it should be put into the primary schools as you need a big pool to choose from
7396039 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7396040 this could give you an almost infinite number of switches and options for communication
7396041 its easy and somebody could learn an entirely different language
7396042 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage
7396043 if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7396044 mr roche is not calling for a second referendum to be put that would not be a fair reflection the government is instead following the steps it said it would take in the wake of the referendum outcome
7396045 we now need to take a hard look at our situation within the eu
7396046 we have to recognise however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year this will leave ireland in an isolated position
7396047 in the view of the other member states we will be preventing the eu from equipping itself to deal with the many political and economic challenges facing todays europe
7396048 not an inch is not a policy that has much to commend it in a dynamic europe that wants to move forward
7396049 we have to explore all possible solutions we cannot exclude the possibility that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people once again my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage
7396050 it was a hard struggle for his family who covered almost every cost of his preparation for the olympics his community from north belfast also put their hands in their pockets to raise funds to help paddy

7396093 although there is no known laugh center in the brain its neural mechanism has been the subject of much albeit inconclusive speculation it is evident that its expression depends on neural paths arising in close association with the telencephalic and diencephalic centers concerned with respiration wilson considered the mechanism to be in the region of the mesial thalamus hypothalamus and subthalamus kelly and co workers in turn postulated that the tegmentum near the periaqueductal grey contains the integrating mechanism for emotional expression thus supranuclear pathways including those from the limbic system that papez hypothesised to mediate emotional expressions such as laughter probably come into synaptic relation in the reticular core of the brain stem so while purely emotional responses such as laughter are mediated by subcortical structures especially the hypothalamus and are stereotyped the cerebral cortex can modulate or suppress them
7396094 laughter is a mechanism everyone has laughter is part of universal human vocabulary there are thousands of languages hundreds of thousands of dialects but everyone speaks laughter in pretty much the same way
7396095 even apes have a form of pant pant pant laughter
7396096 until they met each other neither of these exceptionally happy ladies had known anyone who laughed as much as she did
7396097 inherited some aspects of their laugh sound and pattern readiness to laugh and perhaps even taste in humor
7396098 the physical and psychological benefits of laughter come second only to the physical and psychological benefits of sex

7396128 i thought i would sign in for a progress report
7396129 i had colitis problems since 2 years of age chronic constipation was a problem for 30 years as an adult i was diagnosed as having crohns colitis disease three years ago when the constipation changed to diarrhea after a few months on your diet i am now free of all symptoms and i discontinued my drug my recent colonoscopy showed a perfectly normal colon my doctor was amazed the arthritis in my hands had been causing stiffness and pain it was getting worse each year but has completely disappeared i can knit again
7396130 i have been following your diet for a couple of months i eat mostly moose meat with coconut fat i had a colonoscopy three days ago and guess what no inflammation my colon looked so good my doctor said the previous inflammation could not have been from a flare yeah right i know it was a bad flare but i am fine now your page was the first site to open my eyes to the dangers of eating carbs keep up the good work
7396131 just wanted to give you another update my asthma is all gone im eating 4 lbs of red meat every day and im growing like a weed shredding fat adding muscle and being healthy is the best thing that has ever happened to me
7396132 thanks for your information its been very helpful ive taken your advice and ive eliminated many of the offending foods that were allowed on another type of ibd diet that i thought were alright that diet includes yogurt melon goats cheese and surprisingly the most helpful of all carrots ive gone almost a year thinking that i couldnt tolerate butter and fatty meat and suddenly they cause me no problem i was having a flare for three weeks and just beginning with the principals of your diet not including the supplements and minerals has gotten me back to normality in less than a week its a wonder
7396133 the recommended dosage of diflucan for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day followed by 100 mg once daily doses up to 400 mg day may be used based on medical judgment of the patients response to therapy patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least two weeks following resolution of symptoms
7396134 for systemic candida infections including candidemia disseminated candidiasis and pneumonia optimal therapeutic dosage and duration of therapy have not been established in open noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients doses of up to 400 mg daily have been used
7396135 inflammatory bowel disease is the term used for both crohns disease and ulcerative colitis these conditions may be associated with malnutrition because of such factors as poor appetite decreased absorption surgical loss of bowel intestinal injury and chronic diarrhea patients commonly experience weight loss vitamin and trace element deficiency may also occur if the disorder occurs during childhood growth failure due to malnutrition must be treated before the potential for normal growth is lost
7396136 diet cant cure inflammatory bowel disease avoiding certain foods however may help to control symptoms foods to avoid include dairy foods high in lactose such as milk and soft cheeses in patients who are lactose intolerant raw fruits and vegetables spicy foods and nuts
7396137 the clinical activity of any one of these four halogens is in inverse proportion to its atomic weight this means that any one of the four can displace the element with a higher atomic weight but cannot displace an element with a lower atomic weight for example flourine can displace chlorine bromine and iodine because flourine has a lower atomic weight than the other three similarly chlorine can displace bromine and iodine because they both have a higher atomic weight likewise bromine can displace iodine from the body because iodine has a higher atomic weight but a reverse order is not possible a knowledge of this well known chemical law brings us to a consideration of the addition of chlorine to our drinking water as a purifying agent we secure a drinking water that is harmful to the body not because of its harmful germ content but because the chlorine content now causes the body to lose the much needed iodine
7396138 supposing you do follow the suggestions outlined above and find that some weeks the pressures of your private and your business life are causing you to lose the ability to bounce back then you should add a drop of lugols solution of iodine to your glass of apple or grape juice at breakfast or you may take it in the mixture of apple cider vinegar and water the point is that the potassium in the solution blocks off the body mechanism that organizes for aggressive action releasing its hold on the body when opportunity for rest and relaxation arises the iodine swings into action the body and the building up and storing of body reserves when working under pressure include the lugols solution dose each day until the period of pressure passes if it should happen that your body becomes saturated with iodine you will find that there is an increase of moisture in the nose if this occurs omit the iodine until the nose is normal
7396139 inflammatory bowel disease is the term used for both crohns disease and ulcerative colitis these conditions may be associated with malnutrition because of such factors as poor appetite decreased absorption surgical loss of bowel intestinal injury and chronic diarrhea patients commonly experience weight loss vitamin and trace element deficiency may also occur if the disorder occurs during childhood growth failure due to malnutrition must be treated before the potential for normal growth is lost

7396141 specialized predigested liquid diets elemental diets combined with the exclusion of other food may induce remission in some patients recent data suggest less highly predigested polymeric diets may work as well as elemental diets preliminary studies have examined the benefits of using fish oils to relieve the symptoms of ulcerative colitis or prolong remission in crohns disease
7396142 celiac disease is believed to be hereditary and is most common among people of northern european descent as many as one in every 250 americans may have celiac disease but most cases go undiagnosed often because the symptoms are assumed to be caused by other diseases or because symptoms are mild although many cases are diagnosed in childhood celiac disease can be diagnosed at any age it is believed that surgery pregnancy childbirth viral infection or severe emotional stress can trigger symptoms of the disease in people who are predisposed genetically
7396143 celiac disease is considered to be an autoimmune condition because the bodys own immune system damages the intestinal villi even though the process is started by eating gluten people with celiac disease also tend to have an increased risk of developing other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes which usually requires insulin and is most common in children and young adults systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis and thyroid disease other conditions that may coexist with celiac disease include dermatitis herpetiformis an itchy blistering skin rash liver disease and immune system abnormalities
7396144 new research shows that some people with no obvious symptoms of the digestive disorder celiac disease can in fact have the condition a survey of more than 4 000 people with no genetic risk factors or symptoms of celiac disease revealed that about 1 in 130 had the disorder over time celiac disease can damage the small intestine and interfere with the normal absorption of nutrients from food the only treatment for the illness is a diet that strictly avoids foods that contain gluten a protein found in wheat rye and barley
7396145 no one knows for sure what triggers the inflammation in ulcerative colitis many people think that it begins with a virus or a bacterial infection and that the bodys immune system malfunctions and stays active after the infection has cleared in this kind of autoimmune problem the bowel is injured by the bodys immune system the disease does not act contagious even within families so there is no worry of direct spread of the disease from one person to another
7396146 ulcerative colitis affects the inner lining of the rectum and adjoining colon causing it to wear away in spots leaving ulcers to bleed or to ooze cloudy mucus or pus a few other parts of the body seem to be affected by inflammation and can develop symptoms in ulcerative colitis including the eyes skin liver back and joints
7396147 no one knows for sure what triggers the intestinal inflammation
7396148 once crohns disease begins it can cause intermittent lifelong symptoms by inflaming the inside lining and deeper layers of the intestine wall the irritated intestine lining can thicken or wear away in spots creating ulcers or in cracks creating fissures inflammation can also allow an abscess a pocket of pus to develop in between attacks of inflammation the intestine attempts to heal by recoating itself with a new inside lining when the inflammation has been severe the intestine can lose its ability to distinguish the inside of one piece of intestine from the outside of another piece as a result it can mistakenly build a lining along the edges of an ulcer that has worn through the whole wall of the gut creating a fistula a permanent tunnel between one piece of gut and another a fistula can sometimes even form between the gut and the skin surface creating drainage of mucous to the skin
7396149 helicobacter pylori proved to be the cause of most stomach ulcers has also been linked with stomach cancer in a study of 550 people who had stomach cancer surgery antibiotics which killed the bug cut the risk of a second cancer developing by two thirds
7396150 even low doses of mastic gum 1 g per day for two weeks can cure peptic ulcers very rapidly but the mechanism responsible has not been clear we have found that mastic is active against helicobacter pylori which could explain its therapeutic effect in patients with peptic ulcers
7396151 mastic is a resinous exudate obtained from the stem and the main leaves of pistacia lentiscus it is used as a food ingredient in the mediterranean region clinically mastic has been effective in the treatment of benign gastric ulcers 1 and duodenal ulcers 2 in rats mastic showed cytoprotective and mild antisecretory properties 3 we assessed the antibacterial properties of mastic against h pylori

7396154 it is apparent that there is no single artificial tear eye drop that provides all of the surface healing strategies bicarbonate ions hypotonicity viscosity non preserved therefore perhaps it may be beneficial to use different eyedrops interchangeably or sequentially i e a drop of systane or refresh liquigel followed 5 minutes later by a drop of bion tears murine tears has the preservative bac therefore avoid it followed 5 minutes later by a drop of thera tears or thera tears liquid gel hypo tears and akwa tears has bac therefore avoid them this cycle may be repeated every 2 to 4 hours at night use a non preserved ointment like refresh pm ointment avoid lacrilube as it has preservative chlorbutanol

7396174 on june 23 we thought katie had a hernia and we were scared to death that that was what it was because she had a staph infection when she was much younger antibiotics couldnt control it so any kind of surgery would be a big deal for her because if that infection became inflamed and spread it could be deadly we were very terrified that she was going to need surgery to have the hernia removed
7396175 the doctor told us he believed it was cancerous tumor in her liver this was nothing that we were prepared for mama was shaking scared to death all we could do was pray and cry and have faith that everything would be alright he sent us immediately to the childrens hospital at the medical university of south carolina for a biopsy at that point there was still a chance the tumor was benign
7396176 the tumor was too large to be removed so they immediately began chemotherapy to shrink it because shes on antibiotics and needs the chemotherapy a port was inserted in her chest for the chemo
7396177 she calls the port a cath bob and the pole that holds the bag of medicine fred it makes it familiar and easier for her to talk to us shell tell us bob hurts or can you move fred
7396178 its very scary but we have a lot of faith that shell be ok

7396208 papa was twenty five mamma was nineteen when they were married papa told us children that after paying the preacher 50 cents which was a big fee he only had 7 cents left he rented a farm as a share cropper papas father and his oldest brother were killed by lightning papa was three years old at the time it was in the afternoon his father had just opened the front door in the house after a rainstorm the thunder and lightning were very heavy my grandmother was ill she was lying on the bed papa said he remember that he was sitting on the foot of his mothers bed when my grandfather went to the back door opened it to get some breeze and draft thought the house
7396209 grandma said she made bed mattresses with cornhusk and grass stuffed in burlap bags sewn together
7396210 some things are so vivid in my mind one day all we children were sitting around grandma forehand lydia copeland just before her youngest daughter aunt georgia was married
7396211 well i dont see any reason why two girls should be punished in the same dress
7396212 if you turn him on his back how many legs would have have
7396213 our wonderful little grandma forehand with her loving arms was never too busy to give us a great big hug including my father joseph jordan i remember as we jumped out of the surrey at her house we would see who could get to her first for a hug and a kiss and many more before the sunday was over grandma would sit down on a bench or swing in the yard to be sure none of us missed that hug and kiss with seven children rushing at her i bet she thought it was better sitting besides they had other grandchildren there every sunday when we left for home she would stand at the road gate and wave to us until our surry went around the bend of the road out of sight
7396214 i so wish i could had an adult mind and heart
7396215 we children always looked forward to the sunday that we were going to visit grandma and grandpa forehand they were quakers they came to this country from england in the 16th century and many of them settled in a part of north carolina called the piney woods the name came from that part because there were so many blueberries it was named piney woods my mother and her six sisters picked blueberries while my grandfather hauled them to norfolk virginia it was forty or fifty miles on a dirt road it took four days for the round trip they had another laod ready when he got back he never gave anyone a dime he died with his trunk keys in his hand in 1906 no one knew how much money was in that trunk two of his daughters were sitting by his bedside when he died they took most of the money it was alleged that they put it in the bank in edenton north carolina about fifteen miles away the bank failed though and they lost all the money some said it was about eight thousand there was only three hundred in grandpas trunk
7396216 my grandma had about the most wonderful place in the world not because it was grandma but because it was real old and antique grandfather built it house barns and all the other buildings were log cabins grandma made all the things for living and grandpa made all the furniture and plenty of it they had six daughters one boy died with typhoid fever grandpa built all those buildings also a corn crib a smoke house and a house for his weaving and spinning machines for wool and cotton also made the family clothes of cotton and wool dyed all the cotton and wool all around that house were nice shade trees fruit trees and grape vines there was an old split rail fence all around the place all kinds of herbs and shrubs the house and barn were on about a two acre lots that was mostly sand they always had two nice dogs geese chickens ducks hogs two cows sheep and two large belgium draft horses there were nice swings under the trees it was like heaven on earth there papa would hitch our two pretty black horses to the surrey every sunday morning and we would go the church then to grandmas sometimes we didnt get to church if there was a special occasion at grandmas
7396217 about six am papa leon and i hitched the horses to our pretty surrey
7396218 come right in this house i got something good for you
7396219 my grandpa would take papa out and they would have a nice glass of cold cider that was put down the well to get it cold all the children would pile around grandma and aunt nan aunt priscilla aunt mattie and aunt georgie they would all be there on sunday too with all their children what a dinner table there was about thirty feet long and built to the floor with long benches on each side there were no chairs except one at each end they were for grandma and grandpa when we all got seated at the table grandpa would stand and ask a blessing poor grandma had a large fan it was large and it hung down a long was from the ceiling it would fan that table from one end to the other heavy hot food in august we children didnt reach we asked if one did reach he or she was sent from the table and had no dinner
7396220 in cool weather grandma would go out and get the black walnuts and crack them with us to make candy
7396221 we would leave there about 5 00pm go home change clothes and start feeding for the night
7396222 i can remember my grandpa when i could barely walk he would take my on his arm and go out in the grapevine and pop grapes in my mouth i remember the day he died from a stroke we went to the funeral i was only six years old i was put in a room to sleep they had the funeral at the house i was trying to peek under the door and fell asleep right there on the floor
7396223 at the grave in the woods i was sitting in the buggy and it was raining very gently and everybody was crying there was an old woman there about seven feet tall standing in her door with a snuff brush in her mouth and wearing a black bonnet her house was about fifty feet from the family grave yard
7396224 beginning of the civil war 1861 grandpa forehand was twenty one years old and just married
7396225 one day my grandmother baked some pies to take to the camp

7396235 untuk aku untuk teman temanku untuk saudara dan saudariku kehidupan di akhirat adalah yang abadi janganlah tinggalkan sholat atau menundanya apalagi jikalau engkau gadaikan hanya karena engkau takut tidak kebagian segunung emas padahal engkau tahu siapa sebaik baiknya pemberi rejeki janganlah bersikap pintar tetapi sebenarnya bodoh janganlah sering menipu diri sendiri siapa tau besok adalah giliran kita yang dipanggil oleh nya ya tuhan ampuni kami
7396236 ya tuhan semoga aku tidak termasuk hamba mu yang lebih mencintai harta daripada mu maafkanlah aku yang sering menunda sholatku padahal aku tahu aku hidup untuk matiku matiku adalah bertemu dengan mu matiku dan nantinya adalah kehidupanku yang abadi sekiranya aku pintar tapi aku bodoh

7396238 gate dari bahasa inggris gerbang pagar dimana saat disc membuka keatas maka seluruh aliran akan bebas masuk tanpa hambatan yang berarti namun pada saat disc tertutup rapat maka aliran akan berhenti tertahan oleh disc tersebut 2 globe valve globe valve merupakan salah satu jenis valve yang dirancang untuk mengatur besar kecilnya aliran fluida regulate atau trotthling pada dasarnya bagian utama dari globe valve ini sama saja dengan gate valve yaitu terdiri dari body seat disc bonnet stem packing dan gland globe valve dengan gate valve bentuknya hampir sama tetapi ada ciri ciri tertentu yang dapat di jadikan acuan untuk membedakan antara keduanya yaitu i pada bagian dalam valve disc dan seat nya berbeda perbedaan disc dan seat ini menyebabkan terjadi profil pola aliran yang berbeda bentuk dari disc dan seat inilah yang menyebabkan globe valve dapat diandalkan sebagai throttling valve aliran fluida saat melewati globe valve akan mengalami sedikit hambatan sehingga akan terjadi pressure drop yang lebih besar dari gate valve pertama aliran akan mengenai seat lalu membelok keatas melewati dan mengenai seluruh bagian disc lalu aliran akan dibelokkan lagi ke arah yang sama ii pada bagian luar body dari globe valve terlihat lebih menggelembung khusus untuk globe valve yang menangani fluida steam maka biasanya valve akan dilengkapi dengan back seat yang terletak berhadapan dengan seat back seat ini berperan sebagai pelapis pelindung bagian atas globe valve mencegah steam untuk menerobos masuk beberapa contoh valve tetapi masih termasuk dalam jenis globe valve i angle valve termasuk jenis globe valve digunakan untuk mengubah aliran sebesar 90 derajat valve ini bisa digunakan juga sebagai pengganti elbow contoh gambar angle valve ii needle valve termasuk jenis globe valve digunakan untuk mengatur secara lebih akurat aliran yang pressure rendah bentuk disc nya panjang dan kecil seperti paku dikatakan rotation valve karena valve membuka dan menutup dengan cara rotasi pada disc valve valve dibawah ini berbeda dengan gate valve dan globe valve dalam hal cara membuka dan menutup valve pada gate valve dan globe valve kita diharuskan memutar handwell namun untuk rotation valve kita bisa membuka dan munutup valve hanya dengan memutar handle valve sebesar 90 derajat oleh karena itu valve jenis ini bisa membuka dan menutup lebih cepat dari gate valve ataupun globe valve handle pada valve tipe ini adalah pengganti handwell pada gate valve dan globe valve hal penting yang harus diperhatikan adalah pada posisi valve fully open maka handle akan searah dengan aliran atau pipa namun jika posisi valve fully close maka posisi handle tidak searah dengan aliran atau pipa melainkan akan membentuk sudut 90 derajat dengan aliran atau pipa yang termasuk jenis ini adalah plug valve ball valve dan butterfly valve i plug valve secara umum kegunaan dari plug valve adalah untuk fully open dan fully close isolation atau on off control bagian bagian utama plug valve sama saja dengan gate valve ataupun globe valve yaitu body stem packing bolt seal plug seal sama fungsinya dengan packing packing bolt sama fungsinya dengan gland nut atau gland sedangkan plug sama fungsinya dengan disc tapi bentuknya berbeda plug ini digunakan untuk mengontrol membuka dan menutup aliran pada plug valve plug mempunyai celah atau lubang tempat aliran lewat saat handle diputar menuju open position maka plug akan berputar secara rotasi terhadap seat dan bagian yang bercelah akan melewatkan aliran namun pada saat handle diputar pada close position maka plug akan berputar secara rotasi terhadap seat dan bagian yang tak bercelah akan menahan aliran sehingga aliran pun akan berhenti plug harus rapat dengan body agar tidak terjadi kebocoran leaking atau passing antara plug dan body akan terjadi gesekan friction maka untuk menimalkan efek gesekan tersebut pada daerah sentuhan plug dan body diberikan pelumas karena itu ada type plug valve yang mempunyai tempat pengisian pelumas diatas stem ada juga yang sudah diberikan pelumas dari pabrik pembuatnya ada juga yang yang tidak membutuhkan pelumas namun pada daerah sentuhan sudah dilapisi material teflon jenis ini dinamakan self lubricating jenis jenis valve yang lain yang masih termasuk plug valve adalah yaitu jenis plug valve yang mempunyai 3 port sambungan 1 untuk inlet dan 2 untuk outlet dengan menggunakan valve ini maka dengan mudah kita dapat mengarahkan outlet kearah aliran pipa yang dikehendaki b four way plug valve biasa digunakan pada fluida cooling water yang melewati heat exchanger dimana aliran cooling water bisa dengan mudah dibalikkan arahnya dengan tujuan untuk membersihkan heat exchanger tersebut dari kotoran kotoran fouling sediment solids ii ball valve secara sederhana ball valve sama saja dengan plug valve tetapi bentuk disc nya berbeda dinamakan ball valve karena bentuk disc nya ini bulat seperti bola dan bentuk body nya silinder ball valve digunakan juga sebagai on off valve fully opened atau fully closed valve dan handal untuk aliran fluida yang mengandung partikel partkel solid slurry sama seperti plug valve ball valve juga membuka dan menutup dengan cara rotasi pada disc sehingga dapat membuka dan menutup lebih cepat ball valve juga mempunyai handle yang sama dengan plug valve dimana pada posisi valve fully open maka handle akan searah dengan aliran atau pipa namun jika posisi valve fully close maka posisi handle tidak searah dengan aliran atau pipa melainkan akan membentuk sudut 90 derajat dengan aliran atau pipa butterfly valve digunakan untuk mengontrol trhottling regulate valve aliran fluida yang bertekanan rendah bagian bagian utama pada valve ini sama saja dengan valve valve yang diatas yaitu body disc seat dan handle disc nya berbentuk piringan yang tipis seat nya melingkar mengikuti bentuk disc handle nya berbeda dengan type plug valve dan ball valve karena mempunyai lever yang harus kita tekan apabila ingin membuka dan menutup valve dan kita lepaskan apabila telah sampai ke posisi yang kita inginkan lever inilah yang akan membantu disc untuk mengunci rapat ibagian bawah handle dan lever terdapat skala scale yang digunakan untuk pembacaan posisi valve opening atau valve closing butterfly valve juga membuka dan menutup dengan cara rotasi pada disc sehingga dapat membuka dan menutup lebih cepat dan mempunyai handle yang sama dengan plug valve dimana pada posisi valve fully open maka handle akan searah dengan aliran atau pipa namun jika posisi valve fully close maka posisi handle tidak searah dengan aliran atau pipa melainkan akan membentuk sudut 90 derajat dengan aliran atau pipa diaphgram valve bisa digunakan untuk mengatur aliran trhottling dan bisa juga digunakan sebagai on off valve diaphgram valve handal dalam penanganan material kasar seperti fluida yang mengandung pasir semen atau lumpur serta fluida yang mempunyai sifat korosif diaphgram valve mudah dikenali karena bentuk bonnet nya yang menggembung seperti lonceng diaphgram valve mempunyai stem handwell plunger dan diaphgram stud yang menjadi satu diaphgram seat dan body diaphgram valve tidak mempunyai disc tetapi sebagai pengganti disc adalah diaphgram itu sendiri dimana valve ini akan menutup jika plunger menekan diaphgram dan akan terbuka jika plunger naik keatas saat menutup valve ini juga tidak boleh terlalu kencang karena bisa merusak diaphgram 5 pinch valve pinch valve digunakan untuk menangani fluida yang berlumpur endapan dan yang mempunyai partikel partikel solid yang banyak serta fluida fluida yang mempunyai kecenderungan untuk terjadi kebocoran leak 6 check valve check valve digunakan untuk membuat aliran fluida hanya mengalir kesatu arah saja atau agar tidak terjadi reversed flow back flow bentuk check valve sama saja dengan gate valve tapi valve ini tidak mempunyai handwell handle maupun stem secara umum ada 3 macam check valve yang cara kerjanya sama saja namun aplikasi nya terhadap material fluida yang berbeda yaitu swing check valve lift check valve dan ball check valve swing check valve penggunaan untuk fluida gas ataupun liquid yang tidak mengandung partikel padat solid lift check valve penggunaan untuk fluida steam gas maupun liquid yang mempunyai flow yang tinggi ball check valve penggunaan untuk fluida liquid yang mengandung partikel padatan kedua valve ini digunakan untuk melepaskan release tekanan pressure pada suatu sistem agar tidak membahayakan alat equipment personnel yang sedang bekerja dan untuk kepentingan proses itu sendiri antara kedua valve ini terdapat penggunaan istilah yang seringkali tertukar satu sama lain kadang relieve valve dianggap safety valve dan kadang juga safety valve dianggap relieve valve namun sebenarnya perbedaan mendasarnya adalah cara kerjanya itu sendiri relieve valve akan membuka perlahan lahan apabila terjadi kelebihan excess pressure dan akan menutup kembali apabila pressure telah kembali normal relieve valve lebih cocok diaplikasikan ke fluida liquid sedang safety valve akan membuka secara sangat cepat langsung 60 opening apabila terjadi excess pressure dan akan menutup kembali hanya apabila pressure telah berada dibawah pressure normal set point safety valve sangat cocok diaplikasikan ke fluida gas iv troubleshooting 1 valve leak jika valve tidak bekerja dengan baik maka kemungkinan besar terjadi leak bagian yang paling sering terjadi leak adalah pada packing gland hal ini bisa diatasi dengan mengencangkan gland nut setelah itu maka periksa kembali putaran handwell karena setelah mengencangkan gland nut maka akan terjadi gesekan antara packing dengan stem yang menyebabkan handwell susah di gerakkan kebocoran juga biasa terjadi didaerah sambungan body dan bonnet daerah body dan disekitar flange valve yang tidak bekerja dengan baik kemungkinan juga disebabkan karena adanya kerusakan fisik pada valve itu sendiri oleh karena itu pemeriksaan fisik sangat penting untuk dilakukan lebih dahulu sebelum adanya perlakuan yang lebih jauh p gt 3 pemberian pelumas pemberian pelumas pada valve terutama pada stem sangat penting untuk menjaga ketahanan valve sampai disini mengenai valve jika ada masukan

7396392 if a contemporary worship service is the best witnessing tool in the box then why give a rip about what goes on outside the worship
7396393 youd have to find 80 million more people that churches forgot to count to get to 40 percent
7396394 the worship team was young and pretty dressed in the kind of quality cotton punk clothing one buys at the gap
7396395 they sound like theyre singing in beer commercials and perhaps this is not coincidental
7396396 sacramentis has been a pioneer site on worship and culture for seven years from the beginning it has been a gathering spot for the most helpful worship ideas and resources we could find sacramentis has also been a place where church leaders could go deeper into what classic christian worship is and does and where they could re imagine worship for communities where churchgoing is no longer the norm but as culture has become incessantly more spiritual and adamantly less religious we at sacramentis have become convinced that the primary meeting place with our unchurched friends is now outside the church building worship must finally become as paul reminds us more life than event romans 12 1 2 to this end we will be focusing on the radically different kind of leadership practices necessary to transform our congregations from destinations to conversations from services to service and from organizations to organisms

7396412 if men define situations as real they are real in their consequences

7396414 ich bin fest davon berzeugt dass das managed care f r die behandlung in der psychiatrie und psychotherapie gef hrlich ist besonders weil das bed rfnis des patienten nach einer behandlung welches wichtig f r eine gelungene psychotherapie ist pervertiert wird die frage ist was f r eine art medizin heute praktiziert wird es geht auch darum das errungene recht des vertragszwanges zwischen krankenkassen und jedem vom bag anerkannten arzt zu wahren es ist offensichtlich dass das system des managed care nicht kompatibel ist mit der freien arztwahl des patienten

7396439 they couldnt keep up with him they couldnt find enough things to teach him
7396440 he said he got to see all the great operas at the met and didnt have to pay for one of them
7396441 he was never a man of means but he had a knack of always making sure we had what we needed
7396442 i think theres real power in people reflecting upon a very real moment in history and seeing what that has to do with where we are now
7396443 he told us that nonviolence was a steady loving confrontation
7396444 they keep putting fingers in the dike when are they going to get to the core operations of the sea and the convention center
7396445 i hate to be so blunt i fear unfortunately that if they go back there and get money its going to come at the expense of a lot of cultural and educational groups that are delineated in rad funding
7396446 because it wasnt part of the original list for funding i dont know that its fair to say that its not a regional asset i think it clearly meets the definition of a regional asset which makes it eligible for funding
7396447 it was not ever assumed that the convention center would be one of the regional assets
7396448 our objective is to maximize the usage of the building and minimize the deficit
7396449 i think we can safely assume there will be no significant growth in revenue if you look at the projections through the early parts of 2009 theyre generally pessimistic about economic activity
7396450 the chickens have been here nine years and now theres this big thing about it
7396451 to get rid of the chickens how hard would it be to bring a cage put feed in it and catch them
7396452 my main fear is the diseases they carry because i have two small babies
7396453 if my babies get sick im going to kill the chickens
7396454 in the hot sun you know what rotten eggs smell like
7396455 they stop making noise at dark until 2 or 3 a m and at 4 oclock they are so loud you dont need an alarm clock
7396456 we are dealing with this in a humane way in an orderly fashion this is a legal place for government to step in
7396457 were looking to handle the problem which is a health and safety issue
7396458 contribute to the historical ambiance and small town atmosphere of the city
7396459 there has been considerable interest in developing the natural gas resources contained in the marcellus shale interests that could yield a substantial economic boom for the commonwealth
7396460 this addendum to the permit application will reduce administrative delays for the drilling industry while helping us to determine what demands will be placed on our natural water resources
7396461 of course we had discussions but after that sammy wrote i was in charge of correcting the spelling mistakes in english i dont know much english but i can spell
7396462 chase has been on the rock wall five or six times in 45 minutes its like a big playground for them even when its nice outside and they can go to the pool theyd rather come here

7396464 and well have drawings and images of exhibits of the new building displayed as they are finalized visitors who are disappointed that sportsworks is going away temporarily will be able to come to the science center and see whats coming
7396465 its been designed with kids in mind but a lot of parents and teenagers come through and learn about the science behind the sports that theyve been playing and watching for a long time
7396466 green and natural are big now the anti aging benefits of the sea meet a need
7396467 this was definitely a brand positioned for spas and salons and specialty retailing
7396468 but depending upon how this does i would consider potentially other opportunities that become available
7396469 you have to start out small to make sure youre hitting every aspect and detail and marketing it properly everything from manufacturing to marketing and ensuring the quality
7396470 lasted for hours without making my lips feel dry and chapped
7396471 they want all natural for their face and something thats good for the environment as well
7396472 this place come hell or high water they get you out of bed
7396473 i dont know whats going on behind the scenes but i know people treat me with decency and respect i never had anyone abuse me
7396474 were thankful that their problems have not affected all of the residents but its a dangerous and fatal situation to be in waiting and wondering which resident could potentially be next
7396475 we have to act the way we do to ensure another family member doesnt have to endure the grief or trauma other families have been through
7396476 its almost like theyre picking you to shreds for no reason
7396477 to me its an insult to get a provisional license it used to be they were just for bad homes now i dont know
7396478 if theres a way for us to work with the facility to fix whatever problem so we dont have to remove people then we will do that
7396479 but if its a systemic problem we have to get residents out
7396480 we met with our residents to see if they had anything as other abuse to report
7396481 we sent letters to every family asking about awareness of issues and said if they had future suspicions we need to know there was not one call that came in
7396482 i think theyre on a witch hunt to close them down because of past activities
7396483 i only know them as reputable people who want to serve these elderly adults
7396484 the difference you see here is its family run so you see more love and caring going into it
7396485 with 90 percent of these employees there is no better but wherever you go youre going to get a couple of misfits
7396486 we cant continue to allow people to live in a facility where it appears as if we are just waiting for the next incident to take place
7396487 the class of 2012 has grown up in an era where computers and rapid communication are the norm and colleges no longer trumpet the fact that residence halls are wired and equipped with the latest hardware
7396488 it is a multicultural politically correct and green generation that has hardly noticed the threats to their privacy and has never feared the russians and the warsaw pact
7396489 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
7396490 ever since i got hurt ive become a lot better player
7396491 who knows what would have happened if i had been in there maybe i would have been the guy who missed the tackle on garrards run
7396492 i thought travis kirschke did a great job filling in for me look at the film he did a great job i cant say that i would have done better or made more plays than he did
7396493 the 30s now are the new 20s dont you know that
7396494 ive been truly blessed when i first came into the league i was hoping to play maybe two years and get a head start in life i never thought id get this far
7396495 a lot of people have told me the team really missed me last season
7396496 it was a matter of us coming out and setting our mind to it
7396497 actually i think age is to our benefit because we have experience
7396498 guys can rotate and get in there and play if you have young backups sometimes they dont know what theyre doing when they get into a game at least now with the veterans you know what to expect and how theyll perform
7396499 guys playing in their early 30s are playing like theyre young now because we take care of our bodies year round back in the day when people didnt work out a lot and used training camp to get into shape their bodies fell apart younger we keep in shape year round now we can play longer
7396500 besides nick im the youngest guy out there right now
7396501 we are young bucks though i still feel good like im still improving i think we still play really well up front obviously we had some slipups last year but weve held ourselves to a high standard and i think weve done pretty good with that
7396502 i thought paul ernster did a nice job punting for us
7396503 i am not sure that i really like a situation where one or two people control the legislation that is passed in the chamber when it comes down to the whims of one or two people
7396504 some times that is not as good for the country when a party actually decides whether or not legislation should pass
7396505 but look my only advice to independents is that i hope that they dont get into the position of blackmailing governments for their own ends
7396506 they forced legislation upon the australian people with work choices the cheek of the coalition
7396507 australians like the idea of a third party like family first standing in the middle and being independent of the two major parties
7396508 i think from a tactical point for the greens in the south metro of perth i think is a bit of a blunder
7396509 we want to fix that statistic were concerned about it
7396510 the message here is crystal clear and that is children need to be in school
7396511 thats a high priority and were reinforcing it through the legislation
7396512 it is critical that these children are enrolled to go to school and then attend school on a regular basis
7396513 it is critical that we trial this measure that we look at whether or not it does in fact make sure that parents do the right thing and get their children enrolled at school and attending on a regular basis
7396514 we will be working those arrangements in the trial communities first with a view to a national rollout that has schools participating
7396515 we are looking at the needs in the timor leste public sector and its public service for an intensified training program for grassroots middle level and senior level in order to make sure east timor is properly equipped to address its challenges for development
7396516 that applies particularly given the size of the investment fund which east timor has already secured for itself to fund part of its economic development future
7396517 it is an important legal obligation you cant flout the law
7396518 the commonwealths measure is another important step in ensuring that these parents its a small minority live up to their obligation to their children and obey the law
7396519 an information system resource whose value lies in monitoring unauthorized or illicit use of that resource

7396566 people are buying these ties and may not even realize the change
7396567 but the look is more clean and its a way to get that more moderate guy into the modern look
7396568 its frustrating for us because when you go down to three and a half you cant appreciate the fabric
7396569 the only faux pas is to wear a tie that misrepresents you
7396570 when you think about the dotcom days there was this era of prosperity but you looked around and people were dressed as if there wasnt
7396571 the person who wears the skinny tie to work doesnt have to wear a tie to work
7396572 if you have a big man and he puts on a three and a half inch tie hes going to look terrible
7396573 that guy doesnt want to think about getting dressed in the morning
7396574 he just wants to have ties that match his shirts ties that match his suits
7396575 they like the idea that someone might say where did you get that tie its a statement of luxury an artisan product

7396582 the younger one is just sad im not around the older one blames me for every hardship every day she blames me more and we drift further apart the fucked up thing is that there is nothing i or anyone else can do about it

7396585 huh yeah ive heard of the peace corps arent they touring with coldplay or something
7396586 the only freedom deserving the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs or impede their efforts to obtain it each is the proper guardian of his own health whether bodily or mental and spiritual mankind are greater gainers by sufering each other to live as seems good to themselves than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest

7396591 in the wake of the public comments period after consulting with the new york police department which had originally requested the rule change mta nyc transit will not go forward with the institution of a photo ban
7396592 we are not pressing for a ban our officers will continue to investigate and intercede if necessary if the activity photo related or not is suspicious
7396593 this is truly a victory for photojournalism and we must continue our efforts on issues like these to protect our freedoms and first amendment rights
7396594 thanks to todd maisel and everyone else who worked to oppose this proposal for their persistence in this matter
7396595 we want to thank kurt wimmer and amy levine of the law firm covington and burling for the enormous amount of work that they did on our behalf
7396596 they filed an extensive legal brief to the mta on behalf of the nppa which clearly laid out all of our legal arguments for why the ban was unconstitutional
7396597 nppa pursued this proposed subway ban from many angles with public statements legal comments a call to members to submit their own comments a public protest news articles cooperative efforts with other groups and plans to be there in person for the vote
7396598 it may seem like a lot of effort for one city but we really believed that this case would be looked at throughout the nation and that other cities would follow the lead of what happened in new york city
7396599 also coming to our aid was the new york press photographers association the national press club the new york civil liberties union asmp and ppa we also thank the many camera clubs throughout new york state who pledged their support and sent letters to the mta condemning the ban we thank the thousands of opponents of the ban for signing our petitions sending letters and commenting during the mta 90 day public comment period that was dubiously launched during the holidays to minimize reaction the mta however found that despite the holidays they received thousands of angry comments against the ban it also resulted in mayor mike bloomberg condemning the proposal and the new york city police department disavowing the plan
7396600 nppa region 2 director diorio said this victory will help in efforts against other censorship proposals
7396601 including one that has already been started in the town of hempstead long island ny where officials there despite not having a law had banned photography in public parks and on beaches
7396602 after taking blistering criticism from the nppa the town of hempstead rescinded a ban on photography at their public beaches and parks that had been made policy by their parks department more than 12 years ago hepstead town supervisor kate murry acted quickly to correct the unconstitutional policy that was originally created because some residents were concerned about unauthorized photography of their children town officials now realize the ban was not supportable by law and they could not make a ban on photography in public places where there is no reasonable expectation of privacy

7396658 pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race and to nuclear disarmament
7396659 us and iranian relations what a nuclear iran truly means
7396660 the surge in iraq has put the lid on sectarian conflict but in baghdad if you are a shiite and you go into a sunni neighborhood you fear for your life and vice versa this is a country that was put together by outsiders by western powers after they defeated the turkish ottoman empire and it will take a long long time for the clashing groups to settle their differences if ever so far mostly they have achieved peace by driving each other out of each others neighborhoods remember the assyrians fighting the babylonians in the bible the assyrians are still there babylon is called baghdad now these people are experts at holding grudges for hundreds if not thousands of years but the one thing they can unite around is they want us out we invaded them we christians invaded a muslim country every time a terrorist holes up in a house full of children and those children get bombed by our planes we will get the blame if someone drives a car at one of our checkpoints and doesnt stop when signaled to do so its our fault when the occupants get shot and so on there is no escaping the fact that we are where we dont belong
7396661 there are people who say that fluctuations in the suns radiation not human action are driving global warming in the first place xyz studied that possibility and found the variations in the solar cycle were not large enough in the short run to explain what is happening second if there is an increase in the suns heat that we cant control thats all the more reason why we have to start changing what is in our power to control if were facing two threats rather than one we have no time to lose

7396663 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7396664 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7396665 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7396666 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain
7396667 that message is going to echo clearly from this platform
7396668 the republican track record on national security has not been particularly good
7396669 my job in this campaign is to explain that talking tough and acting dumb is not a way to keep you safe and secure

7396674 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7396675 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7396676 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7396677 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7396678 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7396679 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7396680 i just want to study and be with my mom

7396692 some bullying and brazen countries and their worthless followers wanted to impose their will on the iranian nation but the president and the government have stood up to their excessive demands and moved forward
7396693 blocking the infiltration of a westernization trend in the government
7396694 we tolerated the executive power in these three years now we can say its over
7396695 the exalted leaders approval of the governments direction is a shining medal on our hearts
7396696 khameneis comment is an open support for ahmadinejad his backing of ahmadinejad is also an answer to growing criticism of the government
7396697 we are comfortable in our own skin we dont need to prove anything to the world
7396698 dont kid yourself its going to rain on you its a tradition to get soaked in london and youll have a great time anyway
7396699 i think that with british ingenuity wit and all the rest of it resourcefulness we are going to produce a games opening ceremony closing ceremony and everything in between that will be in our own sweet way just as fantastic
7396700 i say this respectfully to our chinese hosts who have excelled magnificently at ping pong ping pong was invented on the dining tables of england

7396702 the capture of abu tiba and abu othman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the aqi network
7396703 this is a major loophole that was left in after the mccain feingold bill in 2002
7396704 you know you remember a million dollar donor if youre a party leader and that sticks not just in your bank account to pay for the convention but it sticks in your mind as well
7396705 we follow all the rules and regulations created by the federal election commission
7396706 many of the donors and companies are people that really drive our economy and the idea that they need to buy influence or access through a political convention is a little bit unrealistic if they need to reach someone they can probably just do that
7396707 every olympic medal won by canada was my favourite moment
7396708 the canadian mens eight rowing team winning a gold medal was a great show of strength and character
7396709 the best moments were the opening ceremonies and the eric lamazes win
7396710 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
7396711 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7396712 has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7396713 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7396714 thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november

7396753 there are two things driving the market in october the bike test changes to a more difficult time consuming and expensive test so many are rushing to get bikes and take tests
7396754 the more significant thing is the economic situation the housing market is in difficulties fuel bills are so high so people are looking for savings in all parts of their life including how they get around as a result they are turning to scooters and bikes as day to day transport and for commuting it saves money avoids congestion enjoys free parking and makes commuting less stressful people are also interested in the lower co2 emissions than travelling by car

7396762 over the past four years and touring almost non stop during the same time span the band is set to release a new album called
7396763 was made available for fans to download friday night and is the first glimpse at treasures vocals and the slightly different sound of the shinys
7396764 ik lag dus heerlijk in het zonnetje toen dat wijf weer voor mijn verblijf stond kijk normaal hou ik wel van een teefje dat mijn aandacht wil maar van 57 jarige mensen ben ik dus niet gediend he ik heb wel een reputatie die ik hoog moet houden
7396765 maar ja vrijdag ging ze dus iets te ver plotseling gingen er een paar kleine ventjes stenen naar mijn kop gooien ik had al vaker bij de directie aangekaart dat er eens gesproken moest worden over een dierentuinwet maar ja veel gelul in de politiek maar voorlopig blijft dat stenen gooien maar doorgaan nou zag ik dus ook nog eens dat wijf weer naar me lachen en dat was de spreekwoordelijke druppel
7396766 ja leuk zon greppel maar ik had dus al lang door dat ik daar wel overheen zou komen luister die verzorgers zijn allemaal toffe peren snijden je appeltjes wassen wat bananen dus ik blijf al jaren netjes op dat eiland zitten maar ja feyenoord had ook al een kutseizoen dus ik was net wat geprikkelder dan normaal en als je dan hoort dat ze co adriaanse willen halen zon griet je lastig blijft vallen die dierentuinwet op zich laat wachten en van die koters stenen gooien dan ga je je bent een rotterdamse zilverrug of niet
7396767 ernstig ernstig kijk zij wil aandacht van een gorilla dan geef je die op een gorillawijze is het weer niet goed toen ik door had dat ze niet zo goed reageerde op mijn antwoord ben ik netjes van haar afgestapt en naar de kantine gelopen om een pilsje te drinken toen ik daar aankwam bleek dat ze de tap hadden dichtgegooid ja dan breekt er echt iets
7396768 ook weer zon reactie als ze me nou netjes hadden gevraagd of ik terug naar dat eiland had willen lopen had ik dat ook wel gedaan nee hoor schieten ze gelijk weer zon pijl in je reet
7396769 luister ik ben helemaal niet moeilijk maar je moet goed begrijpen eigenlijk hoor ik in het regenwoud in afrika te wonen daar heerst een hele andere cultuur dat moet je respecteren maar goed ik ben redelijk geintegreerd maar dat vrouwen zo respectloos met je omgaan doet pijn heel veel pijn ik overweeg dan ook een flinke claim in te dienen voor de opgelopen emotionele schade
7396770 ja ook hen neem ik het een en ander kwalijk ik vind dat ze best een limiet mogen stellen op de kwantiteit en kwaliteit van de bezoekers die langs komen het is toch van de zotte dat sommige mensen iedere dag langskomen op den duur word je daar toch knettergek van het is dat mijn schoonmoeder nog ergens in kameroen door de bossen rent maar voor je het weet staat die hier ook voor de deur
7396771 het is een afschuwelijk gevecht tussen twee wolven de ene wolf is slecht hij bestaat uit woede jaloezie verdriet spijt hebzucht verwaandheid zelfmedelijden schuldgevoelens wrok minderwaardigheid leugens valse trots superioriteit en ego de andere wolf is goed hij is vreugde vrede liefde hoop kalmte nederigheid vriendelijkheid welwillendheid medegevoel vrijgevigheid waarheid compassie en geloof binnen in jou woedt dezelfde strijd en datzelfde geldt voor ieder mens
7396772 we zijn er mee bezig mevrouw we wilde hem gister al klaar hebben maar er kwam wat tussen ik denk dat het aan het eind van de middag wordt
7396773 what do you want to do today we dont mind
7396774 i cant wait to get home to find out what happens when
7396775 god is god and i am not and i can only see a part of the picture he is painting
7396776 want god had de wereld zo lief dat hij zijn enige zoon heeft gegeven opdat iedereen die in hem gelooft niet verloren gaat maar eeuwig leven heeft
7396777 en hij nam een brood sprak het dankgebed uit brak het brood deelde het uit en zei dit is mijn lichaam dat voor jullie gegeven wordt doe dit telkens opnieuw om mij te gedenken 20 zo nam hij na de maaltijd ook de beker en zei deze beker die voor jullie wordt uitgegoten is het nieuwe verbond dat door mijn bloed gesloten wordt
7396778 as francis fukuyama famously put it at the end of history there are no serious ideological competitors left to liberal democracy
7396779 nor has the growth of the chinese and russian economies produced the political liberalization that was once thought inevitable growing national wealth and autocracy have proven compatible after all
7396780 europe is ill equipped to a problem that it never anticipated having to face
7396781 this great 21st century entity the eu now confronts 19th century power and europes postmodern tools of foreign policy were not designed to address more traditional geopolitical challenges there is a real question as to whether europe is institutionally or temperamentally able to play the kind of geopolitical games in russias near abroad that russia is willing to play
7396782 there is some question about the united states as well
7396783 international order does not rest on ideas and institutions alone it is shaped by configurations of power
7396784 the optimists in the early post cold war years were not wrong to believe that a liberalizing russia and china would be better international partners they were just wrong to believe that this evolution was inevitable
7396785 the great fallacy of our era has been the belief that a liberal and democratic international order would come about by the triumph of ideas alone or by the natural unfolding of human progress
7396786 after the second world war hans morgenthau warned idealists against imagining that at some point the final curtain would fall and the game of power politics would no longer be played
7396787 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected we have urged an immediate halt to the violence we call for the end of the russian bombings

7396794 he elisha replied to his servant dont be afraid for our side outnumbers them then elisha prayed o lord open his eyes so he can see the lord opened the servants eyes and he saw that i want to live like this
7396795 the bible assumes as a self evident fact that men can know god with at least the same degree of immediacy as they know any other person or thing that comes within the field of their experience
7396796 what can all this mean except that we have in our hearts organs by means of which
7396797 we should have to prepare ourselves to this exam lets pray for our guidance
7396798 my brother firefighter frankie esposito and cousin capt michael esposito

7396807 we dropped a bit in the air but other than that it was fine
7396808 i knew there was a hole somewhere but i didnt know what was going on
7396809 there was wind swirling around the plane and some condensation

7396812 hiring the best people needs to be an ongoing constant effort where companies show candidates why theyre a great place to work every company has a story but too few companies tell theirs well or at all social media technologies allow companies to tell their stories with new tools and in new ways
7396813 home is the place where when you have to go there they have to take you in
7396814 today i have rolled away the reproach of egypt from you
7396815 but as commander of the army of the lord i have now come

7396829 blogs are not as significant as their self endeared curators would like to think they ride along with the msm like remora fish on the bellies of sharks picking at the scraps
7396830 nobody wants to be an imbecile people also like validation of what they believe the internet like all free markets has a way of gratifying the mediocrity of the masses
7396831 i just checked the exploratory committee websites of hillary obama edwards mccain and romney a few have blogs or so they call them not one of them actually write any posts
7396832 presidential campaign songs 1789 to 1996 by canadian born folksinger oscar brand

7396899 jacks personality really sets the stage for what you see
7396900 hes quite a character but he isnt used to our way of movie making so while his fans will recognize the elements they like its all about him and the girls and how he gets them to take on his big dick the technical aspects have improved

7396906 jacks the rarest thing youll find in either adult or mainstream celebrities a superstar who has managed to remain affable and approachable i simply cant believe how meek and humble this guy is and i think its a part of his appeal that has been underutilized by other companies in the past he has presence and hes a joy to market to both adult and mainstream audiences
7396907 brayden do you know what umma used to do to me when i made too much noise in the car
7396908 wow i didnt see him theres a huge blindspot in this car
7396909 het huidige artikel 1 van de nederlandse grondwet leidt in de praktijk al te vaak tot een inperking van de vrijheid van meningsuiting en verhindert het maken van gerechtvaardigde onderscheiden door alles op de grote hoop van discriminatie te gooien ongelijke gevallen hoeven niet gelijk te worden behandeld

7396919 en over huizen heb ik het ook niet gehad maar dat zul je morgen wel zien het is nogal moeilijk te beschrijven
7396920 heb je daar ook n of ander slijmerig geval voor
7396921 het is misschien niet een aardappel zoals jij die kent maar hier noemen ze het wel degelijk een aardappel ze zijn erg lekker een beetje zoetig en erg goed tegen honger
7396922 het is al een oude maar wel lekker groot daar kunnen we best samen van eten
7396923 ja veel meer heb je hier op de vlakte niet en ze zijn echt lekker hoor

7396932 maar ik heb ook zon verschrikkelijke dorst en een honger ik denk niet dat ik het nog lang volhoud
7396933 is dat je hier misschien wat langer bent dan jij denkt
7396934 waar h b je het over en waarom zit je in godsnaam steeds zo met je hand in je zak
7396935 ik zit met mijn hand in mijn zak omdat jij zon dorst hebt

7396937 ik zie niet in wat dat walgelijke ding met mijn dorst te maken heeft
7396938 en misschien moet je niet zo lelijk over hem praten hij gaat zo meteen je leven redden

7396941 laat hem niet vallen dan is ie meteen verdwenen ze zijn wel te vinden maar moeilijk en ik heb er nog maar twee op voorraad

7396985 ik ben een realist ik heb er geen probleem mee dat erover werd geschreven waar ik wel problemen mee heb is dat het nieuws geregeerd lijkt te worden door de vraag hoe er zoveel mogelijk kijkers en dus kopers want elke klik is geld waard kunnen worden getrokken ik kreeg heel veel interviewaanvragen in het begin toen alleen het videofilmpje was opgedoken heb ik even kort gereageerd bij rtl boulevard toen vervolgens ook de fotos naar buiten kwamen heb ik mijn mond gehouden het was een traumatische ervaring we hebben niemand pijn willen doen met onze priv fotos maar doordat ze uitlekten is dat wel gebeurd de mensen waarvan we houden hebben we daarmee bezeerd dat is verschrikkelijk

7397015 chris unique vision is what made batman begins such an outstanding film and we could not imagine anyone else at the helm of the dark knight
7397016 we also cant wait to see two such formidable actors as christian and heath face off with each other as batman and the joker
7397017 im excited to continue the story we started with batman begins
7397018 our challenge in casting the joker was to find an actor who is not just extraordinarily talented but fearless watching heath ledgers interpretation of this iconic character taking on christian bales batman is going to be incredible
7397019 the lamborghini murcielago roadster was a natural choice for batman as the way its doors open perfectly matches the image of the superhero speading his wings

7397023 i think theres a vague sense out there that movies are becoming more and more unreal
7397024 i know ive felt it the demand we put on ourselves was to be as spectacular as possible but not depend on computer graphics to do it
7397025 ive sat through these huge movies and thought what went wrong how come when people have all that time and money the talent for storytelling so often goes straight out the window
7397026 batman is a marvelously complex character somebody who has absolute charm and then just like that can turn it into ice cold ruthlessness
7397027 there are very few actors who can do that and christian is one of them
7397028 chris was a real taskmaster about justifying everything in the real world
7397029 he kept saying its gotta be grounded its gotta be real

7397066 in the first shots the car was in the black primer which really didnt come on so strong
7397067 they wanted to get more of a gloss on it we then airbrushed white highlights around the outside edges but that didnt come out as strong either thats when we went into the 3 4 inch red fluorescent glow edges to accentuate the batface and fins it made it much more dramatic

7397080 dont you ever lie to any of my boys again
7397081 said my father sitting next to his son knowing that good lessons were taught today and knowing that i understood
7397082 my son charles is 12 years old he asked me about being jewish i think it is time that he learns for himself ive never made him be a jew ive never forced him to choose he always knew that any decision would be his
7397083 this is a little pamphlet that talks about the temple and all of the things charles can do there are hebrew lessons bar mitzvah preparation youth events
7397084 said rabbi steve as he shuffled through all of the papers seemingly trying to find one specific paper
7397085 as you can see there are several levels of membership and of course high holy day participation is extra one of the unique one of the strong points of our temples costs are the customized pricing schedules based on personal income the base cost is two per cent of income and then there are additional fees for the building fund the school fund you can see for yourself its all on the sheet
7397086 i really see nothing wrong with the price sheet it all seems to be very self explanatory and well laid out i even saw the value in the comment rabbi steve made about this temple in particular having a very high percentage of the movers amp shakers in the community as its members
7397087 my son and i were just visiting with rabbi steve about joining the temple my son wants to learn about being jewish
7397088 perhaps you have a sunday school or something where my son can go once or twice just enough so he can decide for himself whether he wants to learn about being jewish
7397089 when i find out ill let you know and rabbi steve also thank you and thank rabbi steve both of you have been very helpful

7397100 i have logic on my side and as long as i dont really listen to you i know im right
7397101 you can sign about jesus and drink wine all day
7397102 lets say that hitler is on his death bed he gets the clear light undeniable unequivocal completely sincere belief in jesus absolutely no faking really really gets it would pass 100 any evangelical lie detector test anyone would throw at it does hitler now go to heaven
7397103 yes even hitler if he accepts jesus as his lord and savior regardless of when will be saved and go to heaven
7397104 so your basic holocaust your jews gypsies poles french all of em completely wiped off the books i accept jesus and my checkbook balances of course i have to truly truly accept jesus
7397105 ok say that hitler through no fault of his own suffered from delusionary behavior
7397106 ok lets say all the guys are down in the bunker with hitler goering himmler goebels eichmann all of em and they all go through the same psychotic delusionary episode point being that all of them truly completely and unequivocally accept jesus christ as their lord and savior do all of them get redemption and go to heaven
7397107 so theres a real good possibility that heaven could end up being chock full of certifiable raving lunatics
7397108 we could make an entire incoming freshman class of nothing but jews smart jews rich jews poor jews athletic jews jews from the city jews from the country an entire class of jews but we dont

7397120 lets say youre an asshole well then this three piece suit and white shirt and red and blue regimental tie would fit your comfort level not to mention the perfect preppie statement of my cordovan weejuns now lets say that you arent an asshole and you realize that there is a guy across the table from me looking for a job then you would get past my lowest common denominator fashion statement and try to find out who i am
7397121 i can dig that but what about the overkill of the briefcase
7397122 overkill for some de rigueur for others how do you know that i dont have anything except a fine assortment of hershey bars in here no papers no documents no wall street journal just chocolate

7397134 you were going to tell me how long you and miss possible have been fucking
7397135 really and how long were you dating before you became intimate
7397136 two weeks ago i was under the influence of the attitudinator with my brothers being evil an all i turned to the one place i thought i could get help but even under the influence of the reverse polarizer i just couldnt bring myself to actually ask kim possible for help so i took a job at her school hoping that i could buy myself a few days to figure everything out
7397137 dr d wouldve been a liability either way he wouldve either tried to recruit my bothers which by the way wouldve made me stay good or he wouldve tried to hurt them
7397138 and well my brothers couldve hurt him i thought it was best if he wasnt involved
7397139 in a manner of speaking yes like i said i wanted to go directly to her but something stopped me so i used my credentials to get a temporary job at her school it took my brothers less than 24 hours to locate me thats when kim stepped in and offered to help
7397140 she invited me to stay with her while we sorted out the situation with electronique and my brothers
7397141 and you began a romantic relationship with miss possible then
7397142 the attitudinator wouldnt allow me to umm engage in my usual activities
7397143 well im not 100 percent gay i guess im more 70 30 leaning strongly towards women
7397144 oh dont look at me like that im a lesbian but well wait a sec i dont need to explain that to you
7397145 as kimmie explained it electroniques adjustments made that part of my personality shut down because i viewed it as evil
7397146 so you wanted to begin a relationship with kimmie uh miss possible but the attitudinator prevented you from that
7397147 we did go out to the movies and we double dated and i couldnt take my eyes off of her
7397148 but i also couldnt flirt with her or do any of the other the things i really wanted to do it wasnt until my last day under the influence of the attitudinator that i found a way to work around the uh settings
7397149 i um i realized i was um falling in love with her
7397150 i realized that i had been for a while now
7397151 i went back to dr drakken and i thought everything would return to business as usual then the next day she freakin shows up at the lair with my clothes
7397152 she tells me she wants to be friends but shes she acting so sooo
7397153 she was practically throwing herself on me i was in her house for three days three days she had every opportunity to to well to do what ever she freakin wanted with me but she waited until i was back to normal at the lair the lair of all places she just waltzed in there and said i brought cocoa moo and that was it
7397154 it was kim possible 17 year old global crime fighter
7397155 that weekend last weekend was when it all started and once it did neither one of us could stop
7397156 actually i take back that couldnt stop thing kimmie did break up with me for three days
7397157 yeah it rocks now hurry up shut the window and get out of here

7397200 stefan oom peter hier ik heb vandaag iets uitgevonden anita ligt in het ziekenhuis zij heeft dus niet de leiding meer over de hele organisatie tenminste ik begreep dat ze blinde darm ontsteking had met complicaties dus we hebben een paar dagen de tijd er zal wel iemand zijn die het over neemt maar toch heb ik het idee dat zij degene is die de boel leidt en dit had ze naar ik aanneem niet voorzien
7397201 wat is er wacht anders kom je even langs of heb je liever dat ik even langs kom
7397202 ik weet niet ik ach nee niets ik ben gewoon moe
7397203 ok nou slaap lekker dan alvast en ik laat nog van me horen ik bel je morgen anders wel even ok
7397204 somone should check their fruit of the flumes for some extra logs
7397205 is there no balm in oh god pour forth your healing balm into the hearts of your sick church
7397206 oh god how you must feel sad that your church is representing you as unholy
7397207 find your center remember why you teach for america be ready for chaos and love the children
7397208 if he loved me why would he let these horrible things happen to me
7397209 well you should have been old enough to witness the moscow games
7397210 the 800 metres the 1500 the darts the snooker every god damned medal worth winning we won it
7397211 darlink maybe zets vy you are mad because you so old
7397212 darling theres nothing mad about the way i live my life polluting my internal physical and mental landscapes living in a now faulty virtual bubble stumbling from crisis to crisis and then writing it down for strangers to read anyway i feel decidedly between crises at the moment what you call a personality disorder i call a personality
7397213 but what if bonkersness is as boring as this and as relatively slow the descent into madness might not be rapid at all and at such slow motion the change is so gradual that its bound to seem normal
7397214 h heb je d t even verkeerd gedacht dat ik mirte was
7397215 ik weet ook niet waar hij is hij is vanmiddag weggegaan en deed vaag over waar hij heen ging ik weet het dus niet sorry wil je wat drinken trouwens
7397216 hij had wel eens gehoord van mensen die ineens een ingeving kregen die z helder klonk dat het leek alsof er iemand achter hen stond maar hij had het nog niet zelf gehad
7397217 niet teveel drinken achter elkaar nu dat is niet goed en wij moeten ook nog
7397218 bedankt ik had al even bij het huis hiernaast staan kijken maar dat ziet er ook leeg uit daar woont zeker niemand
7397219 nee dat is een erfeniskwestie geloof ik ik zie er af en toe wel mensen heen lopen maar hoor nooit van ze er heeft ooit een ouder echtpaar gewoond maar die man ach het was zon vriendelijke oude heer h maar die is al lang geleden overleden die vrouw een heel lieve buurvrouw ik had niet zoveel contact met haar maar ik nodigde haar toch maar uit op mijn verjaardag nou die vrouw die is een tijd geleden overleden ach wanneer was het toch ik denk vorig jaar misschien iets langer geleden ik heb nooit mensen bij haar over de vloer zien komen eigenlijk maar dat heb je wel vaker bij oudere mensen h ach ja
7397220 hij had vlak daarvoor een vrouw van middelbare leeftijd de planten water geven
7397221 oh my gosh he hasnt asked me out yet and its been like 4 weeks
7397222 my book is about a prominent female attorney who after some pretty embarrassing bouts with anxiety begins the process of memoir therapy and lets just say the secrets buried beneath her pages arent very pretty
7397223 i would love to wrap my truth in fiction like you my mother just passed and i kinda feel like i can tell the story now
7397224 youre kidding my dad just passed a month after your mom and i couldnt fathom telling my story while he was alive
7397225 im not sure whether its the cultural difference between taiwan and the states
7397226 ik wist dat je zou komen niet echt heel slim van je wat wilde je beginnen als je gepakt werd je hebt mij niet eens aan horen komen ik dacht eerst dat je me had zien staan maar toen je wat om je heen had gekeken ben je doorgelopen wat als ik niet je oom was geweest maar een handlanger van anita wat als ik jou ook had meegenomen
7397227 if you teach to the test its not your fault its the fault of the system
7397228 it may be better to hold your question until youve talked to others
7397229 sorry i cant go to your party because im at my moms house
7397230 qui ens aclarir amb qu sen van les taques de caf
7397231 no tiene sentido que cada inversor est s lo aislado sin tener conocimiento de lo que otros le pueden aportar que no tenga una funci n dentro de un grupo si fuera as ni siquiera habr a mercado ya que en realidad no es otra cosa que una comunidad de inversores nuestra esencia son la comunidad porque creemos en los beneficios de la colaboraci n masiva y la innovaci n colectiva y la realidad porque s lo cuando la verdad est en medio de un grupo se puede dar una verdadera uni n que haga progresar a sus miembros y ese es nuestro fin que el mercado financiero evolucione y sea un lugar mejor para todos

7397248 h oom peter u bent weer thuis mooi ik vroeg me af ach het is dom waarschijnlijk maar ik had het idee dat het belangrijk is waar u heen bent geweest
7397249 euh ach laat maar zitten het was gewoon een gevoel ik weet het ook niet sorry ik spreek u nog wel een keer
7397250 nee wacht ga je zo slapen of heb je vanavond nog tijd om langs te komen dan kunnen we even praten

7397255 heb je gezien aan welke voorwaarden mijn creatie moet voldoen ze moet flexibel zijn 200 beweegbare delen hebben die allemaal te vervangen zijn ze moet functioneren op cola light en kliekjes een schoot hebben waar 4 kinderen op kunnen zitten een kus die alles kan genezen van een geschaafde knie tot een gebroken hart en ze mag maar 1 paar handen hebben
7397256 1 paar handen niet te geloven en dat is het standaard model dat is teveel werk voor 1 dag neem op zn minst morgen erbij om het af te maken
7397257 ik ben bijna zover ik heb deze creatie die mij zo na aan het hart ligt bijna afgerond ze geneest zichzelf al als ze ziek is en werkt 18 uur op een dag
7397258 maar ik heb haar ook heel hard gemaakt je hebt geen idee wat zij kan doormaken of voor elkaar kan krijgen
7397259 ze kan niet alleen nadenken ze is ook in staat om zaken te beredeneren en te onderhandelen
7397260 oeps ik geloof dat deze lekt u heeft er teveel ingestopt
7397261 de traan is haar manier om uiting te geven aan haar vreugde haar leed haar pijn haar teleurstellingen haar liefde haar eenzaamheid haar droefheid en haar trots
7397262 government will take the necessary precautions if armenians continue to stab in the back and assassinate the turks
7397263 dear president according to the last news we got from turkish armenia the massacre began there and an organized terror endangered the presence of the armenian people at this critical moment i am addressing to the noble feelings of your excellency and great american nation and in the name of humanity and christianity belief requesting you to promptly interfere by means of your great republics diplomatic representatives and protect my people in turkey who are left to violence of the turkish fanaticism kevork archbishop and catholicos of all armenians
7397264 i have to say mean things about you to momma to keep her happy
7397265 sign over your rights and this will all go away
7397266 the reasons for the deep rooted hostility against the turks can be cited like that the oppression policy against the christian minority and especially the armenians secondly religious prejudices and political propaganda it is hard to say where the former ends and the latter one starts thirdly the worry and the disappointment because of the re emergence of a country which we considered as defeated and disintegrated and finally the insistent rejection of the turks to defend themselves
7397267 your newspapers and the magazines would not publish it if we sent an article written by a turk if it was published your people would not read this if they read it they would not believe in it even if we sent an expert who can express the turkish opinion in your own language to america can this person find unbiased masses of listeners
7397268 i do not want to hear the truth concerning turks i have already changed my opinion about them
7397269 somehow or other it would not be published even if it was published people would not read even if it was read people would not believe
7397270 events of violence were greatly exaggerated some of the violence supposed to have happened recently did not even occur one of the local press representatives istanbul of the american relief organisation told his friends frankly that he could only send the news against the turks because it was what earned him money
7397271 the fact that they did not want to publish the report is not incomprehensible additionally m venizelos laid all his weight he objected to the publication of the incidents when the names of the witnesses were concealed and which were established without the presence of the greek representative it was rightful to behave like this not within the framework of the western commission but the local greek authorities the people who unveiled the information against greece lived in the regions under the greek occupation and they could not be exposed to greek retaliation the same legal concerns were valid for the bryce report which was about the treatment of the armenians in the ottoman empire and the german brutality in belgium despite the same reasons the allied governments did not hesitate to publish the above mentioned reports
7397272 to discredit the armenians means to weaken the struggle for turkish hostility it was difficult to eliminate the conviction that the turkish people who were trying to with disasters continuously are noble people this news will revive this conviction and will harm the prestige of the zionists and the prestige of arabs the turkish treatment towards the armenians is the greatest leverage of the government of the majesty to provide the acceptance of the radical solution for the turkish issue at home and abroad
7397273 the first thing that i heard concerning the propaganda department was that on august 1914 in walton health golf club on sunday following a lunch mr t p oconnor told lloyd george that it was necessary to respond to the propaganda which was launched by the german in america by distributing brochures in the streets and giving them to the passengers getting of the ships upon this lloyd george said see this issue what can charlie do consider this masterman accepted it
7397274 to disseminate the incidents like the struggle of the allies the efforts of the british the things done by the navy army and the merchant marine the economic and military capacities of the empire the reasons and the goals of the war the crimes and the brutality of germany and its allies the struggle of belgium the incidents which prove the non humanistic side of the submarine war the means which are used are books brochures magazines diagrams maps posters postcards pictures photographs and exhibitions
7397275 the war office issued a circular and invited the officers to report on the war incidents about the enemy and had added that the incidents did no have to be real a normal probability was enough
7397276 lies about brutality are one the most satisfactory ones especially in this country britain and america no war can be without them to discredit the enemy can be considered as patriotism
7397277 even in ordinary incidents of no importance the witnessing of people would not create absolute confidence
7397278 a photograph taken by a camera has a great effect on the people because it is reliable there is nothing more authentic than an instantaneous photograph nobody would think of doubting the authenticity of a photograph because of this if it is false it takes time to reveal it during the war the photograph assemblage became an industry all the states did this but the experts were the french
7397279 in europe soon after the news was realised about the storming of ottoman bank by armenians and attacks on the armenians some of the artists from illustrated newspapers were sent to istanbul to draw the pictures of brutal incidents one of the well known war correspondents mr melton prior was among them he was a man of energetic and determined nature he had an independent character he told me that he was in a very delicate position because of his special task people in his country heard about brutal and violent incidents and were eager to see pictures about them since the deceased armenians were buried the women and children were not harmed and none of the armenian churches were attacked providing these pictures was a problem being an honest man who appreciated the turks he refused to contrive false pictures of scenes he had not witnessed however the others were not as honest as he was consequently i saw in an italian illustrated newspaper horrible pictures which showed the massacred women and children
7397280 one of the up front names that was mentioned on the occasion of the so called brutal correctional measures was musir sakir pasha who was sent to anatolia to make reforms it was rumoured all over the world that while the field marshall was in erzurum on october 1895 that is during armenian revolt his chain watch in his hands he was instructing the soldiers to kill the armenians for one and a half hours more two hours in some of the versions taking into account the objective of our trip we visited the british consul mr graves the governor mehmet erif rauf pasha the french consul m roqueferrier and the russian consul m v a maximov we asked these people whether they believed the rumors about akir pasha m roqueferrier told us that these were ridiculous stories that were made up for fun and he added some words of appreciation for sakir pasha
7397281 russian consul m maximov said it is not my responsibility to contradict these stories what i can tell you about akir pasha is that it is true that he is very brave and kindhearted i have known him for long years he is my friend the british consul mr graves said i was not there i did not talk to him concerning this subject however the governor said that this is not true this is sufficient for me because i believe what rauf pasha says without any hesitation
7397282 do you suppose that any massacre would occur if the armenian rebels did not encourage the armenian for the rebellion
7397283 at the end of october 1922 the representative of the near east relief organisation late miss annie t allen and miss florence billings sent a report to the headquarters of the organisation in istanbul the report consisted of the condition of the turkish villages which the greeks set on fire while they were retreating the organisation never published the report as lloyd george did not publish the bristol report concerning the catastrophe in izmir caused by the greeks
7397284 during the massacres in 1905 many photographs were taken in russia
7397285 the propaganda tries to reflect some parts of the incidents block the relations between one and another and come to conclusions which are impossible to attain if the series of the incidents are examined thoroughly
7397286 propaganda is to submit evidences which people cannot find and verify by themselves to naive people the issues they think over and have wished for page 3
7397287 in the time of war this is above all to create the expected outlook and behaviour of the enemy in accordance with the prejudices about their behaviour
7397288 war is presented to the people by means of universal and simple ideals on which nobody can oppose and which are known by everybody these ideals are the symbols of the national virtues such as freedom justice democracy and christianity
7397289 characteristic brutal stories have come from the correspondents who are far from the operation area unchangeably these are told by some of the refugees whose identities were concealed more than after these stories give second hand information
7397290 the emergence of the stories concerning the massacre of the masses is disadvantageous for turkey at the final vindication we do not hesitate to reiterate that this is the evident objective of the direction of the british governments policy the nation with which we have close alliance ties and which is co religionist of millions of our citizens is accused of committing horrible crimes against humanity by relying on the evidences which are exaggerated considerably and shamelessly there is no need to apologise for trying to accuse it honourably

7397304 in a general sense it is art that helps improve our relationship with the natural world there is no definition set in stone this living worldwide movement is growing and changing as you read this much environmental art is ephemeral made to disappear or transform designed for a particular place and cant be moved or involves collaborations between artists and others such as scientists educators or community groups distributed ownership these variables can make exhibiting this work difficult for traditional museums so we created greenmuseum org an online museum for global the environmental art movement

7397323 there are tremendous incentives from government programs to explore clean energy and we can help farmers and ranchers capitalize on these
7397324 but when you look at your roi afterwards youll frequently find the return is even more impressive than the initial incentives pursuing alternative energy now is not only an important decision for our planet it can be a critically important business decision that will pay off for years to come
7397325 for farmers ranchers and rural homeowners who decide to do it themselves there are 40 to 50 time consuming and often confusing steps from start to finish in identifying selecting and implementing clean energy systems
7397326 but our expert consultants work with each individual to develop a smartenergy pro plan in as few as eight comprehensive steps

7397388 i dos amp exchanged rings i doubt if either of us understood exactly what for ever those words truely meant or how much happiness as well as desputes marriage often brings

7397393 of course im concerned about profits and losses i just dont give them top priority if you treat people right they will work more efficiently and the profits will come in
7397394 a good cop cant sleep well because he cant imprison the murderer faster a bad cop cant sleep well because he feels guilty of uncovered truth
7397395 we were always going to treat this game seriously because it was important to make sure we kept up a big gap between ourselves and everton and its now eight points
7397396 although that doesnt guarantee us fourth place with just three games to go it takes a bit of the pressure off which helps us concentrate on the champions league
7397397 im enjoying it a lot more lately because ive been involved quite a bit when i spoke at arsenal the manager hadnt been using me too much and i was a getting a little frustrated
7397398 but since then things have been good and ive managed to score a couple of goals im feeling more positive and well have to see how things go up until the end of the season
7397399 after the league match at arsenal i was pretty certain i wasnt going to start in the champions league game
7397400 its going to be different for us having to play at home first but we showed against arsenal we could really get at teams at anfield
7397401 obviously i dont expect the same sort of match against chelsea because the circumstances are different but theres no reason why we cant go out and be positive
7397402 its not something we really care about so for me to poke my nose into it now wouldnt really do any good
7397403 we talked about it a bit when it first started but although we read things in the papers its not been discussed among the players
7397404 were not told anything about whats going on and dont really expect to be
7397405 in this little number were graced by two displays of character weve got the gunslinger extraordinaire walking contradictions and i for one can see no blood from the hearts and the wrists you allegedly slit and i for one wont stand for this if this scene were a parish youd all be condemned

7397433 stacy doesnt understand men who let their wives wear their balls around her neck
7397434 he has a long contract here and he is not going anywhere
7397435 i would expect people to be watching wayne because that means he is playing well
7397436 we are hoping to use gary against liverpool reserves this week thats the plan
7397437 hes getting better and he is improving all the time hes over his last injury and he has been training now for over two weeks and he is at a good level
7397438 because he has been out for so long he needs games now and hopefully he can start next thursday
7397439 it will be a good introduction for him game wise
7397440 weve been trying to get players in on loan ever since i came here and hopefully we can get some things done
7397441 it is difficult because if you go to premiership clubs for loans they cant replace them so they are reluctant to let them go but we will keep trying
7397442 the one i would like to get sorted out is olof
7397443 mellberg who joined villa for 5m from racing santander in 2001 is set to be offered a new three year deal by oneill
7397444 in the torment of the insufficiency of everything attainable we come to realize that here in this life all symphonies remain unfinished
7397445 he is their stronghold in time of trouble the lord helps them and delivers them he delivers them from the wicked and saves them because they take refuge in him
7397446 o splendor of gods glory bright o thou that bringest light from light o light of light lights living spring o day all days illumining
7397447 she was sitting on the toilet and was somewhat disoriented
7397448 she was not glued she was not tied she was just physically stuck by her body it is hard to imagine i still have a hard time imagining it myself
7397449 according to him she did not want to leave the bathroom
7397450 she was sitting on the toilet and was somewhat disoriented
7397451 she said that she didnt need any help that she was ok and did not want to leave
7397452 we pried the toilet seat off with a prybar and the seat went with her to the hospital
7397453 what surprises me is somebody wasnt called in a bit earlier
7397454 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7397455 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7397456 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7397457 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7397458 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7397459 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7397460 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7397461 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7397462 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7397463 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7397464 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7397465 were expecting the worst of the tropical storm this afternoon
7397466 they can see its not a huge problem some have even gone out on activities on tours or sand biking
7397467 im not surprised he has been getting so much praise recently his performances speak for themselves he is capable of just about anything
7397468 obviously it is not going to be easy with the likes of steven gerrard frank lampard owen hargreaves and gareth barry in his position
7397469 but he is still only young and in time i believe he will play in centre midfield for england
7397470 excellence can be attained if you care more than others think is wise risk more than others think is safe dream more than others think is practical and expect more than others think is possible
7397471 dont walk behind me i will not lead dont walk in front of me i will not follow just walk beside me and be my friend
7397472 as long as youre going to think anyway think big
7397473 if at first you dont succeed skydiving is not for you
7397474 expecting the world to treat you fairly because you are a good person is a little like expecting the bull not to attack you because you are a vegetarian
7397475 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world and i believe this is something that will have positive effects for the long term
7397476 if god comes back and he sneezes what do you say to him

7397507 we feel like were on a mission to go out and put positive things out into the world
7397508 we get along with them well and its really great to see our fans starting to get into their music
7397509 one may have dancier rhythms than the other but they both have significant female fan bases its a great date night and a girls night out thats what we were looking for and its definitely working
7397510 i dont even think we really got into that music we had skipped that growing up our big influence back then was the beatles and then later we got into michael jackson and stevie wonder and prince
7397511 but a lot of what were talking about now the bee gees and eagles and fleetwood mac these bands with beautiful production we got into that later
7397512 its a really intense crash course in the idea of being here now
7397513 can be kind of like groundhog day the schedule of each day can be very similar youve got to keep it fresh and try not to get stuck in a routine a rut thats something well take into other aspects of our lives
7397514 our communication as friends keeps getting deeper and more healthy
7397515 being in a band is kind of like a marriage its good training for the rest of our lives we dont even really have to discuss our disagreements we just know how to let them go and forgive and move on
7397516 we dont set up too much time to write on road theres so much energy devoted to the show and staying healthy
7397517 when you dive into creative mode you lose track of things like eating and drinking water you just cant devote that kind of energy while youre on the road we have to think of ourselves like athletes on a tour like this its when you get home that you can stay up for nights in a row and have no other focus than being creative

7397535 intensely erotic and compelling flesh tones explores the disturbing realm that lies between love and obsession
7397536 im sorry you are having a bad time or that you are hurt
7397537 i am sorry that this hurt you i wish that i could take this away
7397538 im sorry i did such and such but it only happened because you did not fill in whatever lame excuse you thought to offer there that reassigns blame again back to the victim or anyone else if this is really not your fault do not apologize at all
7397539 im just going to run in its okay to park here for a second

7397544 some people were running away but others couldnt move and the car blew up
7397545 it offers you an opportunity to communicate with people there are no censors
7397546 the right of the people to express their discontent is great that is freedom that wasnt available before
7397547 this is a great opportunity to be like the bridge between two cultures
7397548 we feel that these web logs provide a human perspective from the ground that is unique and different from what you are going to get reading a newspaper article or watching a tv report about whats happening
7397549 the news outlets bring bad news always murders a poor economy mistakes
7397550 we wanted to tell the other part of the story its not all black and its not all white we want people to get the right picture
7397551 when i watch cnn or listen to any western media its like another reality
7397552 so i want those people everywhere to know that theyre not being told the truth and most bloggers who write in english have started writing because they dont feel that the media is doing their job right
7397553 we want to prove more and more that iraqis are capable of administrating their country by themselves
7397554 they can handle the reconstruction of the country and they have very good experience in managing their country by themselves and solving all of the problems this is one of the most important messages when they read our blog
7397555 i need to be anonymous i need to keep myself safe and secure and i should not reveal my name because i could be targeted by the terrorists
7397556 theyre afraid and they have the right to be afraid i am afraid too
7397557 but i think that if i keep doing this without showing my real identity i will be losing my freedoms to those people terrorists i dont want my fears to limit my freedoms again because we had a lot of that in the past under saddam hussein
7397558 most of the statistics that come out of iraq suggest that something like only one percent of the population actually have access to the internet although there is growth in the number of internet cafes
7397559 to think that it is having a major influence on the thinking of the people or on the trends taking place in the country or the direction of politics i wouldnt say so i wouldnt think it is
7397560 and thats very very important in any open society that many voices are heard and i think that we will be learning much more from people who typically do not have access to modern communications and well be having a much more two way conversation
7397561 nobodys been home weve run into probably four families since we got here
7397562 some of them for example like syria would prefer an explosion inside the city because maybe it will be the beginning of spoiling everything in the country and even maybe the iranian government because many arabs who came to kirkuk are shiites
7397563 mullah omar is not in afghanistan i do not believe that osama is in afghanistan
7397564 a lot of progress has been made significant numbers of the leaders of al qaida have been captured
7397565 their network has been disrupted the financial network has also been disrupted
7397566 a suicide bomber wearing an explosive belt blew himself up
7397567 kirkuk should not be a reason to divide iraqis on the contrary it should be a motive for uniting iraqis and reaching a reasonable solution that will satisfy the aspirations of iraqi kurdistan and the unity of iraq and also preserve the rights of people living in kirkuk especially the turkmen
7397568 i think theyre divided i think some members of the white house have come to the conclusion that the legend is different than the fact
7397569 and when thats the case you go with the legend that somehow guantanamo has been a place of abuse and you close it down and you shorten the stories you shorten the heated debate and you get if off the table and you move on
7397570 the important thing here to understand is that the people that are at guantanamo are bad people
7397571 we invite the iraqi government and the prosecutors to hold this trial if there is to be a trial not in iraq where its not safe to hold the trial but to hold it either in the hague or in sweden or in austria or even in switzerland
7397572 i would favor sweden more than any other country where we are likely more than not a to obtain a fair trial and b in the unlikely event that our client is tried and convicted he can go straight to a detention center in sweden
7397573 to date we have not even one piece of paper one document one charge one indictment one allegation we have speculation
7397574 the americans and the british and the italians will not allow that they will not allow the death penalty to be imposed
7397575 and the president of iraq has confirmed to us he will be signing no warrant of execution as would be required under iraqi law he has made his position clear

7397577 the aliens can not reveal anything about anyones life that would not be known without the use of our technology the exception being that if a reader has a question about his or her health and the assistance of alien technology would be necessary to answer that question

7397580 just recently weve been able to distinguish the symptoms of early stage ovarian cancer from seemingly benign symptoms many women experience from time to time
7397581 we all have some of these symptoms from time to time
7397582 but if there is a symptom that is new for you or it persists for more than a couple of weeks we recommend you go to your doctor odds are it wont be cancer but it is worth having it checked just in case
7397583 we now have an evidenced based statement that these symptoms are predictive of ovarian cancer
7397584 one study conducted in 2000 showed that a significant percentage of ovarian cancer patients were wrongly diagnosed with other conditions prior to their diagnosis of ovarian cancer
7397585 people are so worried about insulting their doctor its no different than getting a job done in your house youd get more than one bid wouldnt you
7397586 the department of defense has taken these issues head on and addressed them
7397587 they continue to look into allegations of abuse people are being held to account and we think thats the way to go about this
7397588 lets hang out and look at all the beautiful ladies talk about the beautiful ladies amp go home drunk together
7397589 it was a harder step than what we have done before such operations are necessary but at the same time insurgencies are not so weak that they would be defeated in one or two weeks this will need time and this is a complex process
7397590 in response to gods decree and the heavy insistence of the iraqi brothers and their longing for paradise the ansar platoon from the land of iraq has been formed
7397591 dozens hurried to register their names to meet their god
7397592 to be honest it was a surprise to be playing against arsenal
7397593 theres a man hiding behind the statue with his pants down
7397594 your shoulder seems more cold than the tips of these needles where else to run but to the poison youve drivin me away from you
7397595 i can relate to that any time i go through a traumatic experience i want to eat
7397596 we try to isolate the iraqi people from these groups who come from outside
7397597 i think if the iraqi people share in the political process this will lessen their number and this will reduce their acceptance you know we have a problem in the western governorates they accept them sometimes hide them in their houses we want these things to be resolved because they really make a real problem for us
7397598 its just a job that will make me a lot of money
7397599 the aliens can not reveal anything about anyones life that would not be known without the use of our technology the exception being that if a reader has a question about his or her health and the assistance of alien technology would be necessary to answer that question
7397600 aliens will not threaten humans and humans will not threaten aliens
7397601 i know you have limited time and i just want to make sure we address the issue of my toe
7397602 this not only provides another person to reflect on the patients concerns
7397603 but especially another person to remember what the doctor said
7397604 we dont know we dont care were sold out for weeks youre going to pay what we demand and youre going to like it
7397605 for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord
7397606 for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you and expected end
7397607 who is this he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him
7397608 the soldiers at the bottom of the chain are taking the heat for abu ghraib and torture around the world while the guys at the top who made the policies are going scot free
7397609 this pattern of abuse across several countries did not result from the acts of individual soldiers who broke the rules
7397610 it resulted from decisions made by senior u s officials to bend ignore or cast rules aside
7397611 a year after abu ghraib the united states continues to do what dictatorships and banana republics do the world over when their abuses are discovered cover up the scandal and shift blame downwards
7397612 a wall of immunity surrounds the architects of the policy that led to all these crimes
7397613 well wes this is a bit of a strange story whats your is your trying to tell me here
7397614 how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of them if i should count them they are more in number than the sand
7397615 the aliens can not reveal anything about anyones life that would not be known without the use of our technology the exception being that if a reader has a question about his or her health and the assistance of alien technology would be necessary to answer that question
7397616 aliens will not threaten humans and humans will not threaten aliens
7397617 yeah thats because most old societies back then gathered and created towns and villages near a water source and those sources would occasionally flood
7397618 im talking about the stories they tell about their gods flooding the whole world and choosing some good people to survive on a boat or raft you know like noah
7397619 it is an old enigma whether the myths of flood obtained in different mythologies created independently of each other in different parts of the world are based on real events or not
7397620 you dont need to see that it is broken and has a crack in it
7397621 methods of physical and psychological coercion used by the interrogators appeared to be part of the standard operating procedures by military intelligence personnel to obtain confessions and extract information
7397622 over the past three years guant namo has become an icon of lawlessness
7397623 in its more than 1 000 days of executive detentions it has become a symbol of a governments attempt to put itself above the law the example it sets is dangerous to us all
7397624 a comprehensive independent commission of inquiry into all aspects of the usas war on terror detention and interrogation policies and practices is long overdue no agency should be exempt from scrutiny and no individual exempt from prosecution if the evidence supports it
7397625 the administrations words alone that it will remain wedded to human rights and the rule of law even as it wages its war on terror are no longer to be believed
7397626 it must show such commitment by its actions and change course fully in line with international law and standards
7397627 along with the individual detainees and their families the rule of law is falling victim to this disdain for the judiciary
7397628 the example being set by guant namo is of a world where basic human rights are negotiable and where arbitrary detention and selective second class justice become acceptable in the name of security
7397629 the aliens can not reveal anything about anyones life that would not be known without the use of our technology the exception being that if a reader has a question about his or her health and the assistance of alien technology would be necessary to answer that question
7397630 aliens will not threaten humans and humans will not threaten aliens
7397631 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world
7397632 if we as a group can get past the jealous rantings of the men we love and respect this country has a chance
7397633 just recently weve been able to distinguish the symptoms of early stage ovarian cancer from seemingly benign symptoms many women experience from time to time
7397634 we all have some of these symptoms from time to time
7397635 but if there is a symptom that is new for you or it persists for more than a couple of weeks we recommend you go to your doctor odds are it wont be cancer but it is worth having it checked just in case
7397636 we now have an evidenced based statement that these symptoms are predictive of ovarian cancer
7397637 one study conducted in 2000 showed that a significant percentage of ovarian cancer patients were wrongly diagnosed with other conditions prior to their diagnosis of ovarian cancer
7397638 people are so worried about insulting their doctor its no different than getting a job done in your house youd get more than one bid wouldnt you
7397639 the aliens can not reveal anything about anyones life that would not be known without the use of our technology the exception being that if a reader has a question about his or her health and the assistance of alien technology would be necessary to answer that question
7397640 aliens will not threaten humans and humans will not threaten aliens
7397641 bradley effect in fact your mention of it has inspired my blog write today so thank you might as well continue with this subject since it is of utmost importance
7397642 bradley wins oops he lost by 50 000 votes it just so happens that all of those voters who said they were going to vote for him at the last minute yep while they were in the booth
7397643 when they got in the voting booth they voted on issues instead of melanin
7397644 white progressive would support obama because as a black man he could not possibly have anything over white mccain
7397645 actually i espouse the idea that because obama is in his 40s and has only served approximately 6 month in any federal office he is less experienced than mccain
7397646 tell me who you run with and ill tell you who you are

7397657 met veel plezier kijken wij terug op de met u gemaakte wandeling in het westerpark op 3 juni j l ter gelegenheid van onze partnerschapsregistratie eerder die ochtend vonden wij het een leuk idee om samen met onze getuigen en mijn moeder een wandeling met gids te maken door het westerpark al enige tijd eerder had ik een artikel in het streekblad gelezen over de combinatie wandelen in het westerpark of buytenpark met een lunch of diner in hoeve kromwijk dit sprak mij zeer aan dat het zo leuk was hadden we niet van te voren kunnen bedenken we hebben genoten van een wandeling van 1 1 2 uur in een rustig tempo met voldoende tijd voor uitleg van de verschillende soorten flora en fauna het geheel in een zeer ontspannen sfeer en met verve begeleid dat wij als eerste gezelschap deze kromwijk route hebben gedaan maakt het extra bijzonder vanuit het westerpark is hoeve kromwijk om de hoek aansluitend hebben we dan ook genoten van een uitgebreide luxe 3 gangen lunch zeer prettige bediening in een aangename ambiance kortom voor ons en ik spreek ook namens onze gasten een geweldige leuke huwelijksdag nogmaals onze dank daarvoor
7397658 ooit begonnen als vuilnisbelt nu een prachtig natuurgebied het buytenpark
7397659 van mijn 2e tot 18e jaar woonde ik vlak bij het buytenpark toen was ik al gefascineerd door die ene hoge belt tussen ayers rock en de intratuin regelmatig pakte ik mijn fiets om een sprint naar boven te maken en daar te genieten van het uitzicht tien jaar later weer terug in hetzelfde huis vlak bij het buytenpark en wat is er van geworden een prachtig natuurgebied met rondlopend wild de galloway runderen wilde schapen en paarden lopen er vrij rond en weer maak ik datzelfde sprintje de heuvels op en geniet ik van het uitzicht de rust en tegelijkertijd de geluiden van de dieren dat wilde ik met meer mensen delen en ik besloot een familiedag te organiseren met rob wiewel als begeleider op zondag 25 mei was het zover een wandeling van 1 5 uur zowel voor volwassenen als kinderen wist rob er een feestje van te maken met interessante verhalen over de natuur rob bedankt we hebben genoten
7397660 op zaterdag 7 juli mocht ik voor mijn 9de verjaardag mijn partijtje geven voor 7 vriendinnen en vrienden boswachter rob stond ons bij boerderij geertje op te wachten en iedereen vond hem er als een echte boswachter uitzien de rondleiding door het prielenbos was erg leuk en leerzaam we vonden het echt geweldig dat we jonge padden en kikkers mogen vangen echt cool was dat we een dode pad mochten vasthouden we hadden een speciaal potje met vergrootglas meegenomen dus konden we ze heel goed bestuderen en leerden heel veel van de mooie verhalen van boswachter rob e n vriend zei aan het einde van de tocht dat hij vandaag heel veel nieuwe dingen geleerd had die hij nog niet wist een heel mooi compliment dus mijn vader en moeder hebben er van genoten om iedereen zo bezig te zien met en gefasineerd te zien raken door de natuur ze vonden het zelf trouwens ook erg leuk om zon prachtig stukje natuur zo vlak bij onze woonplaats leiden te zien de maandag erna hebben we op school het er weer met elkaar over gehad iedereen vond het geweldig en cool o ja ook nog erg bedankt voor het kleine presentje
7397661 onze gasten waren erg enthousiast over de hele organisatie de excursie vonden ze erg leuk ook dat mensen stil waren om naar jouw verhaal te luisteren was opvallend werd als prettig ervaren voor een aantal zoetermeerders heb je een verrassende blik op hun park gegeven heel erg bedankt nogmaals voor je excursie
7397662 de kinderen hebben het erg leuk gevonden en veel nieuwe dingen gehoord bedankt voor de leuke wandelingen en inderdaad het uur was omgevlogen 1 5 uur was nog leuker geweest maar ja dan hadden we niet zoveel kinderen kunnen herbergen ik denk dat dit zeker voor herhaling vatbaar is
7397663 we hebben gisteren genoten van de natuurwandeling door het prielenbos ter gelegenheid van ons dertigjarig huwelijksfeest
7397664 wat een prachtig stukje nederland wat een mooi stuk jong bos de wandeling door het prielenbos was heel bijzonder zo ongerept en de rust midden in het westen van nederland perfect de anekdotes en informatie die werden gegeven was ook erg leuk en interessant voor iedereen had de wandeling nog wel langer mogen duren zo ontspannend was het wij zullen dit zeker aanbevelen aan vrienden en kennissen
7397665 maandag 4 juni gingen 10 leerlingen van groep 6 7 8 van effatha basisschool voor dove en slechthorende kinderen op de fiets naar een kampeerboerderij in leiden onderweg stopten ze bij het prielebos bij boerderij het geertje stond boswachter rob op hen te wachten hij was duidelijk herkenbaar aan zijn groene kleding de kinderen hebben aandachtig naar zijn verhaal gekeken ze vonden het leuk dat ze met kleefkruid mochten gooien op de kleding van boswachter rob ook vonden ze het leuk dat ze pitriet mochten schillen waardoor er een heel zacht licht en wit sliertje te voorschijn kwam een leerzame natuurexcursie en een goede start van hun kampweek
7397666 namens onze rangers hartelijk dank voor de rondleiding door het buytenpark ze hebben thuis hele enthousiaste verhalen verteld aan hun ouders tot de volgende rondleiding maar weer
7397667 vanmiddag hebben we een zeer leuke interessante en gezellige middag beleefd dankzij jouw goed georganiseerde natuurexcursie bij het prielenbos ondanks de drukkende warmte was het erg leuk en hadden we er nauwelijks last van de anderhalf uur was eigenlijk veel te snel voorbij we hebben veel geleerd van je uitleg over het prachtige stukje natuur wat eigenlijk heel dicht bij huis boskoop is super gedaan bedankt
7397668 hallo boswachter rob ik vond de excursie heel leuk maar ik heb nog geen museum groetjes rik cortjens
7397669 hoe zien de schoppen van een mol er uit hoe voelt een dode pad of wat weegt een stuk veen van 150 jaar oud tijdens onze vrijgezellendag met 7 dames en boswachter rob de enige man die dag toegestaan hebben we genoten van een prachtig natuurgebied strand veen en het prielenbos daags voor de bruiloft was dit een zeer ontspannen maar toch sportieve en fascinerende dag voor de aanstaande bruid en uiteraard niet alleen voor de bruid ook voor de vriendinnen was dit een leuke natuurervaring heel hartelijk dank hiervoor
7397670 de laatste wandeling was in het westerpark eerst zijn we in het knekelbosje een bosje met allemaal schedeltjes geweest jammer genoeg vonden we geen schedeltjes maar we hebben wel het judasoor gezien dat is een paddenstoel boswachter rob zei dat we in januari terug zouden komen om naar schedeltjes en botjes te zoeken daarna zijn we naar een konijnenveldje geweest waar meestal konijnen zitten op de heenweg hebben we helaas geen konijnen gezien een eindje verder was het spookbos boswachter rob noemt het zo omdat als het waait de takken tegen elkaar ritselen we liepen toen vlakbij de rijks weg het was niet stil daar boswachter rob zei we gaan een expiriment doen nu is het geluid 100 als we straks weer luisteren moet je zeggen wat je het dan vind en waarom het komt dat het zachter is even later vroeg boswachter rob aan mij wat vind je het nu en waarom komt dat het klinkt zachter omdat we verder van de rijks weg zijn en omdat de bomen er voor zorgen dat het zachter klinkt zei ik toen zei boswachter rob een applausje voor lotte op de terugweg hebben sommige kinderen wel 5 konijnen gezien het was heel erg leuk volgende keer moet jij ook mee
7397671 blijf daar af doe dit niet doe dat niet nee jeffrey hou daar eens mee op niet aankomen heb ik toch gezegd

7397691 wat wil je hier je hoort hier niet niet echt jij bent gewoon een nederlander een fries zo je wilt met kennis van de zweedse taal niks meer vooral niks minder waarom wil je dit
7397692 hey dude i just heard this rap song that sounds like you
7397693 if you talk to warren buffett hell tell you his preference is not to meddle in the economy at all let the market work however way its going to work and then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
7397694 that way youre not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end
7397695 i do think that what the argument may miss is the sense of control that we want individuals to have in determining their own career paths making their own life choices and so forth and i also think you want to instill that sense of self reliance and that what you do will help determine outcomes
7397696 i picked up three foreigners who had to go to a sports event stadium at the other end of the city they were late already and i drove like the devil to get them there in time when we arrived the roads around the stadium had been closed off so i had to drive around for some time to find out how to reach the entrance the fare was 90 yuan 9 euros instead of appreciating what i did to get them there in time they shouted 90 yuan come on man you think we dont know that you cheated us by driving about we only give you 50 yuan for us 40 yuan is not little money
7397697 but its nothing for them each night they drink lots of beer for 30 yuan per beaker
7397698 they told me i was going the wrong direction and forced me to change lanes at a cross section i got a 200 yuan fine my passengers left me with the policeman and took another taxi
7397699 euro 2008 das finale im espace suisse in abidjan c te divoire
7397700 zur ckblickend kann ich von einer rundum perfekten woche sprechen nicht nur was das ergebnis angeht sondern auch das drumherum war sehr gut zun chst erstmal gibt es den trainingsfleiss der spieler hervorzuheben dann die umsetzung der taktischen anweisungen was mir jedoch am wichtigsten erscheint ist der eindruck dass die spieler viele dinge annehmen und versuchen umzusetzen
7397701 die eigentlichen abl ufe im trainingslager selbst unterscheiden sich nicht wesentlich von denen europ ischer teams
7397702 mit stielike seiner disziplin die er uns vermittelt seiner art und weise damit k nnen wir 2010 zur wm sogar die deutschen schlagen
7397703 seine art und weise wie er mit uns umgeht und die disziplin bringen der mannschaft unheimlich viel
7397704 die elfenbeink ste und ulrich stielike auf den zweiten blick
7397705 es sei eine ehre f r ihn f r die elfenbeink ste zu spielen und ein traum geht in erf llung
7397706 ich bin bereits zufrieden mein erstes tor f r die mannschaft geschossen zu haben das war wichtig f r mich f r mich als st rmer aber meine situation ist schwierig wie jeder weiss das frustriert aber f r die gruppe muss man manchmal frust ertragen ich will spielen ich habe deswegen bereits mit dem trainer gesprochen im club werder bremen anm des red spiele ich mit einem spieler der den selben stiel wie didier drogba spielt im zusammenspiel mit ihm habe ich dort bereits viele tore geschossen das heisst ein zusammenspiel mit didier drogba bereitet mir keine probleme zusammenfassend l sst sich sagen mir geht es gut und ich f hle mich in der gruppe wohl
7397707 ich f hle mich wohl ich glaube die afrikameisterschaft befindet sich auf einem hohen niveau viele gute mannschaften eine menge talentierte spieler es freut mich wirklich diese erfahrung zu machen fr her habe ich die afrikameisterschaft als zuschauer gesehen heute bin ich teil von ihr das ist fantastisch
7397708 ich m chte mali nicht nachdem beurteilen was ich w hrend des spiels auf dem feld gesehen habe im verlauf des spieles konnte ich nicht viele schw chen ausmachen aber die elfenbeink ste war einfach um klassen besser wir haben das spiel beherrscht selbst wenn seydou keita der beste spieler des spiels war
7397709 wie der trainer immer sagt ohne respektlos vor den anderen mannschaften zu sein nur wir z hlen
7397710 ich weiss es nicht die elfenbeink ste bringt viele gute spieler hervor jeder bei uns will st rmer werden ausser marc zoro marc libero lachen im saal anm des red aber selbst zoro marc hat ein tor geschossen schon da sieht man die qualit t unserer mannschaft zu meiner aufstellung in den n chsten spielen es gibt keine versprechen im fussball alle 23 spieler sind mit der intention gekommen zu spielen das ist doch klar wir respektieren die getroffene wahl des trainers anm des red jeder gibt sein maximum der druck auf die stammspieler w chst und wir die reservespieler anm des red geben unser bestes sie zu unterst tzen selbst wenn wir erst 15 oder 5 minuten vor spielende eingewechselt werden ich hatte die m glichkeit mich zu pr sentieren es ist jetzt am trainer zu entscheiden wer spielt oder wer auf der bank bleibt

7397717 ik wilde vrijwilligerswerk doen toen ik me aan het ori nteren was kwam ik erachter dat in harderwijk nog niet wordt voorgelezen aan allochtone kinderen elders in het land gebeurt dat wel
7397718 vooral hoe kinderen erop reageren je ziet dat ze nu zelf ook wel eens een boekje pakken
7397719 het gaat er vooral om dat ze lezen leuk vinden en in aanraking komen met nederlandse boeken en daardoor zelf ook gaan lezen

7397743 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
7397744 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh
7397745 arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan

7397747 i do not know brangelina and do not mean to personally impugn them as they might be good people in the flesh but the medias images of them are smelly and vile and i must always attack the medias representation of what is good or cool because those who inhabit the media world of glamour and entertainment and fashion and gossip are horrid people who have no talent of any kind and yet think of themselves as tastemakers taste my sandy buttcrack tmz and perez

7397752 the agency lacks the budget the statutory authority and the scientific expertise to ensure the hundreds of nanoproducts now on the market are safe
7397753 this problem will only worsen as more sophisticated nanotechnology based products begin to enter the consumer market
7397754 during the fall of 2007 many americans faced a hazard in their products that had been banned for 30 years lead
7397755 the cpsc the agency primarily responsible for the oversight of these toys was stretched too thin from years of neglect underfunding and the challenges posed by an increasingly global manufacturing system
7397756 it is against this background that we need to ask the question is the cpsc adequately prepared to deal with nanotechnology
7397757 it took decades of research before lawmakers found the political will to keep lead and phthalates out of toys
7397758 it could take a very long time to research and ensure that potentially dangerous nanomaterials are kept out too
7397759 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7397760 it was my six days of being well it was like a trance it was so wonderful it was so great to be with my daughter again
7397761 you know i lost i lost big time in boston
7397762 in light of mr gerhartsreiters history of deceitful behavior any statements made by him should be viewed with extreme skepticism
7397763 i like it hot its better that way dont you know anything dumbass
7397764 my neck really hurts is there something wrong with it
7397765 series and i dont have immediate access to book 4 so ive had to wait in the meantime ive had a stack of library books to choose from and ive tried to get into them but for an entire week
7397766 how many times is hakuna matata said in the lion king
7397767 thank you great spirit for the gift of laughter for the people who bring me joy for the comedy that makes me forget if only for a moment thank you fot the gift of creativity for artist whose work takes me out of the sadness and into a kinder place thank you for the gift of compassion and the joy of forgiveness

7397770 because you love them and theyre your friends you lay the shit out on the table for them to see it but you let them sort the shit out themselves
7397771 those people are laughing they must be talking about me
7397772 the boss wants to see me it must be bad
7397773 its like the riddle of the sphinx why are there so many great unmarried women and no great unmarried men
7397774 caches of supplies that could be used by violent demonstrators
7397775 while most of the activity will be peaceful and take place in the city of denver past practices of demonstrators show that they will use outlying buildings homes camping facilities secluded woods and farm field to store their supplies
7397776 information concerning the camping boarding or housing of potential violent protesters that have rented campaign spaces rented farms or land for the time period around the dnc
7397777 frequently used by violent protester sic to plan direct actions against conventioneers
7397778 we showed up at the facility unannounced today the doors were wide open and we managed to shoot for several minutes until a denver sheriffs captain asked us to leave
7397779 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7397780 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
7397781 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7397782 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
7397783 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7397784 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7397785 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7397786 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community

7397797 in fact those lyrics by bob dylan couldn t have been any closer because if you view yourself as a breathe machine which is not much different from the universal wind then the answer is certainly blowing in the wind and blowing within yourself
7397798 staid ome from skool mite have mild atak of the flew
7397799 we are the change we wish to see in the world
7397800 the affect of change will arise on the planet directly proportional to our awareness that we are all responsible as a you see everything is in
7397801 that wont come out until the accident investigation is concluded
7397802 in order to get things like that you need to go through the proper channels
7397803 im not the person whos going to give it to you thats just the way its going to be
7397804 i do know we lost a lot of business because of the accident
7397805 we are hoping all the best for bubba and the rest of them
7397806 if your not with the one you love you love the one your with
7397807 i saw one along the side of the road near mount washington about 25 years ago
7397808 it just hit me theyre wild and free and they do what they want and go where they want the majestic
7397809 we dont see too many moose back home they dont like saltwater
7397810 kita harapkan warga masyarakat nias di perantauan untuk ikut perhatikan pembangunan di nisel termasuk untuk menciptakan suasana kondusif di daerah itu karena tanpa didukung kebersamaan dan suasana kondusif maka pembangunan yang sedang giat digalakkan di sana akan mengalami hambatan kita melihat nias selatan cukup potensial baik dari segi pariwisata budaya dan ekonomi perikanan untuk menunjang kehidupan warga masyarakatnya
7397811 i remember there was a dance marathon at the bedford zoo and the orchestra that played there came to our house afterward
7397812 they had an accordion player named cesar mazzioli and he played in our home
7397813 tony and eleanor wanted to know if they could take lessons
7397814 so i said if theyre going to play can we play too
7397815 there wasnt a lot of money in the house to buy five accordions in 1935 but our parents said yes
7397816 we drove to boston on route 28 in a big old oakland
7397817 mr netsch the blacksmith on the west side he made a roof rack so we could store our accordions on top and we could all fit in the car
7397818 mr gaviani wanted gene to teach for him so he did but then he opened his own school
7397819 but i had enough students who would come with me so i left mr gaviani and opened the donati accordion school
7397820 we were right above the old puritan arthur pappas was our landlord
7397821 i remember they had a slogan off the rocks with landon and knox
7397822 we played as the donati quintet all five of us
7397823 and it came out of that appearance when wmur first went on the air
7397824 he was from newport but he had been very well known in vaudeville
7397825 it was a song called i have the chocolate ice cream blues
7397826 i left on aug 25 i was in the army medical corps just before we left virginia we were going to iran but it was called persia then one of the guys in my unit found out i played the accordion he told me i should have it shipped so i could bring it with me
7397827 and almost any evening he can be found with his accordion playing for patients hes about the most popular man in his unit
7397828 we were invited to appear on ted macks show and on major bowes amateur hour
7397829 but the accordion had to take a back seat to the family business
7397830 you were never designed to bear the burden of your own provision
7397831 let us make human beings in our image to be like us they will reign over the fish in the sea the birds in the sky the livestock all the wild animals on the earth and the small animals that scurry along the ground
7397832 be fruitful and multiply fill the earth and govern it reign over the fish in the sea the birds in the sky and all the animals that scurry along the ground
7397833 look i have given you every seed bearing plant throughout the earth and all the fruit trees for your food 30 and i have given every green plant as food for all the wild animals the birds in the sky and the small animals that scurry along the ground everything that has life
7397834 the lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden to work it and take care of it
7397835 the states on the floor are the states in play
7397836 people are very enthusiastic and really want to be here because its history and they want to be a part of it
7397837 knowing what hes been through and all the health challenges hes had i was crying
7397838 going out of my head trying to find something to do
7397839 ive almost died so many times ive wondered why im still here
7397840 i think this completes my circle now i can consider myself whole
7397841 the fact that hes been there he can understand the lack of intimacy the lack of privacy the things that go on in prison
7397842 hes a hard worker who really wants to make a difference
7397843 first of all the issue that hes dealing with in helping the incarcerated and teaching them how to integrate into society is a major issue affecting america
7397844 there arent a lot of people lining up to do the kind of volunteer work roger does
7397845 hes been through some tough times and now hes giving back to his community
7397846 in our community there are people who in the witness of their daily lives are highly valued role models
7397847 they are quiet people who proceed with ordinary daily lives and their neighbors are mostly ignorant of their history
7397848 collins spends 15 hours per week teaching counseling and preparing material for the program he openly and honestly shares the details of his past life his struggle with drugs and alcohol his personal failures and his recovery with the inmates in this program
7397849 he is not boastful or proud in his presentation and he presents his story with great humility and is a living example to the inmates that recovery can and does happen
7397850 i just wanted to get out of the cell and off the block
7397851 but once i got to know what the program was really about i got more interested
7397852 roger was very inspirational he went through his own personal struggles and he came through on the other side and inspired me
7397853 a light will sort of go on in a guys eyes and you see it and you say i got another one
7397854 if you asked me six months ago i would say it was sectarian
7397855 now i assure you its not they just feel better living in our big houses
7397856 as posi es sexuais t m import ncia mas a atitude mental o que mais importa pois se as pessoas se entregam de verdade numa rela o sexual seus corpos naturalmente assumir o a posi o correta
7397857 theres a lot weve done in terms of writing in district over the summer
7397858 our goal is for bedford students to be as good at writing as they are at reading and math
7397859 they have improved somewhat over the years relative to our peers but i think bedford expects to be as strong as any district in the state in writing and were not
7397860 i have been there for a growing economy and putting more money in peoples pockets
7397861 will go to washington and do the things that are going to help small business owners and working families
7397862 i want to focus on results not partisan rhetoric and not gamesmanship
7397863 big spending big government programs with no emphasis on making sure that our ability to live free or die is respected in the past six years weve seen six trillion dollars of deficit spending im the only one in this race that represents real meaningful change
7397864 i have watched our country get taken over by people in congress who are not looking out for the interests of the citizens of this country collectively we have a group of people whose priorities are getting reelected and increasing their power
7397865 i dont have a political bone in my body we need people in congress who actually want to do what is best for the country
7397866 found that i did not have a place in the democratic party i found there is more of a place in the republican party for someone who supports universal health care than there is in the democratic party for one who is even remotely pro life
7397867 by saying that we cant have universal health care put themselves behind the eight ball
7397868 im really concerned about the fact that congress is on vacation now rather than being in washington and rolling up their sleeves
7397869 we have got to change course produce more oil and natural gas and take another look at nuclear energy build more refineries and encourage renewable energy
7397870 i challenge anyone to tell me one significant accomplishment of the department of energy in the last 30 years
7397871 we need to start drilling for oil wherever there is oil and the way to do it is to put all the reasonable controls we can on protecting the environment and then we press on
7397872 unless there is a compelling reason not to drill we ought to drill
7397873 were in the situation were in today because representatives like jeb bradley and carol shea porter have continuously said no to energy exploration in the united states
7397874 instead of arguing and bickering should get in a room and get the job done and come up with a unified plan we need new faces we need new people down there
7397875 100 percent political the yucca mountain repository needs to be funded and completed
7397876 we never should have gone in there to begin with but the iraqis have now had five years to get their act together we have to put in place a plan that will get us out of there in two years its not a deadline im calling it a plan
7397877 in a minority of people who believe the potential for war with iran was always the primary catalyst that caused energy prices to skyrocket
7397878 forced this administration to deal with the iraq situation we gained the upper hand in terms of a diplomatic effort once we showed we were willing to stay in iraq
7397879 i dont think politicians in washington can choose to lose in iraq and should not be asking brave young men and women to go into harms way and not pay funding and benefits
7397880 we need to pay attention to our commanders on the battlefield but also make sure we are protecting our country and national security and continuing to win this war against terror
7397881 the federal income tax puts far too much burden on a small percentage of the taxpayers of this country
7397882 trying to find a way to pay for it by cutting unnecessary subsidies
7397883 if we can put every spending request in a separate bill that gets voted up or down by every congressman then the public is involved in the process and the taxpayers are going to feel that their congressmen are at least attempting to be more public and are representing them
7397884 if we dont draw the line somewhere its only going to be worse when the day of reckoning comes
7397885 you let me at the federal budget for a week and i guarantee you i can find billions of dollars in waste
7397886 we have to bail out certain companies and banks but only if they are absolutely crucial to the economy

7397893 hes been in the top 10 in many categories in the international league and i figured his time was coming soon
7397894 i first learned about it on the detroit web site and later i got a call from chris
7397895 for a while he was wondering when hed get a call up and i kept telling him it would be a matter of time
7397896 his time has come and were all nervously excited and hoping he makes the best of it
7397897 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks and planting doubts about people we have to make sure that we keep focused on peoples day to day concerns
7397898 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
7397899 any series we have with new york is going to be a big series but when we come off of a win like this i feel like everyone will show up and just have a little more energy and be able to feed off this game
7397900 one of the funnest games ive been a part of in a long time
7397901 weve got a day to regroup and we probably need to
7397902 a few of us were talking that its probably a lot bigger than just a regular win given the way the blue jays are playing and that theyre trying to catch up to us
7397903 he continues to impact the game and well take it we need it
7397904 hes stepped in and been a valuable member of our ballclub
7397905 the minute you make a mistake vernon wells hits it 400 feet
7397906 looked like he just got done with a 15 round fight
7397907 the fact that ellsbury stayed in and played that game it might be a little over dramatic but i thought he grew up a little bit today
7397908 he understood where we were physically with the rest of our team and what he can do by staying in the game i thought that was huge
7397909 i got up on the wall there and got up as high as i could and made the catch
7397910 its amazing what lights and a little paint job will do
7397911 for the last 20 years this facility has been good to us and the new hampshire indoor track league and this will bring it back to life
7397912 its going to go from an embarrassment to an asset
7397913 around here we believe that what you think you become
7397914 its hugely important for us to promote the right thing to do
7397915 if you feel good about a product youre more prompted to buy and we use this to create awareness for causes
7397916 i have definitely not had to try to sell them to teenagers
7397917 now they just have to teach the dumb s o b how to swim
7397918 when scorpio and pisces make a love match theirs is a splendid union of much respect and understanding
7397919 ya que se demostr que nunca estuvo en el lugar de los hechos
7397920 no es casual que hoy lo sentencien cuando el presidente y los gobernadores se re nen por el tema del secuestro seguramente pe a nieto escogi esta fecha para la sentencia para utilizarla pol ticamente a su favor diciendo que en el estado s se castiga a los secuestradores aunque ni nacho ni los dem s pobladores lo sean
7397921 de no contar con la solvencia econ mica se conmuta a cumplir una sentencia de 2 mil 850 d as de jornadas a favor de la comunidad
7397922 el expediente se sustentaba en acusaciones gen ricas desde el inicio del proceso apelamos del hecho de que era una acusaci n en paquete donde no se individualizaba la conducta de los acusados y eso va contra la ley as lo demostramos en los tribunales colegiados donde se logr exonerar a m s de un centenar de personas por qu si se absolvi a unos a otros no
7397923 el propio juez ha indicado a uno de los familiares que la sentencia no la dict l sino que se la mandaron del tribunal superior de justicia del estado de m xico lo que demuestra que se trata de una cuesti n eminentemente pol tica y no jur dica
7397924 falta la resoluci n final de la suprema corte y es la que debiera enderezar todas las anomal as que existen contra nuestros compa eros y de tanta gente
7397925 es inaplazable desmontar por completo el modelo de represi n contra las expresiones de disidencia social y pol tica en este sentido urge que las procuradurias estatales y la general de la rep blica procedan a archivar todos los procedimientos en que la acusaci n se base en el patr n represivo referido con anterioridad as como proceder a revisar la situaci n de privaci n de libertad de todos los presos pol ticos y de conciencia
7397926 las autoridades pol ticas y judiciales han puesto en evidencia la falta de voluntad y de capacidad para castigar a los responsables intelectuales y materiales de las grav simas violaciones de derechos humanos cometidas en el 2006

7397929 we care so much about the mentally ill we must destroy all access to voluntary services
7397930 het blijft een klein mirakel de geboorte van je eigen kindje ook de tweede keer ik ben apetrots op lily en op kristel natuurlijk bevallen is niet niks maar zowel lily als kristel verkeren in blakende gezondheid we willen nu in alle rust genieten van ons uitgebreide gezinnetje
7397931 ik heb hier 9 maanden naar uitgekeken en nu ligt onze kleine lily gewoon in mijn armen zalig ik kan mijn geluk niet op
7397932 oh you mean those kind of books i dont usually read those

7397942 als we naar onze twee geweldige dochters kijken kunnen we alleen maar concluderen dat we twee z r gelukkige mensen zijn
7397943 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7397944 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7397945 a rose by any other name would still smell as sweet

7397951 fans of heroes are avid entertainment enthusiasts who welcome the opportunity to stretch their own creative muscles by making a remix showcasing their favorite characters and moments from the second season
7397952 almost all year people have been talking about the olympics being a huge boost to online advertising and particularly online video advertising it has not been huge a huge boost and yet as a singular event yeah it has gotten pretty good results
7397953 their version wasnt compatible with some older versions of windows and macintosh and some people couldnt use it from behind firewalls meaning you lost the lunch time crowd who were trying to watch video from the office
7397954 the quality of the video player was excellent and is especially good for sports because you can fast forward or reverse and there are no glitches its a very seamless player
7397955 we have decided to build on our recent successes in the u s and focus on this market in making the shift we have decided to close our offices in both london and india
7397956 rnm was probably banking on a more sizeable u k audience
7397957 theres a reason for them to be and a place for ad funded video but there are a few things working against them in europe at the moment
7397958 mobile itself is still very much an emerging advertising platform ad agencies can get their heads round mobile banner ads probably a lot easier than they can mobile video advertising it will be a slow education of planners and buyers before they get round to mobile video
7397959 seize the momentum from the convention to bring millions of new voices into the political process
7397960 maybe they figure that theres enough earned media going on that they dont have to pay for anything
7397961 obama for president why not learn more about john mccain for president
7397962 at a minimum search engine ads make a lot of sense because this is the time when people are going online more than ever to find information about politics
7397963 thursday august 28th will be the biggest night of the campaign so far even if you cant be in denver you can be a part of this historic convention by attending a convention watch party in your area
7397964 i n terms of making the actual events more engaging theyre probably spending more time worrying about the timing of the balloon drop
7397965 all they need to do is put up a big banner behind the speakers each night saying join the conversation go to www democrats org or www rnc org and set up an interface to involve people in live chats by state or zipcode
7397966 the college fears that appropriate people may not be given it inappropriate people may be given it and the side effects may not be managed appropriately
7397967 and overall far more people will be given it which increases the risk of pregnancies especially if this is not properly screened for and then theres more abortions
7397968 we have evaluated matt through otas mini camp training camp and over the course of three preseason games after reviewing matts progress we feel like he has won the starting job
7397969 there were photographers there and i told them exactly where i was going to go i said right there make sure you wait for me there its just a positive attitude
7397970 they kept telling me push push push and i was pushing to the limit
7397971 that was fun a lot of fun oh my god this is awesome weve been close so often we never lost faith this is great for detroit
7397972 we would not have won this race if helio hadnt driven the wheels off it when he needed to we will keep going and see where we end up at the end of the year
7397973 i think our approach next weekend is the same we go for broke thats the only thing that is going to get us where we need to be
7397974 it was definitely a bad day we lost a ton of points
7397975 this is a race thats very tough unfortunately we got the bad end of the stick i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
7397976 i think if helio wins the next two races we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that
7397977 we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
7397978 im not upset with anybody particularly we just did absolutely nothing right
7397979 discovery was wrong to continue to rotate the new promos long after the debacle besides perpetuating a lie it showed a lack of professionalism so to say they didnt do anything wrong is in itself wrong
7397980 last minute decisions happen and regardless of what you think about it they made a professional choice
7397981 the originally scheduled new episode of mythbusters has been rescheduled
7397982 this is america pick a job and become the person who does it
7397983 he just said that he felt it was best to go the junior college route

7397985 ive been reading the papers and theyre saying all this stuff about me transferring for family reasons before coach tom crean even left

7397990 a lot of people forget how big these animals are
7397991 these are different creatures theyre not pets theyre production animals
7397992 part of the big deal of the fair is that it gives the public a chance to see these animals
7397993 remember that two horses or two oxen once took you all the way across america
7397994 they just dont understand what those big animals are capable of doing
7397995 i say to the men on tours id hate to call you a lady when youre not

7398024 delight thyself also in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart
7398025 in a western and elitist way we have viewed chinas right to its olympic games to its coming out its moment of glory with condescension and concessional tolerance
7398026 to believe that he will preserve us is indeed a means of preservation god will certainly preserve us and make a way of escape for us out of the temptation should we fall we are to pray for what god has already promised our requests are to be regulated by his promises and commands faith embraces the promises and so finds relief
7398027 isaiah 6 5 esv then we pray we confess we pray for god to grant us repentance much like the unknown puritan who wrote the follow prayer of confession

7398038 im tired of being what you want me to be feeling so faithless lost under the surface
7398039 it can free our consciousness from involvement in lower levels so that the spirit of god may more and more dominate his self awareness it can enable us to change from someone who is asleep to someone who is awake from a christian acting like an automatic robot to one celebrating his freedoms in christ jesus
7398040 esto puede liberar nuestra consciencia de involucrarse en niveles bajos para que as el esp ritu de dios pueda a n mas y mas dominar su auto conocimiento nos ayuda a cambiar de alguien que esta dormido a alguien que esta despierto de un cristiano que act a como un robot autom tico a uno que celebra su libertad en cristo jes s

7398047 the roads are being blocked by felling trees and attacks on christians have started
7398048 several church buildings are destroyed christian houses are torched and christians under attack
7398049 he was attacked by a mob and they were almost setting him on fire but the fire did not catch
7398050 by gods grace the police rescued him and have taken custody of him we are trying to get him released
7398051 we thank god that the government officials are protecting our campus and our people
7398052 and are on rampage to destroy several christian houses the condition may be same with other churches all over orissa
7398053 and now there is great tension prevailing and christians are running away for their lives
7398054 having ministered in orissa i can only imagine the plight of these tribal believers forced to run for their lives into the jungle
7398055 my heart goes out to the missionaries and believers we must pray with all earnestness for the suffering church in orissa at this time
7398056 these systems consistently finish at the top of the comparisons in many cases the gap between those three systems and the rest of the pack was significant in key adoption and brand metrics these three names showed not just strength but dominance
7398057 match the previous character if it occurs at least 1 times but no more than 5 times
7398058 but none of that applies to us we have no need for salvation because we dont have original sin we are the other people
7398059 let us make humanity in our own image in the likeness of ourselves and let them be masters of the fish of the sea the birds of heaven the cattle all the wild beasts and all the reptiles that crawl upon the earth
7398060 be fruitful multiply fill the earth and conquer it be masters of the fish of the sea the birds of heaven and all living animals on the earth
7398061 you may eat indeed of all the trees in the garden 2 17 nevertheless of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you are not to eat for on the day you eat of it you shall most surely die
7398062 did god really say you were not to eat from any of the trees in the garden
7398063 we may eat the fruit of the trees in the garden
7398064 but of the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden god said you must not eat it nor touch it under pain of death
7398065 god knows in fact that on the day you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods knowing good and evil
7398066 your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods knowing good and evil
7398067 i was afraid because i was naked so i hid
7398068 have you been eating of the tree i forbade you to eat
7398069 it was the woman you put with me she gave me the fruit and i ate it
7398070 on the day you eat of it you shall most surely die
7398071 no you will not die god knows in fact that on the day you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods knowing good and evil
7398072 see the man has become like one of us with his knowledge of good and evil he must not be allowed to stretch his hand out next and pick from the tree of life also and eat some and live forever
7398073 on the day you eat of it you shall most surely die
7398074 you must not behave as they do in egypt where once you lived you must not behave as they do in canaan where i am taking you you must not follow their laws
7398075 as a sign that you are truly free you shall be naked in your rites

7398111 keesiee binkhorst een voormalig off road instructeur is geweest en naar eigen zeggen zelfs onze toekomstige koning off road heeft leren rijden en er dus wel het fijne van af weet
7398112 als god had gewild dat vrouwen zouden vliegen was de hemel wel rose geweest
7398113 for i delivered to you as of first importance what i also received that
7398114 how did the sin of adam effect the human race
7398115 how did the sin of adam effect the human race
7398116 i will no longer talk much with you for the ruler of this world is coming he has no claim on me but i do as the father has commanded me so that the world may know that i love the father rise let us go from here
7398117 for there is no distinction for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god and are justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god put forward as a propitiation by his blood to be received by faith
7398118 the doctrine of the propitiation is precisely this that god so loved the objects of his wrath so much that he gave his own son to the end that he by his blood should make provision for the removal of his wrath
7398119 but because of his great love for us god who is rich in mercy made us alive with christ even when we were dead in transgressions it is by grace you have been saved and god raised us up with christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in christ jesus in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace expressed in his kindness to us in christ jesus
7398120 again if the trumpet does not sound a clear call who will get ready for battle
7398121 i take a lot of digital photographs just to extract color
7398122 acho que vamos precisar de uma bebida bem forte depois disso tudo
7398123 nos ltimos meses me tornei mais pessimista do que o consenso
7398124 a pior de todos os tempos desde a grande depress o
7398125 ou nacionalizam os bancos ou as hipotecas sen o todos estar o condenados
7398126 pessoas negligentes se iludiram que a crise era apenas dos subprimes
7398127 mas temos problemas com d vidas em cart es de cr ditos cr dito educativo leasing de autom veis empr stimos para compra de im veis comerciais empr stimos corporativos que financiaram a compra da empresa por um dos s cios
7398128 temos um sistema financeiro de subprimes n o um mercado imobili rio de subprimes
7398129 cerca de um ter o dos bancos regionais n o ir o resistir
7398130 nossos maiores financiadores s o a china a r ssia e os estados do golfo

7398133 a nation of counterfeiters capitalists con men and the making of the united states
7398134 was it weird not seeing peter and lauren in church today
7398135 in the evangelical movement young people are changing america and theyre changing the evangelical movement people dont want to go to church anymore and come out feeling bad because they happen to know somebody whos gay people want to go to church because they know what they can do about poverty about darfur about the environment
7398136 in terms of gay marriage i see it as a constitutional issue until we become a theocracy i think that judges should look at it from a constitutional issue whether i think homosexualitys wrong personally america is not gods country its not considered a christian nation anymore you have to look at everybody not just christians and say what are the rights of these people based on this constitution
7398137 i really felt like the republican party was taking advantage of the evangelical community by throwing us abortion and gay marriage really not giving the heart of christ more thought
7398138 i felt like it was the party of the extremely wealthy and they needed this conservative base in order to get a majority and so they pandered to us
7398139 what we have is christianity being represented by what is perceived as arrogance bullying an inability to negotiate peace an inability to listen people assume that christianity is that way you ask yourself what sort of person might god rise up to heal the wounds that have been created by that kind of positioning in the world you would think a very intelligent minority who came not out of wealth whos not only power position in washington d c a man whos more thoughtful in his answers and less bullyish not as simple of a thinker even as reality is not simple a man who has spent part of his upbringing overseas and has connections with kenya thats the guy a name like barack obama you just kind of go that would be the guy that god would choose to heal some of the wounds that weve caused in the world
7398140 take me there now so that i can touch it
7398141 this is so incredibly cool i am paddling in baja

7398150 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw veterans of foreign wars hall in concord and at the centre of an international crisis
7398151 to emphasise the competitive threat and in some senses the competitive opportunity that linux represents linux is a tough competitor theres no company called linux theres barely a linux road map yet linux sort of springs organically from the earth and it had you know the characteristics of communism that people love so very very much about it that is its free outlook express is free and also sometimes lets strangers share your hard disk is this anarchism ed and im not trying to make fun of it because its a real competitive issue today i would say we still dont see a lot of linux competition in most quarters on the desktop and we see a lot of linux competition in some server markets and we could either say hey linux is going to roll over the world but i dont see that happening thats not whats going on right now
7398152 go back into some of the isp markets and asp markets where linux has been historically strong and start to compete more successfully not on price not on the free nature of our stuff but as we get better development tools as we make it easier for people to debug their software as we have sort of a development approach that facilitates the applications that isps have been writing i think we have a real opportunity to if you will push back into some of the markets that have been real linux strongholds but linux has too with its free price point and the fact that it runs on the same hardware we do so we have no hardware advantage versus linux which we do tend to have with some of our other competitors it certainly is something very very much on our radar screen
7398153 working very very hard very very hard on new products
7398154 but there is certainly no downside risk in the consumer market the amount of revenue that we may get all looks like upside to me versus where we are today the same is largely true in small business
7398155 i have never felt better and ive never felt more nervous about something despite that fact in my career at microsoft when we launched net frankly i was saying will they like it will the dog buy this dog food will it make sense to people
7398156 mongoli is prachtig maar de eempolder is net zo mooi
7398157 op mn zestiende verjaardag kreeg ik een kleinbeeldcamera van mn vader het was winter ik zal nooit meer vergeten hoe het is begonnen hoe de kleuren waren de mist de kou hoe hard het licht was ik weet het allemaal nog heel precies het heeft werkelijk een traumatische indruk op me gemaakt het raakte een snaar bij me die nog niet zo geraakt was echt een ontdekking ik had het idee dat ik de elementen kon fotograferen
7398158 nou dat valt nogal mee want kijk wat je vastlegt dat ben jezelf dat is lles wat je fotografeert meer k n je niet fotograferen je kunt doen wat je wilt maar het is niet anders als je tien mensen naast elkaar zogenaamd dezelfde foto laat maken dan zijn dat nooit dezelfde fotos dat komt doordat elk mens onbewust zn eigen gedachten mentaliteit atmosfeer erin legt fotograferen komt van binnenuit
7398159 ja al meteen eigenlijk zoals het een goede amateur betaamt ha ha ha er hing een donkere paarsgrijze lucht boven de haven van ridderkerk het was zondagmorgen elf uur tweede kerstdag 1960 het had gevroren ik ging het ijs op ik weet nog hoe geel het riet was en hoe het uit het ijs kwam zetten dat was heel doorzichtig en had mooie plekken met van die witte bubbels echt een sprookjesparadijs
7398160 ach ik heb in mijn archief zon 80 000 beelden wat ik in 44 jaar heb weggegooid is ongeveer vijf keer zo veel maar van vrijwel alle dias die ik heb bewaard weet ik precies wat en waar het is ook al staat er geen plaats bij geschreven doordat je het bewust hebt beleefd weet je het nog
7398161 ik had de academie voor beeldende kunst gedaan en was eigenlijk tekenaar voor mijn werk zat ik alsmaar binnen ook als het mooi weer was dat vond ik vreselijk ik dacht ik wil eruit toen besloot ik van mijn hobby mijn beroep te maken in het gebouw van uitgeverij vnu had ik mn eerste expositie van natuurfotos dat leverde me meteen allerlei opdrachten op
7398162 bladen hadden in de jaren zeventig nog veel budget voor bijzondere fotoreportages bij een van mn eerste lange reizen naar hokkaido een eiland ten noorden van japan zei avenue hier heb je 10 000 gulden blijf maar veertien dagen weg en kom maar met een mooie reportage terug dat was natuurlijk geweldig maar dat komt nooit meer voor
7398163 niet bijzonder je moet eerder bedacht zijn op het onverwachte denk nooit ik fotografeer het straks of morgen wel daar kun je eeuwig spijt van hebben meteen fotograferen en in principe is alles interessant om gefotografeerd te worden elk moment van de dag op reis heb ik altijd zon vijftien kilo aan fotospullen bij me drie cameras twintig films en nog veel meer ik ben een snelschieter en laat me veel leiden door mn intu tie het is een groeiproces in korte tijd meestal zijn de laatste twee drie fotos ook de beste je danst er omheen ik fotografeer nagenoeg alleen met natuurlijk licht en zonder trucs standaard gebruik ik wel een warmfilter omdat ik films vaak wat koud vindt
7398164 het is mij niet te doen om het reizen ik wil gewoon fotos maken en niet lullen zou ik haast zeggen achterop mn visitekaartje staat photographer in search of his backyard als ik mijn eigen achtertuin niet meer interessant genoeg vind om een foto te maken dan ben ik ook niet in staat om een mooie foto in nieuw zeeland of zimbabwe te maken dat mag niet uitmaken dat is de opdracht aan mijzelf mongoli is prachtig maar de eempolder is net zo mooi er zijn veel plekken in nederland die gezien mogen worden
7398165 waarschijnlijk een wat eenzame perspectivisch gevormde foto met ergens een dier of een mens erin maar niet te nadrukkelijk n kleurrijk zo hoor ik het anderen wel omschrijven de elementen spelen daarbij altijd wel een rol ik streef er niet naar de dingen mooier voor te spiegelen dan ze zijn maar ik wil wel laten zien hoe mooi iets an sich is aan de natuur hoef je niks te verhapstukken je hoeft er alleen maar een bepaald deel uit te lichten de beste fotos voegen iets toe aan de realiteit een vervreemding
7398166 de noodzaak om geld te verdienen is altijd secundair in de eerste plaats wil ik graag iets cre ren dat gevoel is eigenlijk alleen maar heviger geworden ik werk me een slag in de rondte ik geef mezelf nog een jaar of tien als alles goed gaat dat is niet veel tijd meer om nog iets te ondernemen dus ik probeer heel veel in die tijd te persen ik heb het vreselijk druk het is niet dat ik nog zoveel niet gezien heb het is meer een gevoel dat ik heb en tot uitdrukking wil brengen zo ben ik nu ook bezig met boeken over bijzondere treinreizen en over nederlandse ongecultiveerde natuur de jungle om de hoek dat wil ik graag laten zien
7398167 het gaat om de v rbeelding en niet om de u tbeelding en dan kom je weer bij jezelf terecht dat blijft het enige waar je van uit kunt gaan veel mensen fotograferen als een kip zonder kop zonder wezenlijke aandacht voor hun onderwerp drukken maar wat af blijf niet staan waar je stond toen je op het idee van een foto kwam probeer verschillende standpunten loop eens wat rond zak door je knie n ga voor mijn part op de grond zitten maar begrijp dat je met verbeelding bezig bent gun jezelf ook wat betere apparatuur dat is de investering absoluut waard in vergelijking met een compactcamera geeft een spiegelreflexcamera zon voldoening
7398168 ik kreeg laatst een boek onder ogen van tim robinson een engelse schrijverfilosoof die zegt dat uiteindelijk niets meetbaar is oftewel afstand bestaat niet en tijd evenmin dat inspireert me ontzettend en dan kom je weer bij jezelf uit het is je verbeelding die iets maakt tot wat het is verbeelding is echt het grootste goed dat de mens gegeven is
7398169 dont underestimate the value of doing nothing of just going along listening to all the things you cant hear and not bothering
7398170 if ever there is tomorrow when were not together there is something you must always remember you are braver than you believe stronger than you seem and smarter than you think but the most important thing is even if were apart ill always be with you

7398348 a wall of ice coming towards us and then we were carried 200 metres
7398349 i was not completely submerged i managed to help the others
7398350 its probable according to statements made to us that the climbers roped together were on the path up the mountain and in the place where the block of ice tumbled down
7398351 it has been frustrating we almost hit the target but you dont get medals for close

7398357 we just have to focus on us just like weve been doing we cant focus on those kinds of things theyre intangibles that we cant control
7398358 every game right now is important to us were going to go to new york have a great time and hopefully take three
7398359 hes not been available for a week now and we have a day off today
7398360 id like to give him a chance to not do the dl but its always a possibility
7398361 its one of those things where you just try to play ive hit the wall before making my plays it was my shoulder that got the brunt of the wall its one of those things where you just dont want to do damage if you stay in to your shoulder you have to make a quick call over whether youre staying in or not
7398362 that was a minor one ive got a couple of scars from diving head first into the wall the only reason i had to come out then was i was knocked out ncaa rule was you have to come out i wanted to stay in
7398363 the last time we did that we got in trouble did it cross my mind sure id love to but we couldnt do that
7398364 the biggest thing is he just looks so patient and not unnerved
7398365 watch his at bats theres no panic there hes taking pitches that are just off the plate it looks like hes real comfortable and really secure within himself with what hes got to do up there
7398366 its nice to see him handle things so well especially being in boston and a pennant race hes not fazed by anything
7398367 obviously its a big thrill especially at this time of year
7398368 every win counts so much more right now it was a slider and leagues got good stuff he left a pitch over the plate and i was able to drive it out of the park
7398369 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7398370 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7398371 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7398372 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain
7398373 that message is going to echo clearly from this platform
7398374 sort of like us he obama comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care
7398375 the republican track record on national security has not been particularly good
7398376 my job in this campaign is to explain that talking tough and acting dumb is not a way to keep you safe and secure
7398377 we need somebody who talks tough whos going to act smart and be tough thats how were going to look after the safety of the american people
7398378 i dont think hes ready to be president and when youre commander in chief you shouldnt be having to select a mentor to help you with that role
7398379 they can see its not a huge problem some have even gone out on activities on tours or sand biking
7398380 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7398381 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7398382 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7398383 its not that theres anything wrong with the choice of joe biden a majority rate the biden selection as excellent or pretty good voters think he is qualified to be president and with the exception of al gore in 1992 the public ranks biden as the most qualified running mate in recent times
7398384 a lot of americans dont know who he is but his favorable rating is 13 points higher than his unfavorables but biden is not hillary clinton and its possible that is enough to have moved some of her supporters away from the democratic ticket at least temporarily
7398385 we have a great track record of bringing substance with splash
7398386 you expect people to respond by organizing a protest and throwing their fists in the air and you also expect people to respond by flying 1 000 american flags

7398444 making ground how have transformed teaching pedagogies taken advantage of participatory media to increase learner engagement
7398445 stated simply constructivist theory of learning holds that learners construct knowledge by understanding new information building on their current understanding and expertise knowledge is constructed by assimilating new information into the learners knowledge paradigm
7398446 learning is best served when it is contextual active and social
7398447 learning is strengthened through social interactions interpersonal relations and communication with others
7398448 a final grade does not measure the learning that did or did not take place
7398449 you know how einstein got bad grades as a kid well mine are even worse
7398450 the underlying theme remains the same however cultivating learning practices consistent with learning theory and aligned with the habits and expectations of net gen students and soon professors
7398451 youtube is part of a trend among net generation students to replace passive learning with active participation where everyone has a voice anyone can contribute and the value lies less in the content itself than in the networks of learners that form around content and support one another in learning goals
7398452 increase the understanding of teaching and learning power of technology

7398459 the burlington county freeholders agreed to purchase 400 acres of farmland having more than a mile of frontage on new jersey state highway 206 from property owners bf amp w realty llc for 4 8 milion dollars
7398460 county officials have not determined how much of the land would be resold but the the property is deed restricted so that it will remain a farm forever the size and prime location of this farm makes it a phenomenal acquisition for burlington county not only as a gateway property to the county farm belt but for the multiple benefits of watershed protection

7398463 the lord says see my servant will act wisely people will greatly honor and respect him many people were shocked when they saw him his appearance was so changed he did not look like a man his form was changed so much they could barely tell he was human but now he will surprise many nations kings will be amazed and shut their mouths they will see things they had not been told about him and they will understand things they had not heard who would have believed what we heard who saw the lords power in this he grew up like a small plant before the lord like a root growing in a dry land he had no special beauty or form to make us notice him there was nothing in his appearance to make us desire him he was hated and rejected by people he had much pain and suffering people would not even look at him he was hated and we didnt even notice him but he took our suffering on him and felt our pain for us we saw his suffering and thought god was punishing him but he was wounded for the wrong we did he was crushed for the evil we did the punishment which made us well was given to him and we are healed because of his wounds we all have wandered away like sheep each of us has gone his own way but the lord has put on him the punishment for all the evil we have done he was beaten down and punished but he didnt say a word he was like a lamb being led to be killed he was quiet as a sheep is quiet wheil its wool is being cut he never opened his mouth

7398486 china was eager to present something that shows it is a new power that has its own might

7398491 they have earned a tremendous amount of face because of the olympics
7398492 they are going to ride on that for a while we dont have a culture that is pro change china by nature has got to be provoked to make changes the economic reforms came about because we were desperately poor
7398493 for the chinese authorities to sentence them at all shows the governments insecurity and intolerance of even the most peaceful challenges to its authoritarian control
7398494 i would hope that we would look back at this as a major threshold of when china ditched all its baggage of the historical narrative of aggrieved nationalism
7398495 and just rewrote that narrative and began to act with more confidence about itself and its role in the world
7398496 i think that would make china and chinese become more tolerant and open

7398498 what were looking at is a fire sale of properties in newer affordable neighborhoods that were bought or refinanced near the price peak with lousy mortgages what were still not seeing is this level of distress spreading to more expensive or established neighborhoods
7398499 sales surge but real estate market is still in decline
7398500 the percentage of foreclosures and the mix of housing needs to be quite a bit smaller
7398501 that process is not in any way shape or form an indication of a return to stability a healthier housing market
7398502 for one thing theres a lot of inventory and interest rates are still low and that situation may not exist when the market begins turning
7398503 this isnt risk free but i dont care if home prices go down
7398504 thats definitely a weak link the job situation is always an issue
7398505 houses are becoming a little more affordable because prices have dropped 20 to 25 percent

7398537 we might easily think that hitlers genocidal ambitions were rooted entirely in his virulent anti semitism but mein kampf helps to reveal that they were merely one malevolent effect of a far deeper more profound and pervasive evil a
7398538 given the epic scale of their inhumanity we need to remember that the nazi regime did not purport to do evil it claimed to be scientific and progressive to do what hard reason demanded for the ultimate benefit of the human race the superhuman acts of inhumanity were carried out for the sake of humanity

7398561 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive

7398565 in the case of manually coded japanese i can understand just about 20 percent of what is being signed
7398566 i can feel at ease if we can enjoy service in jsl at hospitals for example
7398567 if sign language interpreters also have knowledge of jsl they can give translations that allow the deaf to understand better what is being talked about
7398568 middle aged people signing jsl find themselves not understood by the younger generations who are fluent in manually coded japanese
7398569 it is desirable that interpreters can switch between suitable kinds of sign language depending on the audience they are working for and choose expressions that they can understand
7398570 they can live a happy life even if they use only sign language
7398571 creating a school that allows children to study in sign language has been our hope for more than two decades

7398607 das kann ich jetzt nicht mehr franz m ntefering allein anlasten sondern auch frau merkel
7398608 denn in der cdu kritisiert man die parteivorsitzende nicht ffentlich
7398609 ich hatte mir das interview im spiegel gut berlegt die reaktionen einiger parteifreunde darauf fand ich berzogen sie zeigten aber wie sich einige festgefahren hatten was meine politische rolle angeht
7398610 wenn sich jemand nur auf seine amtsautorit t beruft dann werde ich schnell widerborstig ich hatte noch nie probleme damit autorit ten zu kritisieren das h ngt vielleicht auch mit meinem beruf zusammen daf r ist konfliktf higkeit und selbstbewusstes unabh ngiges auftreten eine grundvoraussetzung
7398611 dass ich als vorsitzender der mittelstandsvereinigung eine eigene politische meinung haben kann wollen einige nicht akzeptieren nun ist m glicherweise die phase der entspannung angebrochen
7398612 ausgeschlossen dass ich so agieren k nnte wie ich es tue
7398613 der fraktionsvorstand w rde mir doch den halben tag auf der pelle sitzen
7398614 auf mein recht zur freien rede w rde ich aber nie verzichten wollen
7398615 die cdu spitze hat eingesehen dass wir die b rgerliche mitte und damit auch den mittelstand brauchen
7398616 ich habe immer gesagt politik ist keine einbahnstra e wenn ich der partei helfen soll dass die b rgerliche mitte der union erhalten bleibt dann geht das nicht ohne gegenleistung
7398617 regeringen bakker op om den fundne l sning for roskilde bank vi havde selvf lgelig gerne set at der var kommet en privat k ber til banken men i den foreliggende alvorlige situation er den valgte l sning n dvendig for at afvikle bankens aktiviteter i god ro og orden
7398618 n r regeringen bakker op om den fundne l sning er det af hensyn til den finansielle stabilitet s rligt p et tidspunkt hvor der er uro p de finansielle markeder og danske pengeinstitutter er afh ngige af udenlandsk finansiering

7398620 es ist die sehnsucht der deutschen nach einem politiker mit charisma die diese werte erkl rt
7398621 200000 berliner sind nicht zur siegess ule gepilgert um zu h ren was obama da eigentlich sagt es ging darum wie er es sagt dass er einfach da ist und diese ausstrahlung hat dieses charisma was wir hier so vermissen man projiziert hoffnungen auf ihn
7398622 der charismatische obama weckt hoffnungen ja was wird aber geschehen wenn er einmal pr sident beispielsweise mehr soldaten von deutschland f r afghanistan fordert da k nnte die entt uschung gro sein
7398623 wirtschafts und au enpolitische kompetenzen spielen derzeit f r die deutschen offenbar keine rolle

7398652 if it means leaving our ministry to protect and love you our family we will do it in a heartbeat
7398653 we the leaders of the charismatic community have operated in an extremely low level of discernment frankly we often dont even try to discern we assume a persons credibility based on gifts charisma the size of their ministry or church whether they can prophesy or work a miracle etc miracles and signs are intended to validate god and his message not the messenger sometimes they validate the assignment of an individual but never the persons character lifestyle or spiritual maturity we leaders in the church have become no different than the world around us in our standards for measuring success and greatness this has contributed to the body of christ giving millions of dollars to undeserving individuals it has allowed people living in sin to become influential leaders even to lead movements allowing them influence all the way to the white house through our lack of discernment we built their stages and gave them their platforms we have been gullible beyond words gullible leaders producing gullible sheep

7398672 he said that it was strange that a people who were so loyal to their country as had been the union soldiers and their friends should not have been the first to inaugurate this beautiful ceremony and that it must be attributed to the fact that they were so engrossed in taking up their vocations in life that they had not had time to indulge in sentiment

7398684 at school no matter how people dress you know at lunchtime whos got money and who doesnt the rich kids walk off campus to get lunch at the fast food places and the poor kids stay on campus and eat mystery meat
7398685 in general darker drinks such as red wine and whiskey have higher levels of congeners impurities produced by the fermentation process or added to enhance flavor than do light colored drinks such as white wine gin and vodka the greater the congener content the uglier the morning
7398686 a woman who matches drinks with a man is going to get drunk faster than he partly because she has less body water than he does and less of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase which breaks down alcohol apparently your genes also have a vote as does your gene pool almost forty per cent of east asians have a variant less efficient form of aldehyde dehydrogenase another enzyme necessary for alcohol processing therefore they start showing signs of trouble after just a few sips they flush dramatically and they get drunk fast

7398694 get fucked up at his pad before we go to the club so we dont have to spend money at the club
7398695 lets go to the bar and drink where our parents wont be there and we wont have to spend money at the club but we wont get fucked up because we have to be sober enough to take ourselves home

7398697 earnings growth our data show has a strong effect on value creation and the effect becomes more pronounced over longer periods of time therefore the postmerger firms must throw themselves into preventing or offsetting the customer attrition often the result of diminished trust that usually follows a merger managers must devote sufficient resources to retaining current customers and gaining new ones

7398723 but that was very appropriate that that happened for him sunday because he does his work so professionally shows up every day ive never heard him complain about anything
7398724 it was another outing without his best stuff where he battled he kept us in a ballgame
7398725 he stayed away from one bad pitch one big inning so theres growth there
7398726 i was just looking for a fastball somewhere down the middle in
7398727 he got it in a little bit and i just put a good swing on it
7398728 its an unbelievable feeling theres nothing else that can beat that
7398729 id been on a rough stretch i just went up there relaxed and just tried to put a good at bat together i only saw two pitches but it was a good pitch to hit so i couldnt take it

7398734 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7398735 this could give you an almost infinite number of switches and options for communication
7398736 its easy and somebody could learn an entirely different language
7398737 left up could be turning lights on right down could be turning off the tv
7398738 you could control not just your chair your tv your computer but your entire life
7398739 this is a line that i probably shouldnt use in washington but i will when i came to the dnc we fired all the washington consultants because we paid all of them a lot of money to tell us how to lose every four years
7398740 governor deans advocacy of a bottom up people led internet based politics has utterly transformed the democratic party and today you have having taken that model to a completely different level giving him a financial advantage and a political advantage that weve never seen
7398741 the new york times made fun of me when i went to alaska three years ago
7398742 now here we are on the verge of picking up a senate seat and possibly even picking up alaskas three electoral votes so its astonishing what you can do when you show up in these places and pay attention to people
7398743 its aggressive its bold its exciting and its going take some time to work but youre starting to be able to feel like were not just a party of shrinking territory but expanding possibilities
7398744 we always had the volunteers we always had a very active group of democrats in arizona but we didnt really have the organizational skills to put it all together and that helped us
7398745 its something that some of us tried to do early on with state parties but that was before a lot of highly technological sophisticated databases and tools were available and i think howard has taken advantage of the advancement of those tools
7398746 in some respects im not as great an admirer of what gov dean has done
7398747 folks have been pushing around the rules committee and the dnc for a long time and we finally just said no were not doing it anymore and these are the consequences and were sticking to them
7398748 i think shell say all the things that need to be said
7398749 this is the new politics and its a generational change in american politics and the people who are supporting him and coming to all these rallies and raising all this money by and large are a new generation of people who want to do things differently
7398750 even if god forbid he doesnt win i think the change is going to be permanent because weve come so far by doing this
7398751 i think its great that the democrats chose colorado we are now officially a swing state a purple state
7398752 obama is running a very competitive campaign here so it gives us a chance to highlight western issues and it gives our presidential candidate a chance to speak to western voters not just in colorado but nevada new mexico and arizona as well
7398753 it was a very creative household to grow up in
7398754 the next congress will be an exciting one to be in particularly if we increase our majorities and get a democratic president well actually be able to start doing a lot of the things that the democrats have been running on for some time
7398755 theres frustration among our base that we havent delivered on these things we havent been in a position to it will shift to becoming our responsibility to deliver on the types of changes that were talking about and i look forward to working on the details of those so that we can get them successfully implemented
7398756 in marketing electronic alternatives are often framed as the green alternative to print because they dont require paper ink packaging and physical transportation however there is a lot more to ones environmental footprint than this take for example ones carbon footprint on this issue electronic alternatives with their massive 24 hour energy drain start to look less appealing
7398757 i wanted to deal with someone i could trust and someone i knew was interested in installing a major piece of equipment at a large university
7398758 it was evident from my first meeting with clyde tillman president of pressaccess that he was that individual
7398759 pressaccess located the right press for us in atlanta within just a few weeks
7398760 a new press would have cost twice what we paid for this used machine
7398761 we are strictly a one shift five day per week operation and could not justify the cost of a new press
7398762 we are printing faster and with better quality than ever before most four color process jobs with very large quantities were few and far between on our 29 inch press and many 40 inch jobs had to be printed off campus
7398763 we still print smaller jobs on our existing 29 inch press but longer runs from 5 000 to several hundred thousand pieces are reserved for the sm 102 thanks to pressaccess we now can keep more of that work in house and the volume of 40 inch jobs we handle is increasing
7398764 the new press already has been of huge benefit to the university
7398765 the company met all our expectations we were very satisfied not only with the installation but also with the way the company handled several issues after installation and after the warranty period had lapsed we anticipate that pressaccess will continue to be a reliable partner for us
7398766 when we learned that press access specializes in installations for universities we knew we wanted to work with them to handle the acquisition
7398767 the refurbished machine we purchased would have cost well over 1 million new we were able to buy more press for the money by purchasing used
7398768 pressaccess looked at our specs and found exactly what we needed at a printing plant in new zealand they also found a buyer for our old press in south america as part of the deal in our view pressaccess president clyde tillmans world travels provide access to a greater selection of equipment than the average vendor he certainly located the right press for our operation and whats amazing is that he did it within a week or so of our first conversation
7398769 it was a lucky day for us when we learned that pressaccess had experience with other university installations
7398770 pressaccess owner clyde tillman was very patient with us and our governing systems requirements and he helped us jump through all the hoops he stayed right in there with us the entire time
7398771 pressaccess has been ready and willing to provide whatever weve needed to make this work
7398772 we cant say enough about how knowledgeable helpful and professional pressaccess has been the expertise of mr tillman and his team certainly made a challenging process as easy as possible for us
7398773 with a durometer of approximately 62 shore a and resolution easily exceeding 200 lpi screen count the high ink compatibility and improved flexibility of nyloflex fab provides a much needed step forward in capability for the label market

7398775 stemming from highly automated systems and new material development our rotec hybrid sleeve will be able to serve the market better with this new type of fiberglass base

7398780 the graphic communication industry is looking to its industry associations to partner and create synergies based upon their distinctive competencies by bringing together the distinct work of ipa in the digital print forum and idealliance in color certification and specifications the industry can look to a unified program for digital press systems color certification
7398781 like in earlier ipa proofing roundups the results of this type of analysis helps business leaders make important purchase decisions and assists our vendor partners in understanding how their technologies are being applied in the marketplace this unified approach to examining emerging technologies and defining acceptable criteria for certification will well serve our members and industry

7398786 our company is unique in that we have two of the largest printing presses in the world in our facility
7398787 our new kba google rapida 205 81 inch sheetfed press gives us the additional capability of printing on substrates like plastic vinyl and styrene and allows us to service our customers with their entire large format printing needs weve found that there are very few printers who have this ability thus making us unique in the market
7398788 it was my six days of being well it was like a trance it was so wonderful it was so great to be with my daughter again
7398789 you know i lost i lost big time in boston
7398790 it would be mad to base too many judgements on the strength of just one match or even two
7398791 the league wont settle down until about christmas and it will be time to re evaluate things then if we stay strong we can stay in the running
7398792 weve got to assemble a team now and see where we are after the transfer window closes next week you must stay confident it is no good telling yourself you cant win this cant win that
7398793 given the right situations i think we will still do well there are a lot of teams who can do well this season and we hope we are one of them
7398794 if nothing else weve got to match uniteds work rate

7398796 i have a lot of respect for crouch and defoe
7398797 they are good players and will score a lot of goals this year especially at home
7398798 crouch is tall and wins most things in the air and defoe is very quick around the box he is a sharp player who makes problems for defenders
7398799 but as defenders we are here to deal with situations like that
7398800 we know who we are playing against so we need to prepare properly because it is very important we get the three points
7398801 we have started badly but it is a long season and we have plenty of time to put it right
7398802 it will not be easy tonight portsmouth will want to show they are not as bad as they looked last week but we will be ready
7398803 i am not saying portsmouth are bad but when it is one of the top teams the community shield is like a derby and you really want to win

7398851 the incident took place here so the witnesses should be heard in darjeeling itself its the governments ploy to shift the case to kurseong because it will be easier to transfer it to siliguri from there if the case is taken beyond kurseong the consequences will not be good
7398852 we will strongly resist such ploys of the government gjmm supporters in large numbers will go to kurseong to prevent such a thing we also appeal to the judiciary not to transfer the case to other places
7398853 i have a farmer tan and i havent been skate boarding therefore am i a farmer
7398854 unless we receive a guideline from the administration it will not be possible for us to maintain a register book and keep a detailed identity record of our internet users
7398855 if we had the official guidelines with us we could have requested our net users to bring photocopies of their identity cards with them we would not have to incur a huge expense on scanning
7398856 we have issued instructions to all the six police stations under our jurisdiction to submit us the details of the cafes in their areas and we hope to get them soon
7398857 for the time being the people are in desperate need of relief from poverty and hunger and the main responsibility to provide them with relief rests with this ministry
7398858 like the previous visit in may 2008 to india by a group of 16 senior officers of government of nepal this visit also is being organised by the government of india through the indian institute of public administration iipa new delhi a premier institute of india engaged in the training of civil servants
7398859 the visit has been arranged in response to a request from the government of nepal in the context of adoption of federal democracy as nepals future political structure the delegation will visit new delhi and the states of tamil nadu and pondicherry where it will meet senior government leaders parliamentarians and officials to get a close view of indias federal system in work along its various dimensions ranging from legislative to judicial administrative financial and developmental federalism
7398860 the delegation will also visit the lal bahadur shashtri national academy of administration at mussoorie which provides the foundation and mid career training for the civil servants of india
7398861 the visit of these senior officials is part of the on going initiative for visits to india by the officials of the government of nepal under the india nepal economic cooperation programme government of india will expand opportunities for study and exposure visits to the nepalese civil servants in various focus areas so as to further strengthen awareness of each others systems and reinforce the friendly professional and close relations that characterize the interaction between the civil servants of the two countries
7398862 thus through the youth wing we will intensify our programmes properly and smoothly in support of gorkhaland as well as avoid obstacles to create a better image of our politics to the people
7398863 the development work will be initiated very soon besides this an additional 50 beds in the maternity ward and the indoor facility for cardiology nephrology and radiology units will be implemented shortly
7398864 the identity crisis of the indian nepali community residing in the darjeeling hills is a real problem and even a demand for a separate homeland is not out of tune with the historical process of the region yet ethno political identity cannot be the be all and end all of human society
7398865 cultural and educational regeneration of a community has its own importance and this should not be relegated to the background under the overwhelming passion of ethnic consolidation
7398866 yet ethnic passion should not be allowed to obliterate the socio cultural and educational issues unfortunately this is what seems to be happening in the hills for some time
7398867 a handful of intellectuals springing up here and there most of them having settled outside would not help we need a number of social reformers to help in the total restructuring of the intellectual and cultural landscape of the hills
7398868 besides ethnic identity happens to be only one among the myriad identities that a human being irrespective of the particular community develops or is inclined to inculcate through conscious efforts
7398869 for a few days we will keep raja in complete isolation we will keep a close watch on its diet too this centre does not have complete veterinary care but we will have the surgeon from jaldapara checking it regularly
7398870 we strongly condemn the foreign ministers comment and demand that the union government first segregate and deport the illegal nepalese living in the darjeeling hills and only then consider the statehood demand if at all
7398871 prior to 1999 we used to sell idols on hill cart road kachhari road and the bidhan road area but the administration and the civic body requested us to shift to a centrally located place which we agreed to and kumartuli was set up in ward 4 of the siliguri municipal corporation nine years ago
7398872 more than 500 durga idols will soon be dispatched to different places in north bengal and hills as well
7398873 if there is incessant rain for two days the entire area is water logged we face tremendous difficulties to dry up the structure of idols made of bamboos and straws in the absence of a drainage system here
7398874 this year will not be a different from the past 10 years when we have been facing the same inconveniences
7398875 to narrow the gap between promise of our ideals and the reality of their time
7398876 we are our brothers keeper we are our sisters keeper
7398877 what is it called when people killed others and were then acquitted
7398878 what is it called when a school board spends 179 per white child and only spends 43 per non white child

7398996 weve known that but weve had trouble getting other people to know that
7398997 there is no question since weve adopted the flagship agenda that we have put a very high premium on quality

7399003 he wasnt in an offense that was highlighting the quarterback
7399004 but at the same time he took over the game i watched he didnt throw for a lot of yards he had a decent completion percentage but he won and he won in a manner that let me believe at that time that there was upside and potential for him to grow

7399019 how can councillors possibly justify 45 per cent increases in expenses and allowances and at the same time expect council workers to accept a 2 45 per cent below inflation pay offer
7399020 it is council workers not councillors who deliver hands on services to the people of westminster and they deserve to be treated better
7399021 it is totally inappropriate for councillors to vastly increase their own allowances at a time when taxpayers are struggling to make ends meet particularly in the current economic conditions councillors have a responsibility to reduce this bill
7399022 the increase in the allowances were set by the tories who run the council but the increase is considerable and i know there will be many people who feel rightly upset about the level of the increase very few people will have got such a huge rise in their salaries in the last two years
7399023 allowances are paid to members in westminster and other london councils based on the recommendations of an independent london wide panel last reported in 2006
7399024 he always enjoyed being out there whether it was just being a ball boy on the sidelines or at practice running around and throwing the ball with the players or other coaches kids
7399025 this competitions going to do nothing but benefit all of us
7399026 were working hard and were doing our thing were out there grinding were working hard absorbing all the information we can
7399027 you like to give him all the snaps you can give him
7399028 what we have to do is make him comfortable in some of the situations that we know were going to be in with him if we do that well be fine
7399029 through the trials that happen in football hes got a father whos very grounded and helps him along the way and tells him thats just part of life
7399030 it has a soul it has a story to tell
7399031 were like a foster home we take an item in clean it and take care of it until someone else comes in buys it and loves it

7399033 you dont have to fit this box that the store says is a size 4
7399034 when guests reuse a paper bag they receive 05 off their bill for each bag and if they have reusable bags they receive 10 off their total for each bag
7399035 a rope tied in a slip knot which binds closer the more it is drawn which historically has been used in execution by hanging and which symbolizes racism and intimidation
7399036 the flag is seen by some southerners simply as a symbol of southern pride but the flag is often used by racists to represent white domination of african americans
7399037 not just for my fans but for everyone else out there who hasnt heard of me but should be a fan
7399038 when i came into my role as treasurer i felt that student government at yale really should interact with the student body more it really should help the student body get their ideas put into place
7399039 when they want a change to the campus they usually want it immediately
7399040 you missed this fact you spelled this wrong you misattributed this quote
7399041 government is like a big baby an alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other
7399042 we would advise everyone in south tyneside to check their council tax band
7399043 between confusing revaluations council incompetence and human error there are probably a lot of people out there whove been paying too much and deserve a refund

7399047 these men and their exploits are named in 2 samuel 23
7399048 oh my there is a face under all that tape
7399049 its ridiculous the council makes these announcements and theres nothing you can do
7399050 the rubbish trucks can easily get down our road it just takes them a touch longer
7399051 its the councils job to collect our rubbish and our role as residents to pay for it we shouldnt have to help them do their job
7399052 if were not getting this service we should pay less council tax
7399053 if i were taken ill it would be a nightmare jill would not be able to drag the bin out on her own
7399054 it is highly dangerous to have bins clogging the entrance to roads driver visibility is reduced and pedestrians are forced into the street its an accident waiting to happen
7399055 were not prepared to go along with the new scheme but this could cause a problem if rubbish is left lying around
7399056 physically for me it is fine but it means i have a massive bank of wheelie bins on the path outside my house
7399057 the council tells people to take them back immediately but that isnt always feasible a lot of people who live here work at heathrow and are away for a few days at a time
7399058 were in the process of reviewing our collection procedures to make them more efficient
7399059 creating central collection points reduces the time spent by our operatives trying to manoeuvre either by vehicle or foot into areas that arent easy to access
7399060 as the number of houses in our area increase it becomes increasingly difficult to reach them all
7399061 we would have to increase council tax by about 3 per year to continue to offer a doorstep collection for everyone
7399062 its up to each council how it collects waste and recycling
7399063 some towns are full of terraces others have a lot of cul de sacs its about finding the most efficient solution councils have to make a decision based on whats most appropriate for the area
7399064 the sign portrays a small proportion of the older generation very few older people are hunched over with a walking stick they are assuming everyone who is old looks like that and they dont
7399065 the motivation behind these signs to make drivers more careful of their speed in areas with residential care homes is positive in practice a reduced speed limit in such areas as implemented in school districts would be a more welcome way to achieve this
7399066 i would go along with the fact that its a negative image that labels all elderly people as being stooped and infirm which of course is a long way from the truth maybe in some areas we need to have something which says be aware of pedestrians in general
7399067 its still a subliminal message among many others that just helps to make this an ageist society
7399068 do not discriminate against a certain group or show a certain group in a negative light
7399069 they should pay more attention to the real concerns of older people rising taxes and soaring household bills
7399070 the official purpose of the signs is to warn drivers that people with walking difficulties of any age could be crossing the road and may need extra time
7399071 as you can see nothings going the way im looking for
7399072 its outrageous government ministers are going round in public claiming to understand financial pressures people are under but behind closed doors they urge councils to squeeze even more money
7399073 we benchmark our charges against 65 other local authorities we review our tariffs every year and although prices can rise we always ensure that we remain good value for money
7399074 it is a great opportunity to build on the links we have in china and promote essex in the run up to 2012
7399075 essex has the potential to benefit hugely from the london games it is important we start laying the foundations now
7399076 one northeast has cost taxpayers over 1 4 billion but they have little to show for it
7399077 people are sick of paying through the nose for a massive costly quango that seems to do nothing but waste money on pointless activities the north east would be better off if this wasteful body was abolished and the money used to cut taxes on small businesses that would be the best way to create jobs and help the region
7399078 judged on their performance though rdas have been an expensive failure over 15 billion of taxpayers money has been spent over the past nine years with little discernable impact
7399079 annual increases in the number of jobs and the number of people in work have actually slowed since 1999
7399080 one northeast has consistently met or exceeded key government performance targets since it was established nearly ten years ago
7399081 the latest statistics show that the regional development agency helped create more than 17 000 new jobs in the region in the last financial year and assisted over 23 000 firms improve their performance
7399082 importantly at a time of great economic challenge there is strong support for one northeast across the business public and voluntary sectors for the economic goals set out in the regional economic strategy
7399083 we strive to achieve maximum value for every pound of taxpayers money we invest in the region to support and grow business and drive new opportunities
7399084 council houses reversing decades of government policy which has encouraged tenants to buy their council houses
7399085 if councils start giving out risky loans underwritten by taxpayers council tax could soar to totally unaffordable levels
7399086 could help up to 15 000 people out of difficulty and even provide a long term profit to the treasury the network claimed
7399087 daniel finds it a little bit hard to get close to people he doesnt like a lot of people around
7399088 i filled out the standard entry form for a tourist visa and on that form you have to write where youre headed and that was west virginia and they looked at that and it was suspicion straightaway almost and they made a call and i was just standing there and these two guys came up from homeland security
7399089 i thought it was a random check and i was kind of nervous about it but i thought ill calm down itll be over soon theyll ask me some questions and ill be on my way
7399090 they patted me down they had a bit of a feel downstairs and did all that kind of thing and that was that was disconcerting
7399091 they were looking more into the fact that i may just disappear into america and work there illegally
7399092 they were going from one idea or suspicion to another suspicion and were all over the place
7399093 at one point they were almost arguing with themselves about what are we going to pin him on
7399094 landing in detroit shouldnt be any different to landing in los angeles and new york
7399095 that said sometimes the inspections in those smaller less highly travelled destinations sometimes the inspections there are far more rigorous than they would be in the major ports of entry
7399096 this is a subjective process and inspectors in particular will tell you and feel quite proud to tell you that their gut instincts are very important and that their experience of many years of doing this work something that they rely on
7399097 hey people as you can see im back in my home in australia to you guys it probably seemed like ive never left because i havent posted anything since because ive been in prison
7399098 well i might as well have been in prison i was in a detention centre in detroit i was detained by border security on suspicion of terrorism and that makes me laugh
7399099 im banned from the us well there you go homeland security keeping america safe from australians
7399100 when i heard from him i was relieved that he got back i told him when i found out that i wasnt going to get to see you thats the point that i realised that i had to see you and if it means i have to fly to australia im gonna do it

7399108 the 16 day sport event has brought enormous joy and enthusiasm to the humanity and has won glory for both the host city beijing and the olympics
7399109 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7399110 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7399111 let us meet again in london in four years and hope for another great party that will bring glory to the olympics
7399112 our congratulations and thanks go to all the olympians who have made the beijing games so much better and left behind the sportsmanship and heroism that will inspire for many generations
7399113 the ultra modern venues and the transport facilities would not have been imaginable 30 years ago they are as much symbols of economic prowess as architectural masterpieces
7399114 the incredible logistics behind the smooth operation was the result of careful planning and meticulous coordination
7399115 obviously we can look forward to whats in front of us
7399116 being able to sweep baltimore definitely puts us in a much better situation against boston
7399117 i have a bunch of guys that just gave their hearts and souls to that game and i hope you understand that
7399118 i wish i would have had about 15 more minutes to sit out there with my team instead of come out here as quickly as i did thats how tough it is for me to process
7399119 i was trying to go down and away i didnt execute the pitch and big league hitters thats what theyre supposed to do
7399120 i dont think anybody in this locker room has the attitude to where were just going to come out magically in the regular season and everything is going to click
7399121 in a lot of ways we are behind because we have first team players out there just like the other team has first team players out there
7399122 the only thing we can do we can watch the film go to work and go out on the practice field to get better and then show it on game day i know none of us have the attitude that everything is just automatically going to click on in the regular season
7399123 is were going to come in yesterday morning and were going to get screamed at thats positive as a unit we need to step up and make plays like we did last year
7399124 we have a lot of talented players out there on our kickoff unit and our punt unit we need to watch the film to see what we need to correct and then go out and improve on it
7399125 regardless of whos in there its up to us to execute and do our job
7399126 you know it may come up where we have to be without tom so its up to whoevers in there to execute
7399127 its difficult now because the people who are in there just arent executing thats really the bottom line for us
7399128 hes a confident guy he plays hard and he was able to do some big things out there
7399129 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7399130 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7399131 that was last year if the refs are looking out for me thats what theyre going to do its not going to stop the way i play and prepare
7399132 id never alter my game just because of something like that that was in the past i really dont care about it im going to do what i got to do to get myself ready for the season
7399133 i think everything played itself out last year people ive met people ive talked with they know me as a person the thing i did worry about last year was my reputation
7399134 but i think at the end of the day i was fine with it i was fine with everything from a players standpoint the guys i play against understand the level of play that i play at its in the past
7399135 by the nature of his position being in the trenches i think you can get away with a lot of stuff down there because youre in close combat with the opposition so i dont think theres going to be any aftereffects from last year
7399136 officials are pretty good they dont let reputations get involved in the process or their decision making and i dont think its going to affect the way he plays hes lined up a few inches from the ball hes got combination blocks on him so he doesnt have time to think about it
7399137 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7399138 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7399139 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7399140 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7399141 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7399142 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7399143 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7399144 creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way
7399145 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
7399146 its a little unusual theyre all involved in the same gang
7399147 we confirmed it saturday and that was pretty much it
7399148 i didnt tell anybody because i wanted our team to be the first people i told
7399149 he had actually called aki collins and told aki that he was thinking about leaving friday at about 4 so friday at 4 weve got one hour of business day left before school starts monday morning at 8 a m
7399150 did a very good job academically progressed toward a degree had a great summer with our guys in the weight room so i was completely caught off guard
7399151 for all that you have to go through through an academic year through a basketball season through all the practices individual workouts weight sessions you want guys that are committed to being one of us
7399152 and if youre not committed then good luck wherever it is that you go
7399153 so i dont know that our guys are upset i think they kind of felt the same way i did if he feels lke thats what best for him we wish him nothing but the best
7399154 i dont know that mbakwe quitting puts more pressure on any of our guys
7399155 we all have to be held accountable every single day for what we do and the work that we produce and i feel comfortable that we will
7399156 how that plays out i dont know in regards to how many games well win or lose but im not a prophet and not smart enough to predict so i dont want to predict well if trevor would have been here he would have done this or he would have done that
7399157 who knows whos going to get hurt who knows whos going to get in foul trouble who knows who is on our team that were anticipating having a great year and doesnt whos on our team that is new that is going to surprise all of us i cant predict any of that well go with what weve got work at it every single day and see how it plays out
7399158 michael knows most of the offence having been in toronto with miller
7399159 its not like a guy coming to a new team and learning all the terminology he knows the system most probably it will be michael as the starter if he performs as expected and his confidence level is where it needs to be
7399160 if this was the grey cup he would be playing
7399161 we have nine games left after this one and the idea was made that it was better to wait and darian would have the benefit of another weeks rest
7399162 our coaches have a lot of faith in michael otherwise we wouldnt have made the trade
7399163 that said if michael starts this game hes not being anointed as the number one quarterback on the team thats a coaching decision as it should be and kenny will make that decision as we go forward but this week is a separate entity
7399164 we had a lengthy discussion about a myriad of scenarios
7399165 marcus will in fact be involved in the rest of the process as it unfolds i think thats fair and reflects the high regard we hold him in were trying to be as fair as we can under the circumstances
7399166 i think marcus deserves to be in the process and he will be beyond that well let the situation unfold as it does
7399167 beliau mungkin punya pertimbangan pertimbangan tertentu tetapi sangat disayangkan namun saya yakin mungkin beliau ada acara lain atau acara kenegaraan

7399184 there are 56 million unregistered voters nationwide 32 percent of the total eligible voter ranks the obama campaign says of that number eight million are black which is also 32 percent of eligible african american voters
7399185 so what are hillary delegates going to do when obama gets 2200 on the first vote
7399186 how many speeches are we going to hear havent we heard enough obama speeches
7399187 1 watergate 2 mcgovern as a result of watergate august 24th 2008 at 11 19 pm said please dont engage the trolls axelrod pays them an extra dollar each time they engage one of us obama almost always underperformed the pre election polls against hillary did he i seem to recall the pundits being repeatedly surprised that the undecideds were breaking for hillary http www miamiherald com living columnists dave barry story 655722 html august 24th 2008 at 11 20 pm said think about it they barge in here uninvited and throw down the gauntlet and to what purpose snide and demeaning remarks would get them escorted out of any number of parties or homes but in they march all swollen up with their righteous indignation hoping to achieve what pray tell astounding said stateofdisbelief on august 24th 2008 at 11 19 pm said edit comment nixon responsible for 1 watergate 2 mcgovern as a result of watergate 3 superdelegates as a result of mcgovern 4 obama as a result of superdelegates 5 mccain presidency as a result of obama said my 2 captions 1 just stay still while we put the kool aid implant in said if clinton were running we would have seen a landslide

7399194 dnc replaces delegate selection process with celebrity judges in a surprising turn of events howard dean announced this evening that in order to ensure that the selection process was viewed fair by all involved parties the usual delegate selection process has been cancelled in its place will be a process involving a celebrity panel of judges that will rate and critique the candidates speeches during the primetime viewing spot immediately following voting by text messaging will be allowed by those already logged into the system established by the obama campaigns pimp my veep text program celebrity judges selected to participate are vanilla ice anna nicole smiths baby and scarlett johanssen
7399195 we hope theres no trouble from obama supporters there was too much of that in the caucuses and primaries

7399197 they can see its not a huge problem some have even gone out on activities on tours or sand biking
7399198 is your sales team trained learn how to excel at retail sales this two part workshop
7399199 this is the highest thing any athlete can hope for it has been a very happy experience for me i am proud to bring the somali flag to fly with all of these countries and to stand with the best athletes in the world
7399200 there is no money for facilities or training the war the security the difficulties with food and everything there are just many other internal difficulties to deal with
7399201 when we went back home my friends and i were rounded up and we were told if we did it again we would get killed some of my friends stopped being in sports i had many phone calls threatening me that if i didnt stop running i would get killed lately i do not have these problems i think probably they realized we just wanted to be athletes and were not involved with the government
7399202 the food is not something that is measured and given to us every day
7399203 the stadiums i never thought something like this existed in the world
7399204 the buildings in the city it was all very surprising it will probably take days to finish all the stories we have to tell
7399205 i didnt know what it was when i saw it
7399206 the olympic fire in the stadium everywhere i am it is always up there
7399207 its like the moon i look up wherever i go it is there
7399208 the good thing sports is the one thing which unites all of somalia
7399209 because of us the somali flag is raised among all the other nations flags you cant imagine how proud we were when we were marching in the opening ceremonies with the flag
7399210 despite the difficulties and everything weve had with our country we feel great pride in our accomplishment
7399211 i was happy the people were cheering and encouraging me
7399212 but i would have liked to be cheered because i won not because i needed encouragement it is something i will work on i will try my best not to be the last person next time it was very nice for people to give me that encouragement but i would prefer the winning cheer
7399213 we know that we are different from the other athletes
7399214 but we dont want to show it we try our best to look like all the rest we understand we are not anywhere near the level of the other competitors here we understand that very very well but more than anything else we would like to show the dignity of ourselves and our country
7399215 if i were to enter the olympics it would be as
7399216 she has a voice like a songbird and loves singing
7399217 im just going to try and make new friends this week im not worried about making them all today
7399218 oh everyone is doing that maybe we should go get another child to grow up with this one
7399219 is your sales team trained learn how to excel at retail sales this two part workshop
7399220 our members believe the great emotional reaction of the public to the demotion of pluto shows the importance of pluto as a name
7399221 we may no longer believe in the roman god pluto but we still have a sense of personal connection with the former planet
7399222 an organism or species whose poor health or declining numbers hint at a larger environmental catastrophe on the horizon
7399223 so i hear you have a crush on her is it true
7399224 its easy to see that as disrespect and some hillary loyalists are going to resent it
7399225 the whole idea of a roll call vote could be in flux at this point
7399226 the clinton people here theyve said they wanted catharsis they wanted that roll call but they may not get it
7399227 they dont want to be blamed for any trouble at this convention
7399228 if you are ashamed of me i will be ashamed of you
7399229 multi site certainly doesnt produce growth its a tool to accommodate growth there is no coolness factor when you do it there is a coolness factor when people hear about it if your ministry is healthy and good that tool will speed up the growth of that ministry multi site only accelerates what you have
7399230 i hope this guy knows what he means to you and if he is smart he will never take you for granted
7399231 he stole my cell phone or he did this and she did that
7399232 the defendant doesnt call 911 rather he hands his son a shotgun not loaded and takes a pistol for himself
7399233 mr reeves believes in his heart that he was acting in self defense
7399234 we believe he made an irrational decision to go to a place where children were having what we thought was a back to school party
7399235 there is a foul stench in the air in chapin
7399236 i know what he did was to protect our family i would like very much to have him home
7399237 he is not a man of means they dont have an awful lot
7399238 i dont have any harsh feelings toward reeves i hate the action i hate how it ended
7399239 oh but they sell large ice cube trays like that at ikea
7399240 are u sure cause i was there like a few weeks ago and they didnt have them
7399241 did they stop selling them i couldnt find them at the north york location
7399242 that one doesnt have that much stuff try the etobicoke ikea or you could make them yourself like outta tinfoil
7399243 so i tried to line it with saran wrap in the tinfoil but the saran wrap always sticks to the cubes

7399287 children receive high doses of media violence it initially is packaged in ways that are not too threatening with cute cartoon like characters a total absence of blood and gore and other features that make the overall experience a pleasant one arousing positive emotional reactions that are incongruent with normal negative reactions to violence older children consume increasingly threatening and realistic violence but the increases are gradual and always in a way that is fun in short the modern entertainment media landscape could accurately be described as an effective systematic violence desensitization tool

7399297 laten we ze er daarna maar inhagelen sprak mijn assistent zei coach ed van orden die zijn team vervolgens binnen zes minuten naar de eindstand van 0 3 zag uitlopen
7399298 de mannen van ajax en apeldoorn zeiden nog zich om te kleden en dan weer te komen kijken
7399299 let me know if i hurt your feelings or if you feel slighted because that really isnt what i wanted to do
7399300 i believe that i can be a better sheriff by having a better understanding of jail operations from the perspective of an inmate
7399301 because the idea came to me in a church i believe it is divinely inspired
7399302 the biblical adage that we reap what we sow is very true in criminal justice
7399303 a light bulb kind of went off in my head
7399304 protest oil dependency and celebrate the power and individuality of our bodies
7399305 the approach is a new application of the well known botanical phenomenon of aerial root development instead of using plant branches this approach takes malleable roots and shapes them into useful objects for indoors and out

7399307 unemployment among computer related jobs hovers near historic lows as the u s information technology workforce tops 4 million for the first time
7399308 the number of workers employed by it services firms rose by 56 100 this past year to 1 414 400 a 4 1 percent increase according to last months bls establishment survey of some 160 000 businesses and government agencies covering about 400 000 worksites
7399309 why would it employment remain robust as unemployment rises in most other job categories it performs a critical role in business productivity and the efficiencies it brings are crucial for employers looking to trim costs including payrolls as fuel and related expenditures soar and the economy and dollar weakens in addition companies today cannot operate without functioning it systems so certain business technology skills cannot be eliminated if a company wants to remain competitive
7399310 the increase in it services employment reflects the continuing need by companies for outsourcers to manage corporate it infrastructures as well as provide hard to find but needed skills to develop and support new applications and systems
7399311 yes but how do i go about obtaining incoming or backlinks
7399312 im not saying hes wrong on everything i do agree that comics should be more kid friendly but to do that you dont need to run off all the older fans just to appeal to a younger audience being more accessible to kids could be as simple as less risque clothing on women and blocking out swearing not turning bullseye into an angry clown or making the paint balls at criminals
7399313 someone as passionate and knowledgeable about comics as he is should know better than to make such a blanket dismissal jeff parker and i have been associated and proudly with the marvel adventures line for many years and we work just as hard on them as any of our other works creator or corporate owned to make them the best comics they can be i would have to say anyone who says that the marvel adventures or first class books talk down to their readership of any age hasnt actually read many of them
7399314 i have no opinion on it as i havent really thought about it but what i did find interesting were the discussions on some of the various sites regarding that and of course they venture into a lot of other areas related to the matter im always surprised at how much mis information gets spewed out from people who really have no knowledge of what theyre promoting as reality im not going into specifics but just a warning that theres a lot of people who spout their wisdom as truth and they just dont have any clue to the real events
7399315 the only thing id really object to outright is his assertion that smaller companies dont have effective promotional arms
7399316 ive heard jeph loeb in interviews and he seems like a genuinely nice guy whos trying really hard to make good comics this doesnt make him a bad person it just makes him a person who created a bad comic and criticizing his book doesnt mean youre attacking him as a person if everyone from critics to artists to fans could remember this wed all be better off
7399317 but am i wrong in thinking that barons self proclaimed cocaine phase was also the time when he did his best work
7399318 i was standing right there while he was talking to people and watched his age fluctuate between 34 and 38 in one night
7399319 he thinks if he wasnt rich by the time he was 40 he is a failure
7399320 the most prevalent and forgivable reason men lie about their age is professional insecurity
7399321 you hit 40 so you fudge that youre 39 because you see all the new young turks under you with their fabulous careers
7399322 when i meet a guy whos a tech genius in san francisco and hear hes 30
7399323 this guy i know who is only 35 says he is 24 on his myspace profile
7399324 when i say im 25 in my profile i get 10 000 hits when i put it back to 34 i get like 212
7399325 its always interesting to see how age is listed on profiles on facebook
7399326 its always may 3 not may 3 1972 no one lists years unless they are in their early twenties
7399327 there is nothing like a group of married people especially with kids when you come into their circle with a younger thin woman
7399328 if hes over 40 you would hope that hes divorced
7399329 but if i date someone whos 40 its going to be chaos a lot of pressure if we want kids because we have to start that immediately and even then youre not guaranteed
7399330 he has the misconception that if youre married its a ball and chain
7399331 is the most socially skilled person ive ever met he has no problem picking up the best looking girl in the room
7399332 a lot of people want to get married and are not
7399333 theyre the bad influences and theyre the ones who are married going out with me is an excuse to get crazy again
7399334 some of them take off their wedding rings at bars just to talk to girls and flirt
7399335 ive spread myself so thin it makes me question how i can have a social life at all work on existing relationships let alone start a new one
7399336 eric has a very specific idea of what he likes
7399337 and looks like kate beckinsale in the last days of disco
7399338 i really want to talk to you are you gay
7399339 i was like no and shes probably apologized for it 10 times since
7399340 i used to work for a commercial bank that was very conservative
7399341 they expect the country club and taking customers and their wives out that would be very awkward because i certainly wouldnt be doing that
7399342 the only thing worse than a playboy who refuses to commit is a playboy who gets married
7399343 it was surprising coming here because ive been recognized more than ever
7399344 it was just like his pupils dilated or something he made me feel like a whore a little bit
7399345 there was someone i worked with recently who within five minutes displayed all the attributes of a fucking dick and i gave them the benefit of the doubt weeks later i was still there going youre so fucking self obsessed ive spent a long time giving people the benefit of the doubt and im tired of it
7399346 all of my friends got so drunk they couldnt even walk let alone dance and you just stand there going so what am i going to do
7399347 i saw a clip of something this girl has on a humongous fat suit and shes singing that my milk shake brings all the boys to the yard song and i just felt like thats so disrespectful
7399348 he understands emotional and psychological pain but i think his natural temperament is very light and very comic
7399349 if anybody wants to talk about their own family fine
7399350 its not that i think its just that i think its dangerous
7399351 theres a kid who secretly yearns to jump off buildings and say yippeekayay motherfucker i also thought that the fact that they were willing to cast someone like me showed a willingness to step outside the usual action movie realm
7399352 i want to be like matt damon and do a hugely successful action franchise like bourne
7399353 i like romantic comedies ive been in one and i fucking loved it i got to show off and i got to be a dick its always fun to play dicks thats why i loved
7399354 someone like james i would guess would strive to play the opposite of what hes been made to believe he is as a unit of currency
7399355 ive watched james being pursued by people who want to pin him down and whether he knows it or not hes just slid like a bar of soap right out of their hands
7399356 i remember that feeling of that soft spot just north east of your mouth against my lips
7399357 hey im not afraid to get my l l bean boots muddy remember when it rained during the hootie amp the blowfish concert at the miller lite riverplex those were some
7399358 yo we just renovated and it is fuckin nice wall to wall carpeting marble bathrooms the whole deal i even renovated nancy hey nancy show joey here your triple ds
7399359 is it cool if we just get a couple of coffees and sit outside
7399360 i never chose to do this because there was meaning in it or i was talented or gave a shit about acting
7399361 its necessary you have to become edible for people in texas you have to become edible for the christian right for mass audiences
7399362 i dont ever remember getting arrested sober i was always arrested drunk
7399363 its when im drinking that i dont have the wherewithal to be able to realize the position of my life theres too much at stake for me to throw it away i enjoy what im able to give my family i enjoy the people that im able to wake up and work with and i dont want to throw away what ive worked so hard for 12 years to achieve based on an argument that takes place in 20 minutes
7399364 none of my friends were ever as broke as i was
7399365 thats not some dramatic spinning of a tale my uncle was going to adopt me at one point because my parents couldnt afford to have me anymore they had too much pride to go on welfare or food stamps
7399366 it was never drugs it was never like that for my family which helped me because i never had a curiosity it was never closed off it was always out in the open and it was always explained to me im so grateful for that its why i never tried anything beyond marijuana or drinking i mean i know that i personally cant do any of it and so i dont
7399367 theres this weird dichotomy of having to appear human yet be a mysterious entity in order to continue doing your craft i need something to talk about and then you dont have to get into deep personal introspection
7399368 it taught me that the performance doesnt end until you go home
7399369 once theyre at your house and you know theyre following you you have the choice should i run or should i take them to the car wash and create the image of the normal guy
7399370 shias ability to connect with everyone is rooted in honesty its not that hes the everyman its that he believes hes in that situation and so the audience believes hes in that situation
7399371 its only recently that i became a part of their lexicon
7399372 shia ladouche or labeef and all this shit and i understand where theyre coming from if i was a fan freak sitting at my house and i worked at auto zone and some twentysomething young buck had a meteoric rise and was in every movie i ever wanted to watch id hate him immediately
7399373 if you wanted to be friends with the people i was hanging out with
7399374 one completely in the wrong one who wasnt enjoying his job that night going at it about minuscule bullshit
7399375 and its just a bad deal its not something that is conducive to being a role model no iconic actors that i know of have problems like that and i dont know how to do it like a gentleman i dont know how to have one drink
7399376 i mean look you get arrested its out of control theres nothing in control about the situation
7399377 its not as though things happen to me and i dont say never again
7399378 i can never say never because of where im at in my life and the vices that ive let go of
7399379 but even when i was drinking i never missed call times ever
7399380 im going to pakistan for for a while for work
7399381 youre not supposed to tell people what you do right up to the point when you pop the question at which point they wonder what else youve been lying about
7399382 there is an ongoing pissing match between the cia stations in kabul and islamabad
7399383 kabul says the pakistanis are dirty from head to toe islamabad says the pakistanis are only partially dirty and we get something out of working with them
7399384 like most people they didnt know what a case officer actually does
7399385 it was a thing of do you stay or do you go
7399386 you never really get it until youve been there and youve seen the area and you get a feel for it
7399387 and youre like oh yeah this is obviously the most hostile operational environment outside russia under stalin
7399388 the increased level of staffing sounds good but it makes sure veteran officers spend most of their time teaching and not chasing
7399389 we had reinforcements come from all over the agency volunteers who were eager to help smart guys and women but they dont know how to do a name trace they might be able to trace joe smith trying to get into a compound but ahmed zubaida is another kettle of fish for them especially when it can be spelled three ways
7399390 they brought in officers with experience in either latin america or africa where cofer black the director of the counterterrorist center at the time had worked
7399391 they made it so secluded you had to have a green sticky dot on the back of your badge in order to get into their offices only the most senior officials got a green sticker
7399392 by april may 2002 we began losing people to the groups that were preparing for the iraq war
7399393 the relationship can vary from one of animosity and turf protection to cooperation and supporting efforts
7399394 it used to be not uncommon to have an agency chief of base spend eight weeks in the place and rotate home
7399395 picture a cia chief of base who has a college degree in astrophysics showing up to some far off safe house in the middle of nowhere where a few black ops military guys who dont impress easily await the agency guy can either swallow some humble pie or he can act like he owns the place and try to make all decisions black ops guys typically have no use for officers or commanders and an agency college boy is no different
7399396 one of the biggest issues among the joint teams is the speed at which decisions are made and information passed
7399397 the guy on the ground can be standing on a mountain see some activity make an assessment and dial up the boss back at bagram using his sat phone
7399398 by this time the chief of station is in an uproar because the military channels have already passed the news up and over to the agency and the chief has yet to hear about it it makes for some very ruffled feathers
7399399 in a way it was a luxury being that far away because it allowed me not to think about it so much
7399400 youre focused on a job and its kind of a blessing
7399401 we were working with the pakistanis and they had an inside guy who was able to watch a compound where they believed this guy was staying
7399402 they were not jerking us around as they do in other bases
7399403 so we were watching this place and did he show up
7399404 not while i was there i later learned he showed up after i left they took a shot and missed him they got some of his bodyguards
7399405 a couple of people said they almost thought me going to pakistan kept him alive longer
7399406 he wanted to make sure that i made it back
7399407 never again will a disaster of this nature be handled in the terrible and disgraceful way in which it was handled
7399408 governor jindal is one of the great governors of the united states
7399409 im honored to have his friendship and i will rely on governor jindal for many many things in the future when i am president
7399410 we like our politicians like many of our cultural dishes
7399411 being the son of an immigrant is almost like being a convert to americanism
7399412 as a kid i would roll my eyes at my dad when hed say be grateful you are an american
7399413 when my father would say you have great potential it wasnt a compliment
7399414 what you see now is what you saw then focused feet on the ground always knew where he was going
7399415 i was raised in a strong hindu culture attended weekly pujas or ceremonial rites and read the vedic scriptures
7399416 in the same way that many westerners think hindus worship cows
7399417 while she could not reply to any one of my arguments for abortion
7399418 i could not help but be amazed by her genuine compassion and innocence kathys sincere convictions showed me an aspect of christianity i had never encountered before
7399419 i was probably the first teenager who ever told his parents he was going to a party so that he could sneak off to church
7399420 my parents were infuriated by my conversion they blamed themselves for being bad parents blamed me for being a bad son and blamed evangelists for spreading dissension
7399421 i think its something they now respect they support and they encourage
7399422 they were at the baptisms of my children and they were at my wedding
7399423 i think it was very much an intellectual journey for him
7399424 i think their initial skepticism was rooted in the belief that maybe this was teenage rebellion was this just an act of a child rejecting something because his parents identified with it or was it deeper
7399425 was the 16 year old bobby jindal already so determined that he wanted to appeal to his classmates
7399426 no one really knows much about that transformation hed make for a fascinating psychological treatise
7399427 it appeared as if we were observing a tremendous battle between the susan we knew and loved and some strange evil force
7399428 the physicians improbable explanation that the biopsy may have removed all the cancerous tissue is no less far fetched
7399429 with holy water and blessed crucifixes i have even given her physical protection from the demons that have only once reappeared and then for a mere moment
7399430 i dont think they thought long or hard about it
7399431 peoples tastes in music food and clothing get fixed at some age
7399432 i came of age during the 1980s and the political figure that dominated the eighties was ronald reagan he was very popular so it was easy to identify with a lot of the things he stood for
7399433 bobby was like 23 years old so i asked if hed consider a deputy position
7399434 when they told me he was 24 i wasnt very interested
7399435 i want to be the most boring but most effective governor
7399436 he was ivy league educated and hed spent almost his entire career in government
7399437 and he looked different from just about everyone in the state
7399438 not one mention of maybe the music his parents listened to or the food that he ate growing up nothing
7399439 my grandparents theyre real old school and they didnt vote for jindal the first time around because of his ethnicity
7399440 i cant help it man thats the way i am
7399441 if hes got an achilles heel he hasnt revealed it yet
7399442 its that he hasnt stayed in a job long enough
7399443 he would take that job the people of louisiana would be extremely disappointed
7399444 there hasnt been a losing vp candidate whos come back to win the presidency since 1920
7399445 my biggest fear is well run out of time before we get everything done
7399446 these are generational decisions were making this state has the opportunity to make massive changes
7399447 i disagree with many of his positions but i still get goose bumps listening to him speak hes bringing a very positive message to the race
7399448 yeah but you wont say that to the tv cameras
7399449 he said ill do it you just cant fake that kind of earnestness
7399450 childhood is a crucial time when bodies are growing and brains are developing its so important to fuel the body with good nutrition and teaching children smart at a young age is a great idea it starts with the parents serving as the role model
7399451 when children consume a high fat high sugar meal their bodies will crash and they will become very tired and lethargic which is not going to help them perform at their best level in school
7399452 owh i do not like that sleeve on this dress take it off
7399453 we have too often retreated behind our differences when no one really tried to lead us beyond them
7399454 the office was underway biden an irish catholic grew up in blue collar scranton where he watched his father scramble to make ends meet after some poor investment decisions
7399455 getting stuck on their backs and dying of suffocation attacked by flies eaten by maggots being attacked by dogs or any other living creature being frightened into a heart attack by imagining the dog is going to attack even though it is not drowning are we surprised sheep cannot swim suffocating in snow surprisingly common hoof infections that poison the blood almost exploding with grass because they have eaten too much and are unable to pass wind if they get too hot if they get too cold it is an interesting fact that sheep farmers spend their days trying to keep sheep from dying only to eventually kill them anyway though usually in an abbatoir as opposed to from injuries incurred while stuck in a hedge
7399456 when i came to singapore in 1991 there were no more than 20 000 indian expatriates now i think there are about 200 000 professional indians working here
7399457 more indian students want to study different subjects and this is a sign that students are becoming more cosmopolitan
7399458 we never wait for a waiting list to build up we are always working ahead to meet the education needs of expatriates
7399459 i think schools have to look at larger campuses so that they dont have to expand every two years
7399460 and i think we have to proactively build the campus ahead by anticipating demands
7399461 well be looking at the middle east and particularly the united arab emirates region were also looking at indonesia and australia
7399462 bishan active provides a convenient place for our youth to engage in sporting activities and discover their talents
7399463 who knows among them we may find our next olympian in the making
7399464 we are the first estate to get a beach volleyball court its a great place for young people to hang out and interact
7399465 in new york its about serious fashion in l a its about play
7399466 theres an overstudied attempt at informality in the way men in l a approach dressing
7399467 its a desperate attempt to look like theyre not trying too hard when in effect they just look like theyre trying too hard
7399468 when i lived in l a i dressed like this
7399469 and if i got one more question about what i was so dressed up for
7399470 he raises an interesting point perversely enough the guy on the hot seat for his clothing choices here isnt the one with intricately shaved facial hair and a t shirt with a heart and skull emblazoned on the the one in the custom suit and classic loafers
7399471 globo por 1 a 0 con gol de diego alonso a los 41 minutos del segundo tiempo con este resultado el equipo local obtuvo su primer triunfo en el torneo apertura
7399472 ha evolucionado muy bien y se muere de ganas por estar
7399473 hay que tomar recaudos porque un arquero tiene mayor exposici n a un golpe que un jugador de campo
7399474 al met een eendaagse cursus sociale vaardigheden waarbij het baasje de meest elementaire zaken wordt geleerd kunnen heel wat problemen worden voorkomen
7399475 maar zoals zo vaak is de financiering een probleem in onze opzet wordt de cursus betaald door de gemeenten die daarvoor putten uit het potje hondenbelasting in ruil krijgen gemeenten toegang tot de landelijke database zodoende zijn ze exact op de hoogte van het bestaan van iedere hond dat levert weer extra hondenbelasting op
7399476 het socialiseren van de pups is n maar het opvoeden van de eigenaar is ook hard nodig
7399477 misschien moeten we sommige honden maar muilkorven in de publieke ruimte ik wil me best sterk maken voor die sociale veiligheid
7399478 hoe meer mensen het weten hoe beter een aankoop moet nooit een impulsaankoop zijn maar verplichten nee
7399479 bijvoorbeeld voor minder mobiele ouderen op het platteland terwijl zij heel goed met een hondje kunnen omgaan
7399480 uitstekend als de verkoper van een hond een cursus aanraadt maar een verplichting gaat te ver
7399481 check my mom and dads room cause he was watchin tv in there earlier
7399482 yeah i saw it too and didnt want to be the only one
7399483 things are really good at work at the moment and i am due for a big bonus at the end of the year
7399484 not resulted in significant constructive behavioral change among our students
7399485 a culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus
7399486 we had a celebration in the neighborhood and you could see the scenes of festivity everywhere
7399487 people thought that i was injured because i was covered with blood but it wasnt from my injuries it was of others only god saved me
7399488 now that we know that lawyers are going to be prosecuted for it like terry christensen we know that we have to keep that in mind and be more careful than in the past
7399489 they would normally call you and say i need a b and c
7399490 theyll say i want this all done legally and i want no wink winks
7399491 maybe it makes them a little more conscious in their instructions to investigators to make sure they observe the law
7399492 the adversary system is based on notions of fair play and i think what makes this of such great concern is the spying if it did happen in this way is so inconsistent with that basic rule
7399493 everybody scurries and becomes much more careful then eventually with time people forget
7399494 obviously i dont want to go to jail and i want to keep my lawyers and clients out of jail thats always in the back of my mind
7399495 youd have to severely cut into education which i dont think is the right thing you would severely cut into healthcare which is not the right thing to do you would severely have to cut into prisons and we cant do that
7399496 fix the budget system once and for all so this will never ever happen again
7399497 do a compromise where you make the democrats do something they never would have done and make we republicans do something we normally would never do
7399498 i just think the wisest thing to do is to go to the people and say look i know ive said no taxes
7399499 we dont want to exchange multi year spending cuts for a one year budget
7399500 we republicans have all been united in our belief that the state has a spending and not a revenue problem
7399501 it is so discouraging to see the governor walk away from these core principles
7399502 i want to be a public servant not a party servant i mean im a supporter of my party and im a republican but were supposed to serve the people not the party
7399503 i hate tax increases but im willing to go beyond my beliefs and ideology to make a compromise its the only way we can solve this budget problem
7399504 common sense approach for those who believe in active management
7399505 in investing just as in baseball to put runs on the scoreboard one must watch the playing field not the scoreboard
7399506 be the first to know whom barack picks as his running mate
7399507 look heidi there are a bunch of guys on the pile in silver suits
7399508 dying is very scary especially if you have little faith in god
7399509 life is very fragile and death very very scary even if you have tons of faith in god and even though it wont make it less scary dont put off change
7399510 even though it wont make it less scary dont put off change
7399511 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
7399512 i have come so that they may have life and have it the full
7399513 y bueno viste son cosas que pasan todo va a cambiar la vida siempre da vueltas
7399514 great world city is on the fringe of orchard road which means shoppers do not have to pay erp charges in the evenings it is an ideal alternative to orchard road
7399515 we want to focus on our position of being a neighbourhood mall to the high end residential districts of 9 10 and 11
7399516 great world city is in a neither here nor there situation because its not in a suburban area with heartlander masses but its also not along orchard road if a brand like marks amp spencer can take off at great world city it will be a great opportunity for the mall to prove it can attract crowds too
7399517 we told trent sama that we would love to carry a child for him but he refused
7399518 he said that he didnt want to have the pain his brother had when he lost the woman and child he loved so we are slightly happy but mostly sad
7399519 okay so why are you two here when you could be by trent kun
7399520 we wanted to ask you a question why are men so strange
7399521 i dont know the answer to that question i sort of wish i knew the answer myself
7399522 we are strange because its the animal instinct that is in humans only
7399523 what animal instinct are you talking about humans arent animals
7399524 thats the problem with some people humans are animals in the grand view of the world we hunt for food we search for water we breath air we build or seek shelter and we have offspring those are the basics for an animal
7399525 trent sama isnt an animal take it back old man
7399526 i understand what cedric san is talking about i have seen bens instinct at work when this room flipped over ben grabbed me and kept me from being squished under the bed
7399527 the bear blade style is just a key to understanding the world and its balance humans are animals with their own set of instincts that are unique and rare among animals we will gladly use ourselves as a shield to protect those we care for ben probably knew you had hellia on your back but didnt care about himself but about you
7399528 i thought something was odd about that smile i knew he was forcing that smile it wasnt the kind of smile he use to have for maria
7399529 lets leave so we dont wake up ben or master ang
7399530 nothing can wake ben up right now if he used the dark bear spell as for fang whacks master ang with justin wake up you old coot i have over ten rooms in this house go into one of them and sleep there
7399531 a host invites his guests in i never invited you into my house you are an uninvited guest so i see no problem hitting you with a cane
7399532 if you are going to argue do it somewhere else please
7399533 why did you two drag me you could have just asked me to come with you
7399534 we want to know why you wont let us carry a child of yours inside us what is your true reason
7399535 i just dont think its right for me to have a child before brother i am younger so i should do things second
7399536 but recently you have been doing things before sir ben you had a living weapon first you cast spells before sir ben you even learned a jutsu that he doesnt even know so i see no reason why that should be an excuse
7399537 thats right i am different from my brother i dont have to be in his shadow i can live a life i desire
7399538 what is that white stuff i never seen it before
7399539 its called snow its cold and fluffy they look up at trent want to go play in the snow trent sama
7399540 i didnt think anything could be this cold its almost as cold as that spell artemis and master law hit brother and i with
7399541 if you want we can go back inside and get ready for snow travel we know where we are were back on lyran and we are close to our city
7399542 master trent this is your chance to choose your own path you can always reunite with your brother later we can always kill magos later you are not as hellbent on destroying the magos like sir ben
7399543 well lets go back and get ready for traveling then
7399544 nee san i thought you had shorter hair what happened
7399545 i keep my hair on my head so no one would notice my long hair i thought since i had a chance to take a bath i would wash my hair as well
7399546 its been a rough day i got up this morning put on a shirt and a button fell off i picked up my briefcase and the handle came off im afraid to go to the bathroom
7399547 a clear conscience is usually the sign of a bad memory
7399548 marriage is when a man and woman become as one the trouble starts when they try to decide which one
7399549 you have a cough go home tonight eat a whole box of ex lax tomorrow youll be afraid to cough
7399550 when i die i want to go peacefully like my grandfather did in his sleep not screaming like the passengers in his car
7399551 why does sea world have a seafood restaurant im halfway through my fish burger and i realize oh man i could be eating a slow learner
7399552 foolproof systems dont take into account the ingenuity of fools
7399553 you promised me lord that if i followed you you would walk with me always but i have noticed that during the most trying periods of my life there has only been one set of footprints in the sand why when i needed you most have you not been there for me
7399554 we can use these dears to send a message to our city and to our comrades here on lyran they can then communicate to our forces on the other three continents for more attacks
7399555 im afraid we dont so even if we synchronize an attack with the forces on harpina the other two will be on full alert before we could get there
7399556 i thought of a few scenarios one is to use the information from the kunoichis city to locate the other two headquarters and then attack all four at the same time but then there is the possibility that there is a fifth one which is the main base that is either on one of the continents or even flying in the sky wait master ang the two bases we know where were they again
7399557 one is in the mountain range just east of this valley and the other one is on the coast of the ocean between lyran and harpina oh i see the boss of the magos must be this aire muerte i heard about and the other two must be near the other two elements
7399558 so there are volcanoes on this continent and but what about this one master
7399559 thats flautan its has mount mag there that is known for its strong magnetic quality in fact almost all of the compasses in the world use mount mag for a magnetic point the other continent is siren a volcanic region which is almost inhabitable except for a few areas due to the intense heat from the magma there
7399560 the five elements earth is here in lyran water is there in harpina electric is up here in flautan and fire is here in siren but where is the wind
7399561 where ever the wind blows it that one is a mobile base
7399562 each base has an element for its defense and its offense could there be a base that is shrouded in darkness
7399563 i doubt that there is an magos alive who would tamper with dark spells as for the dark spell you learned from that scroll its only dark in name only its just a spell that allows a bear blade user the ability to absorb mana and restore ki at an extremely fast pace but like darkness spells there is a price to pay thud after a period of six hours you will collapse and sleep for three days straight not even you can escape that but at least it will get you much needed sleep you little fool
7399564 do you think he actually learned and used that spell claw
7399565 there is one way to know observe him in his sleep if he sleeps for three days to the minute then yeah he learned and used the spell
7399566 mister claw can we go somewhere else this place is too scary
7399567 i think i will scout this area when you all are ready for an offensive against the magos meet me in lyrans port city of hargo
7399568 you two have become friendlier and you were watching him train
7399569 actually she was opposed to ben learning the bear blade she didnt mind if he learned his fathers martial arts but she didnt want him to learn the bear blade especially after the first training session so she never watched him during anything that dealt with fighting
7399570 i would have thought that ben would have mentioned it in the village she was called the prettiest flower but that was just for the village in fact when she was younger or so i heard from hiroto bens own mother was called the prettiest flower in the village before she married hiroto
7399571 well i just got done going through reapers mind and apparently he showed bens past to ashley and hellia something only a bear blade could do
7399572 he did show us the past but she was pregnant with his child how could i even think of replacing his memories
7399573 replacing memories who said anything about replacing anything what is happening between you two is not a replacement for those he lost but the making of new memories with those who are here and now
7399574 that is an interesting accessory to your weapon a shard from the wind emerald
7399575 you know what it is what is this wind emerald
7399576 its a source of power there is one for each element wind emerald fire ruby aqua sapphire terra topaz and electric amethyst in fact the color of a persons aura is a key to finding ones key elements bens aura is normally green corresponds with the emerald which is why he can move so fast also his aura becomes purple when he absorbs mana into his body which corresponds to the amethyst
7399577 so ben could use wind and electric magic with ease
7399578 no only electric magic his ki attacks are supported by the wind in fact i trained him in running he can run 20 miles in an instant
7399579 trent also has the same green aura for his normal ki thats why he can keep up with his brother but his orange aura is based on the topaz so earth spells will be his specialty
7399580 and even though you dont notice it your own aura is blue ashley if you were to train with a master you could learn water spells but i dont know what your mana soaked aura looks like so i can only guess that it will become a darker blue
7399581 i think i will go to sleep here i could use the sleep i didnt get much these past months roco get to your scabbard
7399582 hellia dont be mad at him or ben or their weapons they are just different from the men we know i think i will tell ben later
7399583 were pleased to be here in the heart of new orleans to announce the frog princess a great story with all the ingredients that go into making an extraordinary motion picture experience like many of disneys most popular fairy tales it has elements of magic fantasy adventure heart humor and music the films new orleans setting and strong princess character give the film lots of excitement and texture were also thrilled to have john musker ron clements and randy newman lending their talents and creative energies to this project john and ron helped to usher in disneys second golden age of animation nearly two decades ago with the little mermaid and are on track to create the studios next great fairy tale adventure
7399584 aside from being longtime friends and colleagues john and ron are two of the most influential and imaginative filmmakers in the animation medium and i am so excited to be working with them in bringing their creative vision for the frog princess to the big screen theyve come up with an original story that is deeply rooted in the fairy tale tradition and its filled with great humor emotion and musical moments randy newman brings fun and excitement to every project and i couldnt think of a better choice to deliver some wonderful new orleans style music
7399585 princess tiana will be a heroine in the great tradition of disneys rich animated fairy tale legacy and all other characters and aspects of the story will be treated with the greatest respect and sensitivity

7399589 our specialists and rescue teams are working at the site of the crash and of course we are doing everything possible to save lives
7399590 shortly after takeoff the crew got in touch with the airport and requested to land back at the airport due to an emergency situation on board
7399591 apparently they realized they could not get back to the airport and tried to crash land
7399592 if you look at the history of communications equipment while many people have pursued multi function all in one god boxes none were ever bought or delivered
7399593 the complexity of the ims architecture is the main obstacle to real deployment together with standards ambiguity even though the industry has come a long way in the last 2 to 3 years on one hand we see consolidation with the operational convergence between 3gpp 3gpp2 and etsi tispan but on the other hand standards are not always clear for example if we look at the status with vcc for fixed mobile convergence it is clear that we dont really have a standardised blueprint on how to build an fmc network
7399594 interoperability is still a challenge it has come along way but it still has a ways to go as a result of my conversations with network operators who are actually deploying ims most of them are choosing to go with a single vendor as opposed to many its not the best time for achieving interoperability but its good for ims in that operators are actually deploying it interoperability is one of the bigger challenges faced by ims adoption the way the ims ngn plugfests are set up they are usually done in stages the first stage is just establishing a basic call or doing a basic registration between different vendors which is what practically the whole first plugfest was about at the most recent plugfest vendors achieved the first step very quickly its a sign of real progress for interoperability how quickly can vendors equipment actually work together practically right out of the box
7399595 are operators now so comfortable with multivendor operability that theyre willing to make deployments in their live networks
7399596 i dont think thats true on a large scale yet certainly some of the larger operators have pretty sophisticated interoperability labs where theyre demonstrating multivendor interoperability internally but they havent deployed to the networks yet though of course they have plans to do so another trend is that many vendors are aware of the interoperability issues and have partnered with some of the best of breed component vendors out there to make sure they can interoperate with at least specific vendors or devices
7399597 while it might be theoretically possible to mix and match all of these various ims functions from different vendors that doesnt necessarily imply that such a practice is economically viable if you buy a lot of equipment from one vendor theyre going to give you a better price than if you just buy one component from one vendor and one from another vendor the reality is that interoperability is probably going to be done in layers certainly there are many different kinds of application servers out there along with many different services one main goal appears to be to achieve pretty broad interoperability with the service layer similarly theres a lot of different kinds of network edge access equipment so you need to have pretty board interoperability with that equipment interestingly in the network core it doesnt seem to be as important for most operators to have a variety of different vendors represented there in their infrastructure a typical operator is quite happy dealing with one vendor who controls the core network as long as theyre compliant with the ims specification
7399598 also there are vendors out there such as bea that are working on service delivery platforms or the app server layer and companies like broadsoft that has made excellent traction in this space with their ip centrex type business voip tech services
7399599 but those are application server vendors who plug pretty neatly into the ims architecture at least in its simplest form today
7399600 the ims architecture allows applications to store user profile information and application specific information on the hss home subscriber server user database in the ims architecture but it doesnt appear that very many vendors are supporting that capability today and the specifications for actually putting and sharing that user data in a common location is not a mature practice yet more standardization work needs to be done
7399601 the msf is backed by the major service providers the most recent one was in 2006 by bt france telecom ntt and verizon here in the u s at the gmi they test multivendor operability such as anortel alert device talking to one from ericsson but they also test network to network interoperability there will ultimately be multiple ims networks out there and the networks themselves will talk to each other as opposed to just the vendors devices within those networks thats another layer of complexity since every ims based operator is faced with hundreds of configuration options if some of those configurations are a bit off they can cause interoperability issues between the networks when you try to pass a call from one network to another
7399602 our test and monitoring equipment at empirix continues to be refined and we help quite a bit with the challenges of ims interoperability testing such as complexity
7399603 we help simplify test scenarios and help make the automated tests easier and able to handle more tests there are so many tests you can run today simply because there are so many more things to test than previously in other areas you could be dealing with a standards ambiguity of ims since there are always changes to specifications fortunately it looks like the release 7 specifications are pretty locked down most operators however are still implementing release 6 but all vendors are working with release 8 specs which are largely still to be defined or are otherwise in progress adapting to all of these changes is important along with being able to adapt quickly which is another key capability that weve built into our products

7399607 my father taught me that the question who made me
7399608 why did god issue just those natural laws and no others
7399609 after all i only know this world i do not know about the rest of the universe but so far as one can argue at all on probabilities one would say that probably this world is a fair sample and if there is injustice here the odds are that there is injustice elsewhere also
7399610 the underneath ones must be good so as to redress the balance
7399611 here we find in this world a great deal of injustice and so far as that goes that is a reason for supposing that justice does not rule in the world and therefore so far as it goes it affords a moral argument against deity and not in favor of one
7399612 resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also
7399613 give to him that asketh of thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away
7399614 if thou wilt be perfect go and sell that which thou hast and give to the poor
7399615 ye shall not have gone over the cities of israel till the son of man be come
7399616 there are some standing here which shall not taste death till the son of man comes into his kingdom
7399617 ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell
7399618 whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world nor in the world to come
7399619 the son of man shall send forth his his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
7399620 if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched
7399621 he was hungry and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came if haply he might find anything thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet
7399622 i am going to expose all this humbug and tell the people of erewhon that it was only i the man higgs and i went up in a balloon
7399623 you must not do that because all the morals of this country are bound round this myth and if they once know that you did not ascend into heaven they will all become wicked
7399624 this is an indissoluble sacrament you must endure celibacy or stay together and if you stay together you must not use birth control to prevent the birth of syphilitic children
7399625 what has human happiness to do with morals the object of morals is not to make people happy
7399626 it is an amazing material it has the lowest density of any product known to man yet at the same time it can do so much i can see aerogel being used for everything from filtering polluted water to insulating against extreme temperatures and even for jewellery
7399627 the heating has improved significantly i turned the thermostat down five degrees its been a remarkable transformation
7399628 the only problem i had was that my feet were too hot which is a great problem to have as a mountaineer

7399640 tom went to argentina how the hell can he afford to go to argentina he cannot be making that much money he should barely afford to ride the subway he must have gone into deep debt for this asshole
7399641 she was such a stupid slut back in undergrad not sure she even graduated probably quit when she was done blowing all male teaching assistants for grades how could she have married a doctor asshole im sure
7399642 how do these two even know each other is there a support group for people with bad b o who are also close talkers because thats the only place they could have met assholes both
7399643 damn he looks good i should have fucked him when i had the chance im such an asshole

7399645 try taking its battery out and then putting it back in again
7399646 how about you take a break from licking my balls

7399651 no way my friend lived here as long as i can remember
7399652 well your right the house i lived was easy walking distance from the siam palace
7399653 why why all these constant frustrations on top of all the trials ive been dealing with lately
7399654 moab has been at ease from his youth he has settled on his dregs and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel nor has he gone into captivity therefore his taste remained in him and his scent has not changed
7399655 youre too comfortable i dont want you to spoil so im going to pour you out from vessel to vessel in order that you depend on me more and your taste is sweet not bitter to me and to others
7399656 i wished to trade places with him for her too have him back and take me instead
7399657 i will work when you work but ur not gonna do anything until i do
7399658 they wont know the difference theres money there just say you started your checks at a smaller number say no
7399659 f it there are two ways to skin that chicken
7399660 this is going to end up being a cockmanship tournament between he and i
7399661 in a week hell be here to lick my balls
7399662 the card collectors con men and the true story of historys most desired baseball card
7399663 sex is like a great river that is rich and deep and good as long as it stays within its proper channel however if it overflows its banks it becomes destructive
7399664 for this is the will of god your sanctification that you should abstain from sexual immorality that each of you should know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor not in passion of lust like the gentiles who do not know god
7399665 for i know the thoughts that i think toward you says the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you a future and a hope
7399666 there isnt that divide where theres a couple of huge movies coming every week
7399667 one film like the dark knight can make a huge difference
7399668 it was eerie but on the other hand when looking at it from stauffenbergs viewpoint and what he did and what these men did it was powerful
7399669 as an actor i think i can say for all of us who were there that we felt fortunate to get those locations and shoot at those places it really changes the performances to do it there at that spot
7399670 these guys are true american patriots they were fighting two wars
7399671 they were fighting the nazis the fascists in pacific and they were fighting jim crow racism prejudice in the united states of america at the same time
7399672 i love the idea of it it applied to where bond was at the end of the last movie
7399673 the one thing he didnt have with the relationship was that quantum of solace
7399674 its rare where you get a piece of material thats politically pertinent like this but also sort of non preachy and engaging entertainment for an audience
7399675 he doesnt want to be a monster he doesnt want to kill people
7399676 he loves her but if he gets too passionate he will want her blood he will want to kill her
7399677 doing those type of scenes is always a bit strange never mind a husband but an entire crew watching you
7399678 this was two lone wolves its a duel two complicated fascinating really brilliant people
7399679 for men with their histories their intelligence their egos a contest like this really did become kind of life and death
7399680 they say it in the piece there can be only one winner
7399681 were telling it while hes still in office which has never been done
7399682 the set decoration is insane and beautiful to think in the first movie we only had a ladder
7399683 everythings bigger from details like the wardrobe because of how big the screen is and the musical numbers are so much bigger
7399684 he believes hes only got a short time to live and that hes come down with this disease so hes kind of convinced hes got to get up the nerve to tell her how he feels before he dies
7399685 likely to be the most widely watched games in olympic history
7399686 we had more broadcast coverage to more people in more places than ever
7399687 if they are not theists why would they get offended by being called catholic child molesters
7399688 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7399689 after two days of negative publicity over its extrajudicial detention of 10 tibet supporters the chinese government is seeking to suppress a story that would have cast a shadow over the closing ceremony of these olympic games which includes a final propaganda push to legitimize chinas rule in tibet with tibetans singing and dancing along with other so called ethnic minorities
7399690 provide a wide variety of information products to the entire dod family
7399691 throughout the department of defense and to the american public high quality visual information products including combat camera imagery depicting u s military activities and operations
7399692 policies priorities and programs properly reflect dod wide and military service unique messages and strategic communications requirements
7399693 they took my music books and my daughters coloring books
7399694 we believe that mr tenenbaum was subjected to unusual and unwelcome scrutiny because of his faith and ethnic background a practice that would undoubtedly fit a definition of discrimination whether actionable or not
7399695 we will certainly review the issues raised in the dod inspector generals review for any procedures and policies that may need to be addressed or other steps that we should take to address the situation
7399696 the party state was clearly a winner in the eyes of the people
7399697 it is a total breakthrough we did a perfect job on security and provided good services to all the athletes
7399698 gepensioneerde kat die werd erg onrustig van het hele gedoe in huis
7399699 if i didnt end up with mitchell i wouldnt have hannah
7399700 try to show her the way to deal with things
7399701 try to give her a strong sense of self esteem
7399702 woven into the mountains of appalachia along the scenic new river in southern west virginia
7399703 no model developer should be excused from this task and no self respecting science would settle for anything less
7399704 when the u s womens soccer team played very well it was not just about winning a gold medal it is about getting people outside to play sports especially for the young girls its good for the health of the country
7399705 how many people actually get to come to the olympics to play softball
7399706 i feel very confident softball will be back but you never know i felt really confident about winning the gold medal too
7399707 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world
7399708 and together we shared the excitement and drama of the games
7399709 this is our chance to hook up see people we havent seen in four years and exchange ideas
7399710 the convention is an experience of a lifetime and to be there with my best friend my mom is such a gift
7399711 sen dole inspired me and i am hoping to meet her
7399712 i would be thrilled to meet gov huckabee he is quite a leader and i hope to shake his hand
7399713 i cant even imagine what its going to be like to be in mile high stadium watching barack obama accept the nomination in front of 75 000 people

7399752 its a good time for people to sit down and unwind to just enjoy each others company
7399753 its hard in a way to play the devils advocate
7399754 because most people when they hear what were doing that were a store that promotes local and you have a voice in what your store is like people have a hard time arguing with that

7399756 co operatives are based on the values of self help self responsibility democracy equality equity and solidarity in the tradition of their founders co operative members believe in the ethical values of honesty openness social responsibility and caring for others
7399757 its not just somebody coming in from out of state or out of the area saying this is what you want and then taking the profit
7399758 instead we listen and we take that input and make it into a store
7399759 once we have a store and once we are making a profit all profit above and beyond expenses gets paid back to the members
7399760 the days where you could just find a space and set up shop are over
7399761 the city has had people who have been very supportive but the support has been limited by what they can do

7399763 this is an area in which more and more creative class people are residing
7399764 the food co op is exactly the type of grocery that this highly educated and food quality conscious group of people are demanding
7399765 the two major setbacks to establishing a co op in vancouver are funding and organizing
7399766 you go into one and you tend to know the people working there you have pride it in because its something you helped create
7399767 gt it is to be located somewhere in the lincoln carter park hough shumway arnada or esther short neighborhoods west of interstate 5 but east of kauffman avenue and south of 39th street
7399768 gt the co op is to be run by a board subject to the votes of those who buy shares in the venture at 180 each
7399769 gt food co ops are the new rage around the united states
7399770 gt as a community run business with a broad ownership base the vancouver goal is to connect shoppers vendors and growers around lifes primary requirement a secure healthy food supply
7399771 everyone talks about it from the city developers to the community leaders they all say we need a grocery store
7399772 gt in the shumway neighborhood chairwoman anne mcenerny ogle said
7399773 gt all omahoney and her fellow board members need to make it happen is money about a million dollars they figure
7399774 gt the store would operate like rei or portlands food front alberta co op grocery and peoples food co op
7399775 gt holly jarvis general manager of the 35 year old food front store has been advising the vancouver board
7399776 if people are buying shares and are willing to make loans then you can be pretty sure you are going to succeed
7399777 gt she said the demand for food co ops is exploding across the nation much of it in small towns that are losing their last grocery store
7399778 gt she said for example there is no expectation that the store will be
7399779 gt she said a long term goal is to use the store as a community center for example connecting to the schools and the farms locally
7399780 gt omahoney and the co op board are looking for a retail location that allows easy access from vancouvers oldest neighborhoods by bicycle automobile and bus
7399781 gt the idea came nearly five years ago when omahoneys friend heather layman suggested it would be a good idea
7399782 gt born in northern california omahoney 34 grew up on co op food
7399783 gt in organizing the co op the board targeted the area where a grocery store is most needed
7399784 gt they couldnt use the space in the current esther short commons building on eighth street she said because they dont have the money to rent it the market also has too little parking space and it isnt accessible to enough customers she said
7399785 gt in 2003 a group of clark county residents began organizing a cooperative grocery store to sell healthy locally grown food in west vancouver

7399806 here are some tips ive picked up over the years for spotting the big ticket item in a sea of dreck more experienced book buyers may want to skip this advice which may seem obvious to them for the record im a believer that condition is secondary to content i like clean bright copies with priced dust jackets who doesnt but when it comes to high value especially with non fiction i dont think condition matters that much here are a few guidelines to help you increase your profits 1 know how to spot a book club edition book club editions are generally a little smaller than the original edition lack a price on the dust jacket may have a dimple impressed mark on the back board near the base of the spine proviso 1 not every book club edition is a dud some true firsts were issued as bc editions but in general a smaller book with a dust jacket lacking a price and sporting a dimple on the back board is something for you to pass up even if its free proviso 2 the exception to the rule is sometimes university presses which may omit the price from the dust jacket 2 stay away from big books big books take up space they are hard to ship in a post internet world they are no longer as desirable as they once were look for the small book the priority mail flat rate envelope measures 9 12 you can send it anywhere in the world for a reasonable pice look for things that will fit into that envelope securely packed proviso if its a big book full of signed lithographs by chagall or matisse or miro ignore this advice also ignore if its an unusual binding has interesting stuff laid in has handwriting or limitation anywhere if you think youll never see it again then disregard the big book rule 3 stay away from reprint publishers is the publisher bonanza or dover in newer book does it say blue ribbon or modern library or everyman in older except with dust jackets in primo condition those are books that seldom bring a premium price not buying them is a good way not to have to figure out a way to re sell them proviso a reprint edition of a truly scarce title in a short run is sometimes an exception to the rule look for statement of limitation on the reprint or for a good foreword by somebody notable or for new material added 4 always check the paperbacks especially the science fiction poetry amp spiritual oddball paperbacks or titles with jazzy art or covers lots of good stuff in small editions came out in paperback sometimes these paperback command a nice price for example the true first of fahreheit 451 is a paperback lots of other good stuff is in paper back too like early city lights early grove press early new directions small presses of all kinds poetry of all kinds if its a beat title from the 1950s or 1960s in paper wraps even if its in shreds you probably want it in a sea of fat tall new paper you are looking for the short thin old paper 5 ephemera commands a premium two of my best recent sales illustrate the point i sold an incomplete issue of aspen 9 in portfolio wrps to a dealer in spain for 250 it wasnt in good condition and it wasnt all there he wanted it anyway i sold an april greimans does it make sense poster that was one of the first big pieces done on a mac computer to a graphic designer in denmark for 300 which i bought for 25 cents off the ground at the swap meet it was issued in a portfolio wraps by the walker art center i could tell the moment i had it in my hand that this was not a common item because it looked and felt unusual unsual with its portfolio design unusual size unusual production values both of these sold out of my ebay store where the price to list them was 3 cents for the month both sold the first month they were listed though neither had sold when listed at auction 6 check the back as well as the front of the item even the newest book dealer usually knows enough to figure out the information on copyright page and what the number line means if you dont know there are lots of guides to help you but its surprising how many people never look at the back of the book the last page or near the last page where there is sometimes quite a bit of additional information such as how many copies were printed the signature or mark of the printer if a small press the signature or mark of the author artist important other info also ads for the publishers other titles or the authors other titles all that information helps to justify a higher price repeat after you check the front then check the back 7 look for laid in material signatures inscriptions other factors that will make your book different from all the other copies offered is there a review of the book when it came out clipped and laid in a letter with a comment about it is there handwriting is it in ink does it look like something the author or illustrator might have written check it out is that somebody important take a chance on things with that kind of look or feel youd be surprised how often a little research will help to establish that your copy is unique 8 price isbn number zip code looking for older books or ephemera how can you tell if they are really old older books have lower prices printed on the dustjacket usually in the single digits prices like 3 or 4 50 on the flap usually means something published mid 20th century or a little earlier prices like 17 95 or 25 means not old same with paperbacks prices like 10 cents 15 cents 25 cents and 35 cents on cover mean an older book prices like 3 95 mean more recent doesnt matter what the copyright page says the price is the better indicator of age zip codes and isbn numbers are fairly recent inventions the absence of a zip code or an isbn number is a good start to establish that the book is older than the middle 1960s or early 1970s 9 look for esoteric subject matter in my case its ufo alien abduction para normal hypnotism alchemy off beat relion etc these are are all things that sell for me but almost all books and ephemera on off beat subjects have an audience if you think you once heard about it on coast to coast am in the wee hours chances are good somebody else wants it the more offbeat the theory the more ardent the seeker almost all of this stuff came out in small editions and was self published or published by very small and often defunct presses good prices on all of it just because you dont believe in it doesnt rule out the ready willing and able buyer on the other end 10 bound volumes of magazines are good really ratty bindings of bound volumes are even better it is my experience that libraries often toss the best and most interesting and valuable material into the free or discard pile or route them to the dump thats their mistake and you can profit from it im a sucker for old magazines like national geographics especially 1930s amp 1940s 1930s or vintage new yorkers any date farther back i like old harpers or bookman or studio or scribners from late 19th or early 20th century if the price is right take it and look at it carefully page by page for early appearances unusual technology vintage ads etc etc dont worry about the condition of the binding the binding doesnt matter do worry about the condition of the pages no worming no water stains no chipping if you plan to break it break it carefully and dont forget to pencil in the dates neatly on the pages 11 foreign language stuff is often good value ok so you dont read swedish japanese or russian or italian or czech or korean but trust me there are others who do and its a lot harder to find those books on this side of the water see something a little odd and its not in english take it is it signed even better does it have pictures terrific you want it last year i picked up for free about 20 titles in romanian i sold 19 of them at good prices 12 attitude counts in the old days selling books especially better older books was a small clubby world where people all knew each other and did business by mail and phone and through the ab there were only a few hundred name dealers and their reputations had been established by years in the trade and much diligence in the new internet world a lot of booksellers have been dealers about 10 minutes and they have no sense of being part of a trade that streches back hundreds of years if thats you remember this is a good business and one of the best ways to succeed in it is to treat the other members of the trade as friends and colleagues that means to share your specialized knowledge to be generous with people who are not as experienced or well versed as you are and to try to learn it as you go along by putting in the time and energy to understand the special language and practices of bookselling now there are hundreds of thousands maybe even millions of people selling books and a lot of them dont know zip so what we all started at that very same place once upon a time be generous be tolerant learn from your mistakes questions happy to

7399825 i am living in an apartment in san lois obispo and their concern for me is that i dont get burned out again
7399826 i am still doing concerts and preaching but now im learning to say no and i am not overextending myself now when i do teach and preach i preach mental health along with spiritual and physical health
7399827 we are a three fold being and if one gets imbalanced it affects the other and we cant be effective for christ if we are not spiritually physically and mentally sound we need to know those things and keep those things and be in tune so i am just thankful and praise god
7399828 thank you for making me feel that i am not a second rate citizen of heaven because i suffer from mental problems youve encouraged me
7399829 i would say to pastors that you need to wake up and realize that we are in a body of sin and death and depression is part of the curse
7399830 in my experience the christian church is full of people with mental and emotional problems resulting from an imbalance of chemicals in the brain its no different than having a physical illness such as diabetes and has nothing to do with the quality of their spiritual life many of these people among them true and faithful believers are treated as social pariahs because they havent got it all together like others without the disorder seem to have these folks are often misunderstood and many times shunned because they are different and do not readily fit in
7399831 our bible colleges and seminaries need to train future pastors on how to recognize the causes behind these mental disorders they are not always spiritual in nature but most often have a biochemical component that can be helped with proper medication and counseling
7399832 there should be no shame in having a mental illness because it is a no fault disorder there is no rhyme or reason for whom it attacks do you feel shame when you have a broken leg heart disease or high cholesterol in the same way christians shouldnt feel ashamed at having what amounts to a broken emotional system just because you have a mental illness doesnt mean that you cannot be a believer and it doesnt make you any less of a christian either

7399841 by placing more pressure on your feet as you stand or walk the joints and ligaments have to work harder to maintain foot structure and the more pressure your feet have to accommodate the more your feet will splay or stretch out when you bear weight overtime your feet will stop bouncing back and they will eventually just stay wider
7399842 we see peoples misery every day of the week and its not just those with weight problems our shop staff and our 24 7 helpline are helping more and more customers who are in so much discomfort they just dont know what to do
7399843 so many people especially women fail to wear the right shoes they will flog their feet to death in ill fitting footwear because they wrongly believe they cant buy the right style and fashions at the right price in wider larger foot sizes
7399844 more and more brides are spending their big day in pain on what should be the happiest day of their lives
