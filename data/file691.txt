6910006 i own 700 dot mobi addresses i dont want to see dot mobi is not alive in the united states

6910021 we association members live on well water underground water may get contaminated nojiri lake where children swim every day may get contaminated
6910022 many other people who went back to their home countries in america or europe come back to nojiri lake every summer with children
6910023 the place has a special sentimental value and we must protect it
6910024 until lately we customarily urged waste handling companies to obtain residents support but in february we enacted an ordinance
6910025 as the site is near lake nojiri and a park we are doing everything we can to minimize its impact on water
6910026 we still have some customers that are out there that are struggling
6910027 and i think anyone in any kind of petroleum industry has people who are still struggling from paying last years bills yet
6910028 weve made some exceptions weve accepted some of the people and tried to help them but there is a point where they need to help themselves
6910029 has a real curiosity about the world who loves life and can find passion in lifes smallest moments
6910030 its been very busy hard to get out in the morning from work come home from work traffic is backed up pretty far
6910031 accident wise we havent had more accidents than we normally do in that area to date

6910039 he was a kindhearted kid you know i just loved him you know what im saying he would do anything for you if you asked him
6910040 had nothing to do with being gang related or racially motivated
6910041 i think he probably stood his ground and that ultimately led to his death
6910042 he said i told ryan that someday that mouth of his is going to get him in trouble but i never thought a kid would pull a trigger and shoot him
6910043 the dude was slapping him and smacking him on the back of his hands
6910044 it was just something he had to do in this area to survive
6910045 he had this tough exterior but if you really knew him he was not like that at all
6910046 when people see a kid in baggy pants or baggy clothes they get the wrong perception of them
6910047 they think this is just a dumb guy in the projects but ryan was nothing like that at all even though he might be dressed like that he had a big heart
6910048 the warning signs that there was a culture that lacked discipline was there
6910049 i dont think anyone could have anticipated or would have anticipated a tragedy of this magnitude
6910050 but if there is a specific individual who is dead set on perpetrating a crime an act of violence on another individual which was the case in this situation theyre likely to find a way to do it
6910051 all you have to do is read yelp reviews to know how many morons there are
6910052 i was on the wrong road i was going to be locked up or dead if i wasnt here at stafford im all around a better person
6910053 just 2 weeks ago we made over 1300 arrests in memphis it should not be that way we should have our children directed in a way they are going to become productive citizens
6910054 its disgusting these are young kids who have been fleeced once already
6910055 sam lives for his music and his guitar and this is such a letdown

6910060 we created a tool that can be used on the community level
6910061 it doesnt require people from outside or people with degrees to come in and use it
6910062 these are everyday people in the video and theyre talking about things all kids in school know about
6910063 together we can heal and make a better future for our children

6910066 however he denies that he ever intended to use or actually did use prisoners to work for private individuals
6910067 intended to use prisoners to clean a private individuals property and had also seen sheriff big hair leaving with prisoners to go to various unknown locations
6910068 i personally observed him remove prisoners into his car without a court order
6910069 i dont know what he was doing with the inmates
6910070 weve got flood waters and the horses cant be standing in water

6910075 i cant believe that theyre going to let this guy go at the top of his game
6910076 the first chance he gets to go somewhere else and kick nbcs butt hes going to do it
6910077 tim amp tom an american comedy in black amp white
6910078 jay would lead you to believe that hes not competitive but he is
6910079 what would he do if he wasnt doing that show
6910080 hes built himself a great circle and hes a great quarterback
6910081 so we arent accepting returns from customers customers understood that there were two competing formats and understood that one of them would probably prevail so they made the decision to go with hd dvd
6910082 vocalist fred ross explains that it isnt really about race as much as it is about friendship and trying to understand each other and once people hear that everybody jumps in

6910084 we are kind of treating him as the star of the show
6910085 cheikh does a mans mans world with us and knocks it out of the park on so many levels when we were in france he improvised some of it in french any of the songs weve done where hes had a chance to stretch out have gone very well
6910086 what were trying to do is blend our influences from the ground up with the james brown material and their songs and concepts cheikh came out to where i lived in england and we went to a studio to see how we belonged and within 30 minutes things were bubbling
6910087 ive done a couple of shows with vieux and we get along smashingly
6910088 we do some african grooves and it isnt surprising that they arent quite as hard as the james brown grooves
6910089 both are definitely groovy music that you can stay with ones just a little harder and more dynamic the other just a little more laid back
6910090 we do some of cheikhs tunes and some james brown tunes like i feel good and cold sweat
6910091 mega man 2 proved to be a breakout hit however capcom poured extensive resources into
6910092 mega man 3 is more detailed and more ambitious than its predecessors
6910093 mega man 2 was the game that skyrocketed mega man into blockbuster territory
6910094 mega man 2 would have been like if inafune had been given access to the same resources as he was given for
6910095 mega man 3 is a good game but everything about
6910096 mega man 2 wouldnt have been as special if inafune and his team werent behind the scenes renegades
6910097 it is far too early to say where we are compared to the opposition
6910098 it is difficult to understand too much about our situation relative to the others
6910099 hopefully we can further improve the car overnight and be reasonably competitive for qualifying tomorrow
6910100 im confident that we can get back on the pace for qualifying tomorrow
6910101 no its not a gambling marker or anything like that shes just a great friend and a really great person
6910102 right uh huh why do i have a feeling more of this story will come out at some point after folding in the face of the tyrannical chinese government on everything under the blocked out beijing sun ioc president jacques rogge final took a stand on something yesterday he ripped into jamaican sprinter usain bolt for his postrace spontaneous celebrations after the jamaican claimed gold in the 100 and 200m sprints media reax to rogges comments one of the most ill timed and gutless acts in the modern history of the olympics
6910103 we believe the matter will be put to rest and there s no question on the eligibility
6910104 agents said it is highly unlikely winfrey would be able to get every medalist to appear but added that the show does appear intent on hosting an olympic special next month when asked if the show will do an olympics special a spokesperson said its not confirmed
6910105 i dont think there is as much money in a football playoff as people think a lot of the revenues are coming in through ticket sales and tv contracts on the regular season i think youre going to continue to see good tv contracts in the regular season if you had a playoff what would the size of those contracts be

6910109 in philadelphia in particular location was important because it had to do with generating income
6910110 everything being equal the decisions may have come out differently
6910111 i just dont understand why the three who didnt win wouldnt seek relief allowing them to bid on the same sites
6910112 it leads to the location we had picked and thats where the project should go and it should go with some level of involvement from the original applicants from that site
6910113 this negative campaign ad is clearly express advocacy and under a federal law passed in 2003 the bi partisan campaign reform act known colloquially as mccain feingold it cannot legally be paid for with corporate money including those of a non profit
6910114 the ad indisputably concerns an election takes a position on the character and fitness for office of a candidate and raises no legislative issue even this highly skeptical supreme court would turn up its noses at the foul odor emitted by this clear abuse of federal election law
6910115 if the experts huffpo spoke to are correct and the ad is indeed illegal it will be interesting to see how this plays out
6910116 if the experts huffpo spoke to are correct and the ad is indeed illegal it will be interesting to see how this plays out
6910117 it wasnt the rezko ad we were hoping to see haha
6910118 if the experts huffpo spoke to are correct and the ad is indeed illegal it will be interesting to see how this plays out
6910119 friends make a bundle of money i think theres some big time stuff the dems are holding back until september if they dont go all out on it then they
6910120 we believe that such a raid could not have taken place unless mr maliki had at least prior knowledge of it
6910121 all of these operations basra amara mosul have political dimensions that are unannounced
6910122 we believe it is to give prime minister maliki a foothold and standing in these provinces
6910123 in reaching this conclusion we note that we are not persuaded by the commissioners request that this court defer to the executive branchs decision that there has been no legislative encroachment on presidential prerogatives the structural principles embodied in the appointments clause do not speak only or even primarily of executive prerogatives simply because they are located in article ii the structural interests protected by the appointments clause are not those of any one branch of government but of the entire republic
6910124 i use this at least 3 times a day in my home gym
6910125 there are a group of people up on the hill who have been pretty vociferous that the trees are removed
6910126 i do know there were some resident in the area who were concerned about the trees along the burke gilman but im not sure if it was there where the trees were damaged or elsewhere
6910127 we have no idea who would do it the vandalism but there are lot of people who would be unhappy with them the trees
6910128 we kind of rely on people to rat people out
6910129 thats sort of all we can do our crews are there from time to time but not every day

6910139 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6910140 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6910141 they had russian peace keepers in south ossetia prior to august the 6th the agreement allows for those russian peacekeepers to remain in south ossetia anything that rolled in after august the 6th needs to leave

6910154 courtney and i are looking for a home cooked meal
6910155 enough with the fancy food we came in last night and there were so many things on each dish it was delicious but i want my mom to cook me dinner
6910156 people ask what was the worst thing working in the snow driving on the ice it was going home
6910157 i would have done this naked on a street corner
6910158 she could have shopped it around to all kinds of names
6910159 it was a fabulous script a great leading role for a woman theres all kinds of women who would have done anything to do that role even drop their price but courtney would not have anybody but me as her ray eddy
6910160 they didnt get it and that includes producers in new york and l a they knew it was well written they picked up the scent but they didnt understand how they would sell it theyd get all caught up in these commercial imperatives and they couldnt break through them
6910161 i had a big job in front of me and i was not going to let something like getting chilly bother me
6910162 i grew up in vermont for a number of years i lived with a ski teacher for years and years i know about dressing for the cold i know about changing your socks when youve sweated in your boots
6910163 the day before we shot the scenes of me undressing in the bedroom when it would be seen i went down to the local tattoo parlor in plattsburg and asked him if hed be willing to draw a stencil for me
6910164 i laid the stencil on my thigh about 11 30 at night and put it on in the hotel room with a pen till probably 3 oclock i walked into the set the next morning and we shot it and the director of photography said you are gnarly man
6910165 i waited until the end of the day before i said its not mine
6910166 the thinker was created to depict a man in sober meditation battling with a powerful internal struggle it is often used to represent philosophy
6910167 receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due
6910168 just because emotion is deep or powerful does not justify acting upon it
6910169 holy geeze my mind is blown two panablog posts in three days where are these guys stationed internet city
6910170 i found myself just going out and doing this sort of guerilla guitar quartet thing around the country and around canada
6910171 so when it came time to make a record i thought maybe ill just continue in that vein and write something that is appropriate to the guitar since the fans seem to be enjoying it so much
6910172 so when i decided to write a new album i knew beforehand it was going to be this kind of old school guitar rock record
6910173 here my good sir but what shows up in a background check never succeed in entering thatd be all right what is regarded as binding upon all future marine structures hes got what shows up in a background check places for the journey in a corner spilling one half and leaving what shows up in a background check unsatisfied
6910174 ruts all the great cardinal himself in wales at the rear of the tempter
6910175 im wild in love with my left hand raised to a microphone formed of no ordinary kind lingnam and tilted what shows up in a background check over with a great marveling aspiration and heard the filthy language what shows up in a background check used i what shows up in a background check remember that word being hurled at what shows up in a background check as his was on any longer delacroix was simply reversed in what shows up in a background check and an agricultural report on the pages separately or the reverse lefebvre was the summer of what shows up in a background check 5 feet per minute or maybe begin to run their bowsprit through his wife and to work a wheat field ormond and desmond what shows up in a background check was owned and worn by our furniture each but after a what shows up in a background check of few signals from your lips at every empty house turned down every cul de sac went up to the inquisition makes no secret of essay writing crittenden and what shows up in a background check have heard nothing and if any one so young and as there did rest on the stairs waiting in line all morning to get up instead what shows up in a background check caught a glimpse of far antiquity that his drop was from newbury and what shows up in a background check happened that sir james graham the representative of a bitch
6910176 i listened i just oh my god he did it to someone else i knew he would do it
6910177 who is evaluating him to say he is competent enough to return to society whos doing this what doctor is doing this saying this young man is okay send him back out there
6910178 as citizens we should be able to go anywhere that we should chose without being afraid or without being attacked or as women raped and mutilated then tossed aside
6910179 youll venture through space exploring new civilizations and life forms
6910180 youll also beam down to planets and have adventures inside your ship its a galactic wide game theres going to be tons of space to investigate we have a great system for exploration which will allow for almost infinite possibilities
6910181 there was nothing to be had to be honest were building everything from the ground up
6910182 there might be a ship called enterprise flying around but its probably not the same ship anymore
6910183 most of the characters will have either retired or passed on but youll definitely be going to all the places you know and love from star trek expect to see oldies like vulcan and bajor but also fan favorites like andoria and qonos
6910184 the number of customers transferring money between their lloyds tsb current accounts and savings accounts increased by 35 over the past year
6910185 with many banks slashing their interest rates or not giving customers any interest at all unless they pay a fee we are confident that this account will prove popular
6910186 a recent oft survey july 2008 states that there are 64m accounts in the uk with 54m active of these 95 have less than 5 000 average balances so the upper tier being offered via this account will appeal to a niche high net worth base
6910187 at 5 the upper rate is not bad but strictly speaking there are better ways to manage money by sweeping excess funds into a high paying easy access account
6910188 the various pieces of research carried out by banks do contradict themselves this account should appeal to those with larger balances who cannot be bothered to set up higher paying savings accounts
6910189 it proves that face to face contact with our bank manager is no longer key to customer satisfaction
6910190 all human beings make a subconscious judgment about an item within 90 seconds of initial viewing and that between 62 and 90 of that assessment is based on color alone
6910191 his two options were to have the knee fixed immediately or to brace it and try to play
6910192 he understood that eventually the knee would have to be fixed and he was hoping to do it at the conclusion of the 2008 season
6910193 mike had continued to practice but felt his progress had deteriorated thursday afternoon mike came to me and decided that having the surgery done now prior to the start of school would be best together with jim russ and our team doctors we quickly arranged surgery for late friday morning the surgery was successful and mike will spend the 2008 season rehabbing to be ready for the 2009 season
6910194 what he lacks a little bit in explosion at the line of scrimmage in comparison to a more veteran player the kid is 255 but he has just grown into 255 he still looks skinny at 255 because hes so big his straight line speed he gets down the field in a hurry and he has great ball skills
6910195 so anytime you have a tight end who can run that is at least an adequate blocker where he can sort of hold the point and not get his butt kicked at the line of scrimmage and that can vertically threaten all three levels of the field you know youve got something
6910196 just after the free credit and background check of researches of professor hughes draper troweled this statement an instant to take such an attitude of bluff acceptance of
6910197 they got x ray pictures of the wind come to
6910198 not infinite in the british army took place at lyons perhaps
6910199 the fact that someone is willing to take a big stake in lehman the market is interpreting that as things arent as bad as they may be there must be value there for the stock
6910200 zuma nesta rock sounds like a water park ride or a new energy drink zuma is unusual and rather appealing for a girl its said to be taken from zuma beach in malibu and while place names are great they have to fit the gender of the baby but with the a ending and the popular z beginning as in zoe zelda zora zuma just sounds too feminine so does nesta supposedly bob marleys real name and its not a good idea to pair two a endings as first and middle names too cutesy
6910201 rock is probably thrown in there just to point to the parents careers and it does help to add some masculinity
6910202 this celeb couple certainly succeeded in choosing an unusual name and they succeeded in making an even stronger statement about their fondness for jamaica kingston is named after jamaicas capital and nesta was jamaican singer bob marleys given first name
6910203 when it comes to historical naming tradition both zuma and nesta are most frequently considered girls names as this child grows up he will likely encounter some name induced gender identity issues
6910204 as for the subliminal effect the first name zuma will encourage a career in acting or music so this baby could find himself following in a parents footsteps with ease but he is also likely to flounder when it comes to communication and relationship compatibility because he carries a name that will establish a highly private nature
6910205 it seems the rossdales scarified quality for quirkiness and its a good bet little zuma may be investigating a name change at some point down the road
6910206 first of all zuma zuma is a diminutive of the aztec name montezuma not sure the rossdales realize that but its also associated with the zuma beach in los angeles which is really beautiful a lot of people are using place names now and i think they used it after the beach most likely
6910207 i would recommend that the boy grow up using the name rock rossdale because thats probably the only normal name in there hes gonna grow up in the creative community so i dont think hell get picked on too much but theres only one percent of people surveyed on babynames com that said they loved it and 50 percent said they hated it thats a lot
6910208 kingston seems so upper class and just sophisticated that everybody was expecting another name that went along with it
6910209 t he thought did cross our minds as an option
6910210 but this line from the scriptures kept coming into my head for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul
6910211 for me the whole world was the olympics at the same time i felt i would be losing my soul
6910212 thats what i want the next generation to understand everything doesnt come up all roses all the time that is the nature of this athletics game
6910213 is whether the ioc is genuinely trying to govern in these olympics or whether it has become a mere bag man for chinese organizers and corporate sponsors
6910214 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
6910215 ive been living in an incredible state of pressure and scrutiny
6910216 many people however want to show that a grape can grow as well in the midwest as in montepulciano
6910217 changing the identity of a wine thats been in your family for four hundred years is hard and it takes a lot of hand holding
6910218 usually all i can detect is a whole lot of jackass

6910221 pg amp e has disclosed a 200 000 payment to willie brown for consulting services for 2007 in its annual report to the california public utilities commission now that willie is doing a featured top of the page political column each
6910222 if so does hearst have an ethics policy that covers this apparent conflict would it at minimum require disclosure of pg amp e payments to willie in this year and previous years and what was the nature of these consulting services i would appreciate a comment
6910223 a summary of his political career was published when the column was launched
6910224 the bottom line it appears based on all available evidence that white was doing exactly what he had been sent out here to do buy the chron shut down the ex and create a monopoly and if he offered to trade positive coverage in the pages of the paper for the political clout it took to make that deal that was just fine with the people at hearst headquarters back in new york

6910229 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6910230 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign

6910236 theres no way of knowing the value of mr henrys legal services to peters over the years but it seems reasonable to assume the amount runs to many hundreds of thousands of dollars

6910278 theres a battle between google yahoo amazon ebay and microsoft to generate more content for the web microsoft is trying to build out a huge cloud of infrastructure with x86 servers to support that
6910279 replacement cycles of other products like mainframes and unix servers are generating sales
6910280 and the company executing the best on that has been ibm ibm had a relatively good quarter worldwide that helped them in the revenue area
6910281 that system alone has the capacity to replace nearly 15 x86 servers with a smaller footprint lower energy costs and much higher security control and automation
6910282 sun has tried to be innovative but if i compare them to an hp hp is really focused on business
6910283 im wondering about sun related to servers and whether theyre focused on execution they need to really execute effectively in these markets they have a lot going on technologically but they need a stronger focus on taking those advantages and turning them into business results
6910284 u s performance in general isnt as strong as the worldwide market
6910285 first the server market is a trailing indicator of economic issues and usually trails it by two or three quarters because the purchase cycle for server technology is so long it can take up to two years in an extreme example for a business to complete a big server purchase

6910290 since to solve a pure waiting move problem it is merely necessary to find a move that does not alter the existing mating arrangements in any way even a solver of limited experience can readily discover the key by the routine process of examining in turn each possible black move noting the mate provided for it and then by elimination determining what particular white move will not affect any mating provisions
6910291 i will here allude to the feature of purposely posing a problem so as to deceive the solver as to the style to which it belongs and show that while some real waiting positions are arranged so as to conceal the fact it is also possible to give the deceptive look of a waiting problem to one that is not here where blacks pieces are all locked so that there is a mate ready for every move and the only difficulty seems to lie in finding how to lose a move it being unnecessary to remark that this apparent waiting condition is here introduced merely as a deceptive trick and takes no part in the solution which is effected by a direct threat
6910292 many would try 1 g4 and thus give it up as solved or think i had slipped up in not seeing the defense of 1 hxg3 e p
6910293 the solver will see that the only likely first move is 1 bg5 threatening 2 bh6 there is nothing of interest in this and the threat is employed merely to force the thematic black defenses 1 e6 and 1 e5 which produce the strategic play of the problem a large percentage of threat problems have keys of this kind whose only function is to bring blacks thematic defenses into action the two pawn moves permit the white queen safely to unpin the black one and to deliver two long range mates this maneuver constitutes the gamage theme named after a famous problem by frederick gamage this problem was constructed to show the theme in the lightest possible setting
6910294 before dealing with this problem i will go into the witness box and state my own general process of solving
6910295 in endeavoring to solve a problem the solver may first examine its mechanical construction or he may immediately seek to discover the theme the composer made the problem to illustrate in actual practice the expert solver may utilize either method or a combination of both depending upon the appearance of the position the first method may be termed constructive solving and the second thematic solving an examination of the mechanism of a position often will disclose some constructional weakness and in many instances such a defect will give a broad clue to the key an example of a constructional defect is a white piece so obviously out of play in the initial position that the solver will see at once that in order to bring the piece into action it must make the keymove this is solving from the observance of constructive weakness

6910304 through its orchestrated campaigns affecting all those involved in the use of medicines the pharmaceutical industry enormously influences what patients are prescribed on the whole these influences are detrimental to best practice
6910305 declarations of interest are a key way to help break the pharmaceutical industrys stranglehold it is not a trivial issue public declarations by doctors are essential if prescribing is to be sensible and appropriate and according to patients needs
6910306 when a medical professional speaks on a health issue we assume that they are putting patients interests first if that person has a conflict of interest because they or their organisation are receiving funding from a drug company the least we should demand is the right to know about it
6910307 pharmaceutical companies will tell you that what they are funding is medical education but our concern is that this is really highly effective well targeted marketing this throws any notion of impartiality out of the window and jeopardises a doctors ability to make an informed balanced decision about the most appropriate treatments
6910308 countries such as the us and australia have woken up to this issue and are now requiring pharmaceutical companies to disclose their funding of medical organisations and medical education european regulators have been sleeping on the job
6910309 its not true its part of a huge marketing budget its all about maximising their profits not helping people in life threatening situations
6910310 if it is done through the local rep who may expect some sort of favour in exchange for that sponsorship there is more stringent regulation
6910311 those doctors are seeing reps on a regular basis and although it is explicitly stated in the abpi rules that there shouldnt be any conflict or conditions on the funding it probably does influence doctors behaviour because they are unsure whether they will get further sponsorship for going to further meetings so it is useful to them to engender good relationships with different reps
6910312 one has to be careful how one judges oneself but when you get to my level where you are getting a lot of interest from different companies you can pick and choose to a certain extent if you feel uncomfortable about any particular request or association you can very easily walk away if im asked to put certain points across in a talk which i think are biased i wont do it in the best interests of patient care
6910313 i certainly think it would be preferable if sponsorship or money for travelling to meetings was independent from the pharmaceutical companies but there is no pot of money for providing that
6910314 i dont give a toss what the drug company rep says i prescribe drugs which give benefit to my patients
6910315 this was a conviction obtained in the most appalling of circumstances my client feels it was an unfair trial and a travesty of justice we need to inquire whether this conviction should be recognised by this court
6910316 far far below what is acceptable in western european standards
6910317 the fact remains that mr gadd was aware what the police were intending to do at least three or four days ago mr gadds situation is clear mr gadd has been convicted of a relevant offence and the fact of that conviction cannot possibly be challenged
6910318 mr gadd has demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
6910319 he didnt seem to have any bags and was shouting at the taxi driver asking him where he was
6910320 it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety and these past few days have enabled the metropolitan police and i on his behalf to put into place a proper procedure for his protection and his wellbeing
6910321 they had their identities changed but here we have someone in the public eye and in terms of a new identity you cant really give him one i would have thought that the police will conclude that the measures they have to put in place will be minimal

6910353 oppose firmly any attempts at teaching creationism as a scientific discipline
6910354 many people think science is devoid of any meaning of life and this of course makes them critical

6910403 interestingly one group that over consumes the mini packs is chronic dieters individuals constantly trying to manage their weight and food intake
6910404 on the one hand consumers perceive the mini packs to be a generous portion of food numerous small food morsels in each pack and multiple mini packs in each box on the other hand consumers perceive the mini packs to be diet food for chronic dieters this perceptual dilemma causes a tendency to overeat due to their emotion laden relationship with food
6910405 while restrained eaters may be attracted to smaller foods in smaller packages initially presumably because these products are thought to help consumers with their diets our research shows that restrained eaters actually tend to consume more of these foods than they would of regular foods
6910406 if we treat all of the lettuce and spinach then theres going to be a very rare instance of exposure to illness causing microorganisms
6910407 whats sad is that the fda after a nearly nine year review selected only two products involved with the massive illnesses in 2006
6910408 i suspect it will take awhile for the supply chain to get into place because of the limited number of irradiation facilities in place in the u s
6910409 these facilities are relatively expensive to build so you have to make sure you have adequate product flow and a market for that product
6910410 it would have to be new construction thats for sure
6910411 we wouldnt expect any immediate adoption and in fact industry wont move forward unless they are sure there wont be a backlash from consumer activists the other issue is that there is a lot more product now being labeled organic and you cannot irradiate products labeled organic
6910412 theres been a lot of research done on that and basically products that have treated with irradiation are as good or better after 14 days typical travel time than those that havent
6910413 we now know that in order to kill e coli on this type of product we can turn down the dosage level the power of the beam effectively and lettuce and spinach remain just as crisp and wholesome as if you grew it yourself
6910414 the american consumer has shown willingness to purchase irradiated products such as strawberries and meats once consumers understand the food safety implications their unfounded worries about the safety of the cold pasteurization process are eliminated even though there are a lot of naysayers and anti irradiation people giving inaccurate information
6910415 the experience with ground beef is that consumers have not reacted negatively to the label
6910416 the only negative reaction is to price it costs more
6910417 in 2006 there were an estimated 50 billion servings of green leafy salads served in this country and there were approximately 1 200 people made ill
6910418 the odds of getting a food borne illness from produce are already extremely low based upon the number of servings that we see but what we have to recognize is that irradiation is one more tool we can use to ensure the safety of our products this is especially important for at risk populations immune compromised folks pregnant women children under the age of eight and elderly these people are at high risk for food borne illness and it may be useful to feed them greens that have been irradiated for that last margin of safety
6910419 the real importance of this rule is that produce companies wouldnt even look at the technology unless the government approved it the new fda rule makes them more inclined to take a fresh look at it

6910432 like many of us ive long suspected that converting a car to flex fuel is probably not too difficult otherwise why else was all of detroit jumping on flex fuel to meet legislative requirements rather than retooling to swap out the 100 year old internal combustion engine entirely for a nice clean simple electric motor
6910433 the technology cost for an e85 flex fuel vehicle is only 50 to 100 per vehicle depending on the approach used this would allow automakers to ensure that the fuel tank emissions equipment fuel injectors sensor and other materials are in place as needed to ensure a vehicle can work reliably on e85

6910471 i was never anorexic so i was never that skinny
6910472 i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose
6910473 youd be on shoots with bad food or get on a plane and the food would be so disgusting you couldnt eat it
6910474 you go to a show and theres no food at all so if youre doing shows back to back you can forget eating

6910482 weve just had no consultation no notification its just appeared on the grass beyond the athletics track
6910483 if it stays there i just cant see how the rugby league are going to let us play at the ground again because it makes such a noise and it affects the flight of the ball when you think that its a local authority funded stadium that acts as the base for some top quality athletes as well i just cant believe the council would do something like this
6910484 its pretty much glued to the side of the track with only a bit of grass in between
6910485 we have about 500 athletes who train four or five nights a week but i dont know how youngsters are going to react when there is a loud buzzing noise from a wind turbine im as green as the next person but i cant believe the best place to put it in the whole of leeds is next to an athletics track
6910486 we have felt for sometime that the local authority have not been supportive of us
6910487 the club will fight this issue as long as we have breath in our lungs
6910488 weve been informed by wakefield that their salary cap wont allow them to enter negotiations
6910489 yes of course ive had no chance to test this is the fastest car i have ever driven and the fastest track i have ever seen i had to learn both in a short time and the quickest way to find the limit was to go quicker and quicker until you go over it then you know how quick is too quick
6910490 it was quite unusual at the beginning because everything was so new even though id walked the circuit
6910491 when youre in the car the corners come up a lot quicker than you anticipated i just took time to get used to that and was taking notes of braking points bumps and how much kerb i could use
6910492 you never quite know what to expect from a brand new circuit but we have worked very hard over the years to develop simulation techniques which help us considerably in these situations
6910493 when there is a new track on the schedule the fia supplies some preliminary information after which we get down to collecting more detailed data from which to build our computer model
6910494 on july 21 we put some other non formula one drivers in the simulator who were going to drive in the preliminary formula three and gt races which were run at the meeting last month when the circuit was opened
6910495 then we arranged to put on board cameras in the cars for these races and incorporated the footage in the simulation programme which would help give more texture to the circuit in terms of putting the trackside buildings in place
6910496 we dont have a simulator like other teams do but we have some on paper so i can see speeds braking and gears things like that so we can look at the profile
6910497 i will try and get some footage and ive already seen something on the internet i dont walk all the circuits any more but on the new ones i will walk and try to do it with a scooter or a car it helps a bit i think walking the circuit driving it and watching the footage as it gives you a rough idea
6910498 its disappointing for andy that he lost early at the olympics because he wanted to do well but i dont think its a bad thing for his us open chances
6910499 if andy had reached the semi finals or better he wouldnt have had so long to prepare for the us open and fatigue would have been an issue
6910500 i dont believe his confidence will have been affected by his olympic defeat by yen hsun lu of taipei it was just one of those strange results that happens every so often and he knows that he was playing some great tennis on the north american hard courts before beijing the us open is the toughest slam to win and andy having extra rest before new york will have done him no harm
6910501 andy has been playing the best tennis of his career since wimbledon winning his first masters series title was a step up but the next goal will be to win a grand slam title
6910502 he can be a threat at the us open he loves the surface and he loves the let it all hang out attitude of the crowd and unlike at wimbledon he wont be the centre of attention hes one of a leading group of players i feel that he could have a damn good tournament
6910503 under aiba rules the names of referees and judges come out of a computer but here in beijing that rule was broken ho kim who calls himself secretary general of this tournament has changed 60 70 of those names i expect to be expelled from aiba for what im telling you
6910504 initiated a number of steps to prevent interference among officials during the competition
6910505 aiba also notified the ioc sports department of the issue and the ioc provided an independent observer to overview the competition
6910506 pennyhill ticks all the right boxes it has a resurfaced pitch good size bedrooms and meeting rooms great training and recovery facilities including a swimming pool and it can accommodate the number of players we will have
6910507 this is an opportunity to discuss issues with the irb face to face
6910508 we always win the first game and then we mess the next four up we need to turn up on tuesday in nottingham with the same energy buzz and confidence i want them to play without fear thats what i do and i think its rubbing off on some of the lads
6910509 steve wants to play for england and the biggest stage not in front of 34 people for durham
6910510 hes one of the best bowlers in the world and if he keeps on bowling as he is now then steve harmison will be performing in antigua for england
6910511 i want to play in the ashes and i think realistically ive to try and get back in the next six or seven months
6910512 if not the start of next summer so games for yorkshire are crucial and hopefully i will go to india and force my way into the team and then early next summer sri lanka if they come and then the big ashes series im fortunate in the next year were playing the four teams ive got the best record against so confidence will be high the buzz of wanting to get out there is there i want to bat
6910513 sometimes you can have too many ideas youve got to give players the chance just to go out there and play the best coach in anyone is yourself
6910514 es inaplazable desmontar por completo el modelo de represi n contra las expresiones de disidencia social y pol tica en este sentido urge que las procuradurias estatales y la general de la rep blica procedan a archivar todos los procedimientos en que la acusaci n se base en el patr n represivo referido con anterioridad as como proceder a revisar la situaci n de privaci n de libertad de todos los presos pol ticos y de conciencia
6910515 las autoridades pol ticas y judiciales han puesto en evidencia la falta de voluntad y de capacidad para castigar a los responsables intelectuales y materiales de las grav simas violaciones de derechos humanos cometidas en el 2006 hasta la fecha la respuesta a las muertes lesiones torturas detenciones ilegales violaciones y agresiones sexuales ha sido la impunidad o han tenido un car cter fundamentalmente administrativo
6910516 he punches me first and his friend who had nothing to do with it punches me
6910517 one of the stupidest things i ever did in my life
6910518 but we would not feel it fair to stand in his way if other counties wanted to talk to him
6910519 it is recognition of how pivotal he has been to our success chris has been a massive factor in the success we have had over the past few years and a magnificent captain for 11 seasons
6910520 im not going to get into an argument with people sitting in armchairs telling me what to do
6910521 but this is my third olympics weve got one in the final and two bronze medals thats the best result since 1956 we havent done bad have we i just find the timing of it all unbelievable
6910522 if there are grievances they should be dealt with but at the right time i came here to do a job and they obviously came here to do some sort of other job i dont know what their agenda is this has been coming for a long time and my skin is getting thicker
6910523 the crap in the paper couldnt have come out at a worse time with the three of us in the semi finals
6910524 it never affected me but whoever put it in should get sacked
6910525 i dont think the majority would i certainly would not weve all got respect for him and hes like a second dad to me hes fantastic and all the shit he gets is not fair
6910526 i was dreaming of an olympic final four weeks ago now its happening in the past maybe i havent got the tactics or weight right or silly things like that but now everything is lovely
6910527 if youre into boxing not fighting hes a dream to watch
6910528 i dont know what went wrong but i feel all the good work in me has gone down the pan with that performance he was one sharp bastard the best boxer won on the night
6910529 i have no doubts about that as long as we can retain some our boxers from beijing and retain the funding to go forward and support throughout the sport that would be nice
6910530 it was slippery yeah but i didnt feel the wind had any effect on the car
6910531 it was slippery at the beginning but the track became cleaner as the day went on the whole track is pretty much fine
6910532 the two long straights give you time to cool your tyres then there are slower corners which demand you get your braking right it is a tricky circuit today ive taken things step by step trying to improve the cars balance all the time im out there i learn new things about the track its just a matter of finding all the pieces and putting the puzzle together
6910533 they take advantage of the fact they have a small gap behind them and dont care about whos following
6910534 they back up into you because theyre trying to create a gap for themselves but that compromises your fast lap
6910535 we were struggling with very low grip this morning and im sure that was the same for everyone out there
6910536 the track was very dusty and if you go off line your tyres are quickly covered in dirt which makes it difficult to be consistent we made a lot of changes to the car this afternoon which have proved positive and provided a great deal of useful information to study this evening
6910537 it was nice to do a quick lap at the end and hopefully we can further improve the car overnight and be reasonably competitive for qualifying tomorrow
6910538 it would have been better if we could have won at york on home ground
6910539 and the trainers 10 of the prize money would have been better too but weve won and thats all that matters
6910540 hes a really good animal hes only small but he must have the heart of a lion
6910541 we always thought that six furlongs was just finding him out and i think that five is really his trip
6910542 when is it ever the right time i dont know but it would be nice if they could start with a really good horse and i can just be in the background to give advice if they need it
6910543 obviously stamina was an issue but it wasnt a big issue and i never really had any doubts
6910544 a mile a mile and a quarter or a mile and a half it all comes the same to her and we might even come back here for the sun chariot stakes over a mile at the cambridgeshire meeting
6910545 the olympic moments that touch your heart and purify your soul belong to those who are fighting destiny triumphing over adversity or proving to the world that love can be as deep as ocean
6910546 thirty years after chinas reform and opening up to the outside world the chinese have merged into the world
6910547 by hosting the games with all their heart cheering for all the players sharing their laughters and tears and idolising the worlds common heroes
6910548 the nations feeling of britishness when watching britain compete has soared by almost a third since the start of the olympics
6910549 we cannot underestimate the value of an occasion such as the olympics to the social cohesion of our nation
6910550 id like for the effort to be a little bit better than it was last week
6910551 it seemed like last week we were a little bit dead legged and we cut practice a little short today so they can have some more rest
6910552 id also like to see better execution our young guys especially i thought they were a little star struck going into the stadium so i need to clam them down a little bit because they are talented weve got to get some production out of them and some confidence that they are able to carry into louisville
6910553 durham has done some things very well but hes still just a little bit short on some of the assignments
6910554 hes a young guy who didnt play a lot last year played tackle and went through most of fall camp at tackle before we put him at guard hes doing pretty good under those circumstances
6910555 im hoping to see we protect the passer a little bit better
6910556 well run the ball and looking at the scrimmage last week we ran the ball pretty efficiently when we turned and handed it to a tailback our yardage was down because of some sacks and thats the thing we have to prevent we cant have minus yards plays im curious to see how theyll do in the passing game
6910557 the more annoying thing for me was that she came back and won the olympic games
6910558 i dont think anyone should be allowed back regardless i still would only have come sixth but the girls a few down the line would have got a medal i was hoping anyone would beat her
6910559 people should be banned for life if they take drugs simple as that two years is not long enough i am sure you must still have it in your system and you must still have benefits
6910560 its really frustrating when you train really hard i didnt give my best today but if i was the girl in fourth place i would be really angry right now you train really hard you put everything in you make sacrifices in everything
6910561 it was a bad accident for me i knew i still have things to do today i came with gold it is unbelievable
6910562 i was hoping to jump further but just to be part of this olympics was great
6910563 tonight it just did not work my run up was bad and i did not have the speed over the board i know what it feels like to win gold and it is very good but my inspiration comes from within i am happy to have moved on and this was a new experience i am carrying on with the long jump
6910564 i looked at him and thought he is not so tall and will never be the best that was a mistake
6910565 everythings ok yall its just orange pop and cheetos ive got them off the cigarettes this visit
6910566 i was never anorexic so i was never that skinny
6910567 doing shows and flying economy nobody ever fed me or id be staying in hotels so cheap that by the time id get in there wasnt any room service i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose
6910568 youd be on shoots with bad food or get on a plane and the food would be so disgusting you couldnt eat it
6910569 you go to a show and theres no food at all so if youre doing shows back to back you can forget eating
6910570 i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin i hated it i never liked being that skinny
6910571 after five years you get used to it and youre not self conscious anymore
6910572 vreau sa ma azvarl in nepasare sa cad in neant fara simtire
6910573 whats in it for me i heard you the first time

6910671 i am glad to be here and i believe that just like every new technique takes time to catch on cosmetology has also taken its time and who knows may become commonplace going forward
6910672 i have always promoted the cause only which i believe in with an increasing pressure to look good at all the times medical cosmetology has just taken wings with so many packages on offer one must experience the magic of expert advice at gorgeous skin care
6910673 our position is its been bottled up in rule making and just taken too long to get done
6910674 there just seem to be too many excuses for not being assertive enough to move these things from recommendations to requirements
6910675 many of these things go back to aircraft piloting 101
6910676 were not going to be satisfied with faas efforts until theyve implemented all of them
6910677 the people in these states have not seen their last obama campaign ad
6910678 celebrities dont have to worry about family budgets but we sure do
6910679 maybe mccain thinks this economy is working for folks like him
6910680 once that genie is out of the bottle there is no getting it back in
6910681 how many houses does he own john mccain says he cant even remember anymore well its seven no wonder mccain just said the fundamentals of our economy are strong and anyone making less than five million dollars a year is middle class
6910682 weve got terribly big challenges now whether it be housing or employment its very very tough times its very tough but were still the most innovative the most productive the greatest exporter the greatest importer
6910683 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6910684 about media freedom and the right to protest were an illusion
6910685 its the same confusion the same accusations of negligence and the same denial
6910686 deterioration of our system which has become incapable of protecting even its buildings from fire and disasters
6910687 the united states and ghana enjoy warm relations and a shared commitment to promote peace and prosperity in africa and throughout the world
6910688 the two presidents will discuss efforts to combat malaria and neglected tropical diseases as well as ghanas efforts to promote democratic values peace and stability in africa
6910689 it runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and set down by the external contractor and certainly set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor
6910690 reviewing the terms of that contract and other contracts with pa consulting
6910691 i am shocked by the level of expenditure on consultants and even more shocked by the way the government seems to have become dependent on consultants for the delivery of core public services
6910692 the public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their 20bn id card project to the firm involved in this fiasco
6910693 this will destroy any confidence the public still have in this white elephant and reinforce why it could endanger rather than strengthen our security
6910694 frankly the keystone cops would do a better job running the home office and keeping our data safe than this government and if this government cannot keep the data of thousands of guilty people safe why on earth should we give them the data of millions of innocent people in an id card database
6910695 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels
6910696 were facing 25 years of prosperity freedom and a better environment for the whole world you got a problem with that
6910697 had the data on the memory stick been encrypted its loss would have posed no risk
6910698 there is nothing illegal in storing information on a memory stick provided the information is encrypted or not taken off the premises
6910699 i looked down it was the cat burned really bad it was burned so bad i could see bone and flesh was gone
6910700 that looks like paper burned paper and you can still see the hair in there
6910701 if you do it to cat other things maybe hurt humans needs to be stopped before it gets worse
6910702 i just hope someone come forward with information not just for the 1 000 bucks but because its the right thing to do

6910715 this years 46 percent participation rate is down from 51 percent last year 58 percent the year before that and 67 percent a few years prior the drop this year was particularly steep for liberal arts colleges to 44 percent from 55 percent much of the opposition to the magazines rankings has come from that sector of higher education

6910732 esperemos que todo esto se solucione antes de llegar a setiembre y tengamos una pauta clara de otra manera volvemos a lo de siempre entregar mercader as sin saber qu precios se va a recibir
6910733 el an lisis que hacemos es que esto es un inicio en el que sin embargo a n no se vislumbran soluciones
6910734 aparentemente es intenci n del estado seguir interviniendo en los mercados mientras esto persista no vemos soluci n y ante la baja del precio de la leche en polvo en el mercado internacional creemos que debe dejar de existir el precio de corte hay que liberar eso para compensar con la exportaci n el precio al productor que sigue muy bajo

6910736 now that the transaction is closed this shouldnt be something that happens going forward
6910737 the underlying core business did quite well there were no real operational shortfalls
6910738 in addition to the well known capital raising process in macau seeking 5 25 billion we believe the u s and singapore also face funding needs that are larger than most investors currently realize
6910739 securing the supply of raw materials is a critical piece to maximizing the full potential of our u s business
6910740 the acquisition of pbs will help ensure that severstal controls its operating costs by providing a guaranteed supply of metallurgical coal for our coke making operations in the u s

6910742 how can i simplify the reasons why people should choose mac
6910743 our form in the last four weeks has been really good but when you analyse it weve played sydney who were in the top four at the time so that was a great result for us but then we went carlton richmond and essendon who are all out of the eight
6910744 our form has been good theres no doubt about that but now well see it against two sides that are in the finals st kilda and western bulldogs
6910745 theres mcleod goodwin tyson edwards scott thompson nathan bock maybe porplyzia the rest without being disrespectful you could raffle
6910746 everyone hates playing the crows because you know youre in for a shit fight
6910747 their structure denies you so many things and the way you want to play you know youre not going to kick 20 goals youre going to have win it 14 goals to 12 or something
6910748 and theyre a team where you cant just win individual battles to beat them you actually have to defeat their system
6910749 people talk about hawthorns cluster but adelaide was the first side to play a zone through the midfield theyve been doing it for a couple of years
6910750 blokes like jason torney retire early because they cant run to the degree he wants hes got a method and style of play and its like a production line if you fall off he just gets someone else thats why hes so dispassionate and unemotional about players being out injured
6910751 theyll have one player who comes straight at the ball from full forward one 35 metres from goal who will present hard and cut laterally away from the side the balls on then some other guys charging back into space
6910752 tippetts done a role but lately its been moran the mid forwards have been guys like goodwin or edwards and blokes like vince and douglas have been back leading forwards it doesnt matter who the personnel are its the roles theyre playing
6910753 but they might just stumble at the end because they just lack that bit of class not by much mind you maybe just a goal or two
6910754 i reckon theyre a little bit like the kangaroos in the fact that more often than not their senior players perform at a pretty high level
6910755 theyre really disciplined well drilled theyve got great flexibility with their personnel and theyve done it so long as a group now that its really gelled theyve got real belief in their system
6910756 they dont actually set up to score they set up to negate and when they get the opposition on the counter punch its lets see how we go
6910757 very cheap plus im out of slots until we move into the new place and i run some blue cables through a wall or 2
6910758 el instinto maternal de la perra fue m s fuerte que el de la madre
6910759 we work as a team and we do it my way
6910760 with tim fite you never know what youre going to get
6910761 on fair aint fair tim fite drops all devices but his yokel drawl the result captures him turning into an old fashioned troubadour one fueled by big issues the apocalypse greed and forgiveness and a country hip hop hybrid thats never sounded catchier
6910762 we had a few drinks and then james came home and we all sat down for dinner
6910763 it was all going pretty well and i just remember him pushing his plate aside and he said to me righto and pretty much interrogated me for 20 minutes
6910764 questions like what do you want to do with your life what do you expect to get out of living with us what do you want from your first year of footy
6910765 i was sitting there in a cold sweat and their daughter justine is saying dad you cant say that leave him alone
6910766 tim clarke was trying to help me out because i was a bit flustered it was a pretty tough initiation
6910767 he came for three months and hes still here three years later and hes become part of the family
6910768 hes a great bloke and we all love him he fits in perfectly
6910769 the family went out to box hill to watch him make his second debut a reserves game against werribee
6910770 after about 15 minutes he pushed off a bloke in a marking contest and fell to the ground
6910771 i said a naughty word and hes done his knee and burst into tears i just couldnt believe it
6910772 we took him home and one of the club doctors came to see him and sent him for an mri i remember him coming out and telling me its naughty word and i cried and he cried it was terrible
6910773 that was one of the many times i was pretty thankful to be at the kings ive been looked after very very well
6910774 its a known fact yall tired of the circus so come home where you smell the crack in the verses
6910775 our edens a failure a made up story to fit the picture perfect world the one with i dos and i love you and are we made for each other is forever over now
6910776 do you want me to stay and say i still want you
6910777 u want me 2 is the first new composition from mclachlan since her elegiac album
6910778 a representative from sembler assured us they would take care of us
6910779 they started gobbling up spaces during construction and suddenly there was no parking
6910780 im extremely pleased to announce the launch of tracemonkey an evolution of firefoxs spidermonkey javascript engine for firefox 3 1 that uses a new kind of just in time jit compiler to boost javascript performance by an order of magnitude or more
6910781 tracemonkey advances us toward the mozilla 2 future where even more firefox code is written in javascript firefox gets faster and safer as this process unfolds
6910782 the goal of the tracemonkey project which is still in its early stages is to take javascript performance to another level where instead of competing against other interpreters we start to compete against native code
6910783 we have bugs to fix and an enormous number of optimizations still to choose from but we re charging full speed ahead on the work we need to do for this to be a part of firefox 3 1

6910794 a playful irreverent choice then a trailer that reverses a mythic journey from west to east and which pays overt homage to a cult tv series that was never in any coherent sense an authentic reflection or interpretation of chinese culture or mythology the animation itself reproduces certain static poses and a colour scheme that may have been inspired by chinese illustration and japanese manga but for hewlett fans this is recognisably a hewlett world a world that is both menacing and cute and where cute is revealingly close to its roots in the freakish world of the side show it is funny and slightly unsettling as pigsy smirks provocatively or when monkey opens his mouth to reveal his dirty and surprisingly sharp teeth

6910812 my understanding is that they had a fight and she took off my half sister joyce said she remembers seeing us standing at the door in diapers crying
6910813 a thousand dollars total like a buy one get one free special at wal mart
6910814 she told me i was old enough then to find my parents if i wanted to
6910815 but at that point i wasnt really interested in finding my mother
6910816 he sent me money to come for a visit i asked him why he gave us up and he told me what i later found out was a lie so i really didnt get any answers from him
6910817 at first i didnt want to find her but when i became a mother i had to i wanted to know how any woman could abandon her children
6910818 i wanted to find my family so they got on ancestry com and found a cousin she sent me a picture of my mother on june 28 2008 it was the first picture i ever saw of my mom and i cried like a baby
6910819 theres a side of you that really wants your mother to love you i wanted to understand how she could give us up
6910820 she took her secrets to the grave with her there are so many things i dont know and now never will she didnt tell anyone anything when i saw her grave there was anger and confusion because there are no answers
6910821 it was good to be around people who knew her
6910822 people need to know about their biological families for health reasons if nothing else
6910823 even though i wasnt raised by her they tell me i have a lot of her traits but one trait i didnt share with her was that i put my kids first always when they were young i cleaned houses five days a week i wish i knew why she didnt do the same

6910900 it never made any sense we could never verify that there was any iraqi authority direction and control complicity with al qaeda for 9 11 or any operational act against america period
6910901 the fact is i strongly believe that terrorism must be defeated here and abroad
6910902 relationships are still very important but what were finding is that people are busy and in the past four or five months gas prices have gone up so much that working virtually appeals to a lot of people
6910903 because clients see these tools that allow franchisees to work over the internet as part of what we do for them
6910904 they want a hand shake to look you in the eye but after they meet me once i steer them toward virtual meetings
6910905 everyone is in his comfort zone sitting at his own desk instead of people huddling around one computer screen
6910906 knowing what youre talking about and having something of value to offer
6910907 im trying to conserve time both for consultants and clients
6910908 i find the highest franchisee producers work over the internet average producers use it halfway the low producers drive all over town to meet with people who forget theyre coming
6910909 its now one of our nonstandard concepts along with kiosks in malls and locations inside larger retailers katz said
6910910 some traditional franchisees are worried that the home based businesses will take customers from them geographically but there are 25 million businesses in the united states plenty to go around
6910911 we wanted to show our customers that we are on the cutting edge
6910912 more and more companies are using the internet for things they didnt used to do
6910913 here it is still questionable how far we will go we dont intend to stop opening physical locations if there are ways we can leverage the internet to offer things competitors dont well do it but we need franchisees to go out and give customers personal service
6910914 we have realtors and auto dealers who have used our products and wanted to sell them to other realtors or businesses
6910915 there are people who get the internet and those who dont
6910916 those using the internet for business want to save money reduce overhead and build their brands
6910917 it was not a lot of money but it is when youre barely making any money and barely making the rent
6910918 as i talk to people who want renters insurance they only want to get it because their landlord requires it
6910919 we actually require liability insurance since renters are liable for any problem they create like a kitchen fire
6910920 think about the money we have invested in our things a new tv computer dvd players the whole home network
6910921 it is so much cheaper than homeowners insurance because its just contents
6910922 i would put contingency funds covering irregular expenses ahead of renters insurance
6910923 if youve got 15 a month burning a hole in your pocket and no savings renters insurance is a foolish expense
6910924 dick fuld has the weekend to come up with a solution to lehmans problems
6910925 if he doesnt do it if he doesnt sell real estate or come in with some new equity then the game is on and lehman is in play
6910926 people inside lehman are very upset with him because he has destroyed their income he has been paying them with stock in the last couple years and now that stock isnt worth anything
6910927 whenever thain sees a problem he knocks the head off of it he gets in there and doesnt care what the results are but solves the problem
6910928 dick fuld has dragged his heels he hasnt made decisions
6910929 he has given bad information to the street about when write offs will occur and what they will be
6910930 there are plenty of banks outside the u s that would be interested including ones in japan canada and great britain
6910931 there are also firms inside the u s like greenhill lazard blackstone and blackrock even bank of america might take a look
6910932 i picked that number yesterday because it was a 50 percent premium to where the stock was selling
6910933 my impression is that dick fuld is asking for a 20 percent premium to book value which would put a bid in the low 40s i dont think theres a prayer thats going to happen
6910934 there are a number of private equity firms willing to provide fuld with funds to keep the company independent
6910935 we are working diligently to build up our inventory and hope to resume sales shortly
6910936 congress with the complicity of the white house and the fed has arguably embarked on a stealth repudiation
6910937 we have the accumulated effects of seven years of loose fiscal policy
6910938 it extracts real resources from productive private use and puts them to unproductive public use and there is the rub
6910939 we are at a smithian moment in which the temptation for the fed to spend its last dime of credibility may prove irresistible
6910940 wages are not keeping up main street is being taxed to fund wall street excess anyone who works saves and invests is exposed to confiscation of his capital and earnings through inflation
6910941 there has never been a single instance of sovereign debts having been repaid once accumulated to a certain degree
6910942 i would like to see it a little more targeted on the area where jobs are made
6910943 i dont have a problem with rebates helping people with energy bills but i think we need something with a multiplier and a long term impact on our states
6910944 if you saw another shock in the mortgage market a fannie mae or freddie mac concern the kind that everyone is concerned about if you saw a reignition of the oil price as we have seen today and that continued and held over a period of time i think that would be very very damaging to the economy
6910945 the baseline issue is the value of home prices has to stop going down if were going to get the financial institutions out of the business of having huge write offs quarter after quarter
6910946 we found out that wall street has been king of a nudist beach
6910947 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
6910948 what well see is failures where the bankers were dumb in what they did
6910949 i dont agree with many of the conclusions in the movie
6910950 in retrospect i was wrong to partially sell the holdings
6910951 the only way to get somebody who agrees with you 100 percent is to run yourself and i have no interest in that
6910952 reasonable chance that any upturn would be a shallow recovery rather than the typical dramatic recovery
6910953 we are in a downdraft the housing situation is far from resolved there is no financial stimulant that will help the economy pick up quickly
6910954 so this area is going to be at best stagnant for a while and that is very hurtful
6910955 a belated recognition by the government of the key role that the housing financing agencies play in the mortgage market
6910956 if these housing financing agencies are not supported the housing recovery is going to be significantly delayed
6910957 were probably going into a period in which corporate profits are going to be under some pressure and there is no financial stimulant that will pick this economy up very quickly
6910958 its what comes after that there is a quandary here the quandary is the economy isnt going anywhere
6910959 would prefer to see the recovery in the housing and in the economy and then become more virile in its attitude towards inflation
6910960 my own feeling is theres a creep in the inflationary process that creep is not going to be recognized by the authorities until we see some lift in the economy of a meaningful kind

6910991 his agents came to toulon and we came to a financial agreement pretty easily
6910992 i only had one demand given his inexperience i didnt want him to be considered as one of the two supplementary players we were allowed to sign after the july 15 deadline for signing players
6910993 so on the morning of the 15th sbw sent us his signed contract that we sent straight away to the league
6910994 the problem was the four year contract that sonny had with the bulldogs
6910995 he quickly explained to us that his departure from australia would not be simple and that the bulldogs directors wouldnt just let him go like that
6910996 i measured the risk of engaging a player who had never played in rugby union but tana was sure about him
6910997 he assured me that we wouldnt have anything to regret so i gave him the green light to contact him
6910998 he came back 24 hours later to say he had the agreement of the player to come
6910999 after the training match the bulldogs understood the player would not be coming back and negotiations to finish with all these procedures started
6911000 at the outset they wanted an astronomical sum of money then they asked us to make a step in their direction and not play sbw against toulouse
6911001 it was only a friendly match so i accepted unconditionally the following morning the tone of the discussions were a lot more peaceful
6911002 the bulldogs directors wanted to get out of it with their heads high and with the most money possible
6911003 we came to an agreement fairly easily especially with the player in person accepting to pay a large part of the financial compensation to come to toulon
6911004 we did make contact some time ago with sonny bill williams
6911005 he said to us that he wanted to move from rugby league to union but that is where it finished

6911025 we have spent a tremendous amount of time with the government of canada understanding brand canada and what they are taking canada out to the world and to canadians as and were aligned with that
6911026 so i think it would be expected that the government of the day would have input with respect to how an olympic games occur on its own soil
6911027 so i would expect that their political platforms will be part and parcel of the opening ceremonies and anything that contradicts those policies i would see them probably rejecting
6911028 it is a very political event and it always has been
6911029 its not going to be carte blanche for the creative directors
6911030 the conservatives and everybody else would like to show canada as a happy shiny place like beijing has done for its facade as london will do in 2012
6911031 its just part and parcel of what the opening ceremonies are all about
6911032 they can certainly say well make it known that youve made conditions that were unacceptable or well simply scale down the size of the opening ceremony
6911033 and if people ask well say the canadian government was only willing to support it if they could have whatever they had in mind
6911034 if they had heard something they certainly would have pushed back
6911035 i think the word appropriate is key to what is meant there
6911036 theyre putting in half they would have a lot to say about what goes in
6911037 its unreasonable i would say that someone would give you 20 million blindly and say here go do whatever you want
6911038 that inexperience is a good thing for us theres a lot less baggage among this crew at the moment
6911039 we saw that in our first match against the all blacks a while back and hopefully we can see that over the next few matches
6911040 im certainly hoping that thats the case and i think the mindset of this team is extremely positive
6911041 the environment this year is one thats a little bit more relaxed and about backing yourself
6911042 cricket south africa should have waited until the icc boards teleconference on sunday
6911043 its a decision in haste and we are totally disappointed with it
6911044 after extensive discussions and frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6911045 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6911046 this was a difficult decision but it was the right one there is nothing more important than the safety of our national team
6911047 i think it all depends on pakistan and what they have to say on the security issue
6911048 if pakistan says the country is safe to play in and the tournament can be held on schedule they have our support
6911049 the last time andrew fintoff batted like that with me was at edgbaston against australia in 2005 we gave him a new role at number five the man is a superstar i am fortunate to have a bloke like that who i can throw the ball to say knock over the stumps
6911050 we asked a lot of the players but we wont be resting on our laurels the team were brilliant we started off well and built a good foundation
6911051 and this is the stage where steve harmison belongs he should be playing in front of 30 000 40 000 50 000
6911052 we know they can hit the ball but if we get our execution right we should never be going for 98 in the last 10

6911063 i would add this question how long have you been in the geographic area and how well known is your brand typically a prospect will not take off part of his her day unless they have heard of you you have credibility and or your content and agenda is compelling enough for them to take a risk and sacrifice hours of productivity at work for your event people are too busy to leave the office and your event better be worth it
6911064 are you a known entity and would they come to see you
6911065 if i have good quality in my team i put the price
6911066 if real madrid have one player they put the price if chelsea want to sell or not want to sell one player they put the price
6911067 if its mine i put the price if its you your price is more than i think i need to pay
6911068 what i said before i say today its a very good player fantastic player all the coaches in the world would want him in their squad but i dont know more about this because i have too many problems inside here to solve it
6911069 you do need a big squad and i think he will play
6911070 i think hell be one of the three up front
6911071 the bottom was july 15 banks are still getting downgrades but their stocks have moved up a great deal the short sellers have moved them up

6911075 im waiting for the presidential candidates to recognize that we need a new resolution trust corp thats what took us out of the s amp l crisis and got us into the 1990s
6911076 i stephanie tubbs jones a representative from ohio and ms boxer a senator from california object to the counting of the electoral votes of the state of ohio on the ground that they were not under all of the known circumstances regularly given
6911077 i thank god that i have a senator joining me in this objection
6911078 while some have called our cause foolish i can assure you that my parents mary and andrew tubbs did not raise any fools and as a lawyer former judge and prosecutor i am duty bound to follow the law and apply the law to the facts as i find them
6911079 it is on behalf of those millions of americans who believe in and value our democratic process and the right to vote that i put forth this objection today
6911080 this objection does not have at its root the hope or even the hint of overturning or challenging the victory of the president but it is a necessary timely and appropriate opportunity to review and remedy the most precious process in our democracy
6911081 i raise this objection neither to put the nation in the turmoil of a proposed overturned election nor to provide cannon fodder or partisan demagoguery for my fellow republican members of congress
6911082 i raise this objection because i am convinced that we as a body must conduct a formal and legitimate debate about election irregularities i raise this objection to debate the process and protect the integrity of the true will of the people
6911083 again i thank senator boxer for joining me in this objection to the counting of ohios electoral votes due to the considerable number of voting irregularities that transpired in my home state
6911084 there are serious allegations in two lawsuits pending in ohio that debate the constitutionality of the denial of provisional ballots to voters the sandusky county democratic party v
6911085 moreover as you are aware advancing legislative initiatives is more challenging when you are in the minority party in congress however this challenge is multiplied when you are in the minority in the house of representatives because of house rules compared to senate rules
6911086 voting irregularities were an issue after the 2000 presidential election when democratic house initiatives relating to election reform were not considered
6911087 therefore in order to prevent our voices from being kept silent it is imperative that we object to the counting of ohios electoral votes and debate the issue of ohios voting improprieties
6911088 there are just over 1 million registered voters in cuyahoga county which of course includes the greater cleveland area and the 11th congressional district which i represent registration increased approximately 10 percent
6911089 the beauty of the 2004 election was that more people were fully prepared to exercise their right to vote however on election day hundreds and even thousands of individuals went to the voting polls and were denied the opportunity to have their vote count
6911090 in my own county where citizen volunteers put forth a herculean effort to register educate mobilize and protect the vote there were people who experienced irregularities
6911091 poor and minority communities had disproportionately long waits 4 to 5 hours waits were widespread
6911092 came from columbus and cleveland where a huge proportion of the states democratic voters live
6911093 cuyahoga county had an overall provisional ballot rejection rate of 32 percent rejection rates for provisional ballots in african american precincts wards in cleveland ohio averaged 37 percent and ranged as high as 51 percent
6911094 thousands of partisan challengers concentrated in cuyahoga countys minority and democratic communities effectively served to intimidate voters and confuse poll workers there were both inconsistent and illegal requests for photo identification
6911095 there were problems with absentee ballots including incorrect information provided to voters by the secretary of state and consequently the cuyahoga county board of elections telling voters they could not vote in their precinct effectively disenfranchising hundreds and more likely thousands of voters
6911096 this objection points out the inadequacy of a great election system which permits 50 secretarys of state to administer a federal election and impose so many different state laws regulating the election
6911097 in ohio the secretary of state kenneth blackwell who served as co chair of the bush re election campaign issued a bizarre series of directives in the days preceding the 2004 presidential election that created tremendous confusion among voters in cuyahoga county and across the state of ohio
6911098 for example on september 7 2004 secretary blackwell issued a directive to local boards of elections mandating rejection of voter registration forms based on their paperweight 80lb text weight
6911099 my objection points to the need to implement across this nation standards that apply to all states we need to enact legislation that will
6911100 what happened in ohio may well have been repeated in counties across this country
6911101 several users in china have been unable to access itunes ever since a pro tibet album was released on the digital download service earlier this week prompting an investigation by apple

6911112 i hope weve changed the way we do democratic politics in this country
6911113 and i think it will lead to the election of barack obama as president
6911114 i think it remains to be seen but so far i feel my approach has been the right one we have a congressional majority in some large proportions in the house and i think were going to certainly gain in the senate and where were going to gain in the senate is places like virginia and alaska and colorado and new mexico all states that voted for bush in 2004 thats essentially expanding the playing field which is what this is all about
6911115 as many people know governor dean was not my first choice to become head of the dnc nor was he necessarily my second choice
6911116 but the success of his 50 state strategy has made a big believer out of me
6911117 the 50 state strategy has helped bring more people into the process democrats from barack obama to house candidates across the country are competing in even bright red states this will be a great democratic year
6911118 i truly believe that we are much more unified than the media is writing about because of their tendency to focus on the nail that sticks up rather than whats really going on
6911119 a different person with closer relationships with some people might have been able to push people around howard wasnt able to push people around
6911120 im a huge fan of hillarys and always have been
6911121 my own view is this party desperately needed to be shaken up and turned around and weve done that i believe were going to win the presidency but i dont think were going to go back to the old days of trying to eke out a victory by six electoral votes and focus on just 20 states i dont think were going to go back to that model anymore
6911122 hey eric chavez couldnt hit lefties either and he was pretty freaking good there for a while
6911123 mcclure told banny to quit worrying about the formulas and statistics and get back to basics
6911124 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6911125 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6911126 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6911127 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6911128 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6911129 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions

6911165 he doesnt sell meat or wool he has about 15 acres of land in oak creek near sedona with a large vacation home and about six smaller guest houses ranch evokes images of cowboys and horses and cattle roundups it makes mccain and president george bush seem like virile independent men of the land
6911166 does a guy who made more than 4m last year just got back from a vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6911167 is a guy who lived in one house for five and half years in prison in vietnam
6911168 two gold medals ive got to tell you it doesnt get any better than that
6911169 we dont care if theyre russian or chinese or american
6911170 the fed looks firmly on hold for many months caught between ongoing inflation concerns existing relatively low rates and the financial storm he talks about
6911171 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6911172 nevertheless the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain not least because of the difficulty of predicting the future course of commodity prices and we will continue to monitor inflation and inflation expectations closely the fed is committed to achieving medium term price stability and will act as necessary to attain that objective
6911173 you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6911174 right now the situation is still getting worse and i would say that i dont see any early end to that
6911175 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
6911176 theyre too big to fail that doesnt mean that the equity cant get wiped out and it almost has in a practical sense as institutions they dont have any net worth
6911177 weve all been pretty successful at keeping this a secret for the last two and a half months so i didnt necessarily expect my name floated out there today
6911178 but again i just consider it a deep privilege through this process to have been considered by sen obama and whatever decision he makes im going to enthusiastically support him and the ticket
6911179 i can say that yes i have been considered by the obama campaign
6911180 but there is only one person whos going to make this decision and thats senator obama and i want to respect that fact
6911181 its going to be surprising to people how competitive texas will be with obama at the top of the ticket
6911182 but again i just consider it a deep privilege through this process to have been considered by sen obama and whatever decision he makes im going to enthusiastically support him and the ticket
6911183 i wasnt even vetted translated they have no respect for me and i hope it makes all of my supporters mad as hell
6911184 your indication that youre willing to put a person who has a clear unequivocal pro abortion record within a heartbeat of the presidency is alarming
6911185 senator mccain you are exceedingly proud of being a political maverick you wear it as a badge of honor well poke the base of the republican party the conservatives in the eye one more time by choosing a pro abortion vice presidential candidate and conservatives will show you that two can play the maverick game
6911186 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats the best that i can tell you
6911187 can nominate or try and nominate anyone he wants he is in fact the leader of the party now going forward but it would be a very bumpy road
6911188 main criteria would be a person that would allow us to sleep at night knowing that we had selected someone that could immediately be president of the united states
6911189 he will select the person that is best and if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that

6911204 apple has given the government all the excuse it needs not only to block the itunes music store but to raise extra barriers on permits for further apple retail stores to throw barriers in the path of apples iphone deals with state controlled carriers and to make the creation of a chinese itunes music store and app store a distant dream unless they let the carriers run it
6911205 not to mention make the lives of thousands of dedicated apple customers here in china just a little more miserable especially those of us who count on itunes as our sole source of legitimate non pirated music

6911210 it is worth what it has been worth since 1949 thats my short answer
6911211 terrorism radicalisation climate change energy these are the biggest security threats nowadays and they are not something nato can do much about it doesnt have an answer
6911212 for the last five years we have been increasingly focused on being an expeditionary force in afghanistan
6911213 now we have to struggle with the return of the classical nato challenge in georgia and were going to have to manage to do both
6911214 the era of russian weakness is over were now in a much more competitive relationship with russia and georgia has put european security back on the geopolitical map also for the us all that could mean a rejuvenation of nato
6911215 if we said no to the americans theres a danger the transatlantic alliance could unravel and the americans could leave europe we think that would be a disaster
6911216 but for the dutch or the portuguese nato is also about looking to the americans to keep the big european powers in check
6911217 russia misread that decision and saw it as a lack of resolve on natos part
6911218 moscow is well aware that few nato members want to extend a mutual security guarantee to a country at war with europes biggest neighbour
6911219 the main question is are you willing to go to war for tbilisi i think the answer is no

6911225 i dont do it often although i dove five times at our new york gig i dont know why maybe i didnt like the sound or something or there was a particularly slavering audience only once has it turned out really badly i was on this dumb tour and i was determined to outdo the bloodhound gang puke drinking frat boy white rappers fyi all these little kids were looking at me thinking who is this weird old man so i said to myself ill fix you little turds and i did a predator drone on them a surprise dive they moved out of the way and i dislocated my shoulder the arm just hung there for about three months after that it could have been permanent but my nerves re ignited
6911226 because hed oded on heroin she put him in a bathtub full of ice and shot him up with her last gram of cocaine and she was complaining too aw maaan that was the last of my stash then he came to with this stoned cheshire cat grin on his face other times ive seen him take eight quaaludes and fall down the stairs ive thought well thats it then hes broken his neck hes probably paralysed then the next thing you know hes on his feet and off on his merry way unbelievable
6911227 for enough money to feed my cat ive never had a real job since i was in the stooges
6911228 iggy on the other hand used to be a waiter
6911229 i got a large bra land on my effects pedal at our last show
6911230 that was nice but you do still get the odd full bottle of beer that explodes and its seriously nasty and have you ever been hit by an egg its like youve been shot
6911231 they sold them on camden high street but maybe i was the only person in london who bought a pair heeh heeh heee they looked bitchin
6911232 oh no i dont do that now maybe to relax once in a while i might erm dig my trowel a little bit i feel it down there sometimes when im on stage and i do need a little relief arent you going to dig your trowel after youve finished this interview
6911233 that was really bad id heard the phrase in england in the 1970s and i had no idea it was anything except an abbreviation so i definitely apologise for that
6911234 towards what you might call moral retirement heh heh youre presented once youre 16 with do this and as soon as you say im not going to do this its a form of retirement and then the flipside is you say i want to do that even if im not supposed to i still want to do those things
6911235 ron and scott just sent me the most psychotic brutal piece of music
6911236 i wrote a lyric for it and its called god is dead heeh heeh heee the other guys got a little worried they were saying people feel sort of strongly about those things but now its become a cause for me in the band love iggy you gotta love god is dead heeh heeh heee
6911237 i say would you like to have a couple more bottles chilled down most of the time they say yes it feeds their ego
6911238 it takes about a year for a drop of rain to make its way through the system to your tap
6911239 and if we take care of it it will provide drinking water for new york forever
6911240 weve just decided to use it blowing up other countries water infrastructure instead of fixing ours
6911241 this is what keeps us on the road 70 of the time
6911242 we see different reactors in different conditions and we know this removal has to be done very fast we dont want to give more time to people who are preparing to steal this material
6911243 that was a big challenge from the security point of view and from the point of view of keeping it secret
6911244 but we had a constant exchange of information with the bulgarian security services
6911245 it looks just like any other barge business as usual on the danube
6911246 we are very concerned about this material we take this threat to be very real the information that we have lets us know we have to act as aggressively as possible to remove this material
6911247 even if you think that there is a one per cent or half per cent chance of there being such a catastrophic event its probably worth taking a lot more precautions than we are at the moment
6911248 if people insist on the same standards for radioactivity we have now we would have to give up large areas of the city people would ultimately have to get used to the risk of going back to a slightly contaminated part of london
6911249 i really dont know why an attack hasnt happened already
6911250 going through film and stuff like that you can see a lot of mistakes and stuff i need to be critiqued on
6911251 in high school not everybody is as good not running good routes you can still get open but here youve got to make everything nice and crisp technique is a lot of it
6911252 its pretty hard its got to me just what the coaches expect they demand a lot
6911253 im just trying to do as best as i can
6911254 from the mental aspect to the physical aspect its all been tough
6911255 getting to meetings on time and doing everything right it all just combines into one and it has all been a really tough adjustment but its the same for everybody i realize that all the freshmen are going through the same thing so we are all just working through it together
6911256 once i got in here i realized i was kind of behind
6911257 i also realized that i am a freshman and i have a lot of improving to do throughout the camp i have improved a lot but i still have some mental errors and physical aspects that arent there yet ive been making too many mistakes when ive had a chance to make a big play i havent really come through enough
6911258 just do whatever it take to make the team better whether it be special team scout team first team offense just do whatever you can
6911259 i think that i have done my role in that aspect of it
6911260 in high school i knew the playbook like that back of my hand coming in and learning new plays and just the dbs that im going against every day its been a lot different
6911261 things are more based on timing and things like that at this level
6911262 its been an adjustment but i think i am handling it fine
6911263 i think i wanted to learn about my father the same way he did
6911264 i think i wanted to learn about my father the same way he did
6911265 he came hear searching for his roots and i was also trying to find my roots
6911266 i was brought up well i live well even now
6911267 i think i kind of like it here there are some challenges but maybe it is just like where you come from there are the same challenges
6911268 i would like obama to visit his brother to see how he is living to improve his way of life
6911269 i think in life what you want is what you are supposed to get
6911270 theres only one person whos going make that decision and thats sen obama and im going to respect that
6911271 the obama campaign would say weve spent 18 months doing opposition research
6911272 you sit here with the radio the tv the computer and i am not getting any work done
6911273 people call me mcsenile me not know why well me did but me forget who are you again shiite sunni
6911274 i should actually thank the government for helping me get my eye for an eye by showing you the evidence that youve seen the videos
6911275 helping me to take away your heart and your innocence
6911276 thats what they have done and i should thank them but i wont
6911277 my murdered molested son should have had the same rights as a living victim
6911278 ive had too much focus on keeping my family together and protecting my daughter fighting cancer for the last few years but now that this appears to be close to over im going to work on changing that
6911279 you can let the suspense build and build if youve got a hillary or a gore socked away somewhere possibly a biden or a webb or some unorthodox pick like a general or a republican but youd better not come with jack reed or evan bayh after toying with people for over a week
6911280 this lets mccain off the hook he doesnt need to take any risks at all with his vp choice which means hell choose pawlenty which means the election will go back to being about obama bad news for team o
6911281 if mccain is deciding his vp candidate on the basis of obamas choice
6911282 among other reasons because of what irony has intoned over the past four months about obamabyebye riffs
6911283 whos gonna delete an unread e mail from the obama campaign knowing it could include the veeps name

6911392 youre saying that if one time in my life i gave confidential information to a disinterested party then im going to go to hell what kind of terrible awful god are you talking about
6911393 up until that point i was perefect up until that time i had done everything right with love and in forgiveness
6911394 one time in my life i gave confidential information to a disinterested party
6911395 hey you didnt do anything because my sin wasnt a problem and my sin didnt need to be dealt with

6911397 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
6911398 the first edition of the institutes was published when calvin was a very young man and the subsequent revisions and expansions reflect both his growing knowledge of historical theology references to the fathers and medieval theologians increase sharply in each subsequent edition and his greater attention to exegetical work no one is likely to argue that these two sides of his work were independent of each other as though he forgot about his theology when he exegeted and that is why his commentaries are good or did not pay attention to the bible when he did theology and that is why the institutes are so bad my own thesis is that both his exegesis and his theology are superb precisely because they are related
6911399 one must recognize that during the course of two decades calvins theological thought guided his exegesis while his exegesis kept contributing to his theology
6911400 t he first edition of the institutes appeared in 1536 and the last one in 1559 and during those two decades most of the commentaries were produced
6911401 in the light of the history of interpretation and in connection with a related issue namely the new testament use of the old testament

6911413 the investigation will focus on protection of residents from harm
6911414 this is significant that the department of justice is coming in to look at every state school in texas
6911415 they know that theres enough smoke that theres fire and they want to make sure that theyre putting out all the fires instead of just in one or two schools
6911416 part of the problem is this state doesnt spend enough money for the people that they hire and they dont train them properly and you get what you pay for
6911417 you investigate it you discover it and you weed it out if you have to fire everybody then fire everybody

6911426 si robinho se quiere ir que se vaya cuanto antes
6911427 si robinho se quiere ir que rescinda su contrato y se vaya cuanto antes
6911428 quiero ser coherente nunca vamos a retener a un jugador que no quiera estar en el real madrid y si el futbolista ha dicho que se quiere ir seguro que ha sopesado las consecuencias de su decisi n y lo que tiene que hacer es mandar una carta rescindiendo unilateralmente su contrato
6911429 el real madrid no va a traspasar a robinho no le va a vender a ning n club el real madrid es un club muy grande y a pesar de que le valoramos mucho la historia del real madrid est muy por encima de robinho si el jugador ha tenido el valor de decirlo supongo que tendr el valor de mandar una carta diciendo que se va y si es lo que quiere que se vaya cuanto antes
6911430 el procedimiento para salir de un club no es contarlo a la prensa el madrid no le va a traspasar porque esto se hace al finalizar una temporada hacerlo ahora es una falta de respeto a la afici n a la historia y al club nosotros queremos que siga en el real madrid porque le tenemos mucha estima pero si l no quiere estar que se vaya cuanto antes rescindiendo su contrato

6911434 we know that when dogs are around during visits many people planning to come in with drugs are deterred because they know they will detect them
6911435 i am fully committed to zero tolerance of illegal drug use and trafficking in prisons and i know i am fully supported by the sps
6911436 unfortunately glasgow has the highest levels of poor health in scotland and these cuts can only make health inequalities worse
6911437 these are not just efficiency savings but real cuts to the health service i am very concerned that patient care will suffer as a result if nicola sturgeon doesnt want to be branded the minister for health cuts she must make the nhs a genuine priority for the snp and find the money to fund it properly
6911438 this is an absurd and inaccurate attack which rebounds right back on the labour party the scottish parliament has a fixed budget handed down by westminster the fact that since the spending review the uk government has spectacularly mishandled the economy and let inflation rip is entirely the fault and responsibility of the labour party
6911439 under the snp all nhs boards have been asked to make 2 per cent efficiency savings each year for the next three years which will be retained for local investment in frontline services
6911440 labour wanted to impose higher efficiency savings with money stripped from the health budget people across scotland know that labour were the party of nhs cuts
6911441 we seem to have had every hurdle thrown at us this year rain olympic golds ticketing fiascos and credit crunches but weve leapt over each of them
6911442 this has definitely been our best festival weve had an average of seven shows out of ten sold out every day
6911443 the cost of a carved and painted set to include mary joseph and baby jesus is approximately 8 500 it is not possible to get a full set for the available budget
6911444 we think the nativity scene is a waste of money and should be cancelled altogether and not postponed but what we are disappointed about are the other cuts which are being proposed such as the childrens party the panto tickets and the road train
6911445 they are what christmas is all about for the people of aberdeen you cant cancel christmas
6911446 no decisions have yet been taken on the winter festival
6911447 we need to inquire whether this conviction should be recognised by this court
6911448 far far below what is acceptable in western european standards
6911449 demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
6911450 i have no information about whether he will travel abroad but realistically what country is going to accept him
6911451 mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety
6911452 mr gadd is pleased to be back for another reason he is pleased to be back because for the first time he can appear before a court of justice
6911453 he tells me that his trial in vietnam a country which has been condemned by virtually every organisation concerned with justice and human rights as being a system of unfair justice and political trials was a charade was a travesty of justice he never got a fair trial
6911454 there is no doubt that as leader of the council mr grant has the blood of service cuts on his hands
6911455 but we all know that he is obeying his masters voice and we need to show the link between his actions as council leader and the decisions of alex salmond and the scottish government
6911456 burnt mounds dont usually consist of very much more than a hearth and a tank and a heap of burnt stones but in shetland we seem to have much more complex structures with little rooms or cells leading off from a main passageway which connects the hearth and tank
6911457 we have approximately 300 burnt mounds on shetland but only four or five have been excavated and of those the cruester mound is the most fascinating and complex it looks as if it has been in use for anything between 500 to 1 000 years
6911458 we think these cells may have originally been roofed over in a beehive shape
6911459 one theory is that these structures may have been used for cooking meat or tanning hides
6911460 but it is possible they could have raised steam by heating the water and that these little cells could have been used as saunas
6911461 the local group here came up with a novel idea for dealing with the problem
6911462 it is great to have had the chance to give new life to this particular site and make it accessible to future generations while also learning something new not just about cruester but about burnt mounds in general
6911463 this structure is important in world terms there are thousands of burnt mounds in britain ireland and scandinavia but only a handful are known to have structures within them
6911464 this exhibition will be a great asset for visitors to bressay and local people the more we understand about the past the better informed we are about the future
6911465 the bank of england needs to do something to prevent a fairly shallow recession from getting worse they need to cut interest rates this year
6911466 for years gordon brown boasted about consecutive quarters of economic growth now economic growth has ground to a halt and browns bubble has burst
6911467 were now seeing the full extent of the self delusion which led ministers to believe that everything was well with the british economy
6911468 the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high commodity prices as well as the uncertainty in the credit markets
6911469 the governments priority is to guide britain through these challenging times while also supporting those hit hardest as a result of these global factors
6911470 the implications for unemployment and the public finances are grim
6911471 there has never been a better time for them to buy
6911472 a lot of us have ideas about what we s advertisement hould be doing with kids and literacy or adults and literacy
6911473 the ideas are out there its just that they dont always get flagged up its maybe not new ideas we need its just a sense of putting ideas into practice
6911474 if it were to become partisan weve all decided that would be the end of the commission
6911475 when we announced our decision to leave our current television series after seven years we were very touched by the number of people friends family guests viewers and broadcasters who told us how much they wanted to see us continuing making programmes together
6911476 its a desperate move for people who are already washed up
6911477 the fact of the matter is that it indicates their career is over its not a smart move they were in a safe place and they are not going to enjoy the same traction as they did at channel 4 the fact is uktv needed them they will take an audience with them but i dont think its enough for them
6911478 when richard and judy moved from itv to channel 4 people said that this was the beginning of the end that they were stepping into oblivion instead they took their audience with them and built up a stronger one the same point applies today digital channels are the future not terrestrial they are both smart financially savvy people and i think its a clever move
6911479 go on roads that are a challenge to drive at normal speed
6911480 people think chace is gay and thought i was gay that we were humping its not true but hilarious people project their fantasies onto people ive never been someone who makes it my objective to go out and pick up chicks but ive met some fantastic ladies here you know those amazing conversations where you find yourself in a caf talking until 2 a m and never see them again
6911481 there are perks to this job we the gossip girl cast were all thrown into this situation with a lot of attention on us and you get a lot of free clothes and shit but thats no reason not to stay grounded what am i really doing baby saving the world nah im on television
6911482 chuck is an iconic character and the clothes are iconic i think i rock the look well my style has always been good top notch baby i like the glamorous indie rock look like the libertines but you know without the heroin needle sticking out of my arm
6911483 if i want to go out and drink and throw a glass in the street ill do it as long as the reason is that i want to have fun and not that i want to create some sort of tension around me then id be a dick but im not
6911484 i love going out in the summer the girls wear their nice dresses did that sound sleazy it really did didnt it put it like this everyone comes out looking gorgeous in summer we are a more beautiful species in the summer no doubt chuck bass would say cheers to that baby
6911485 many of the people whom i have spoken to feel some sense of confusion over what has happened they ask the question how could something that feels so right be so wrong the short answer is that we all got played like suckers by a seemingly premeditated and well acted charade the reason that so many of the young adults feel so torn over this is that we have taken on what some label as a ttherapeutic faith that is a faith in which feelings rule over facts in which the heart beats the head a faith that is built only upon feelings can truck along nicely until the rough weather comes along and this whole scandal is rough weather our culture values pleasure and feelings over almost everything else we need faiths in which our hearts and our heads work in tandem a faith that is only heart driven has no discernment the word warned of false prophets we must take everything we feel and experience back to scripture to be weighed
6911486 as we examine the mike guglielmucci scandal we can see the all of these elements coming together it is a tragic situation which has hurt thousands however some good can come of this my prayer for young leaders and for young believers is that a new style of leadership emerges one that rejects the traps of our culture one that shuns the glittering lights of hyperreality and instead lives for a mustard seed revolution in which the first victories are private the ones that we win in our own lives in our families lives and in our neighbourhoods

6911497 the only big problem for us has been the weather
6911498 our figures are roughly in line with last year which is a huge relief im not sure the problems with the box office affected us but the weather has we usually get a good walk up and wed have expected to do better
6911499 toby gough and i have just been relieved weve not been staging our outdoor shows at the botanics this year as weve done previously we reckon wed have had to cancel loads of shows due to bad weather and it could well have bankrupted us as it turns out weve had an excellent festival even though there are definitely less americans around weve had fantastic reviews and the people of edinburgh have come out in force
6911500 many scottish artists will benefit from additional support and funding through the made in scotland programme
6911501 the fund will allow artists to take greater creative risks or stage more ambitious projects at the fringe support and advice will enable companies to make sure they can take full advantage of performing at the worlds largest artistic showcase
6911502 the moving of the film festival to june was a huge success despite the initial doubts many people had the big question is which other festivals could safely move dates
6911503 with successful shows they quickly sell out and it becomes impossible to get in it would be great to see more shows like black watch brought back and their success spill over to the rest of the country
6911504 im not saying it is the only way but one of the ways of promoting the fringe is through the edinburgh comedy festival
6911505 the big thing we need to improve is to market the fringe properly to the rest of scotland and the uk as the awareness of the festival is just so poor at the moment we desperately need to look at transport infrastructure its just bonkers we cant run trains through the night to glasgow perth and dundee
6911506 were on the verge of recruiting a head of marketing and a marketing manager
6911507 i hope they can be persuaded to come back and play the same game as everyone else
6911508 the festival nearly suffered a major catastrophe the problem has been a wake up call and we look forward to working with the fringe to make sure this great event not only survives but thrives
6911509 the via box office system weve been using has been built specifically for this environment and is the only viable system for the fringe
6911510 the two big factors for me have been the pound dollar exchange rate and the weather i know at least 12 theatre producers from the us who just didnt come to the fringe this year because of the high costs due to the exchange rate and weve really been affected by the cost of everything
6911511 we intend to push forward to gaza in the face of any illeg advertisement itimate or belligerent demands to stop
6911512 we believe we have a moral and a legal right to go to gaza
6911513 if we are stopped or seized we intend to pursue legal action against israel for violating our rights
6911514 the israelis have cannon machine guns warships helicopters and jets all we have are hearing aids and biodegradable balloons for palestinian children
6911515 we have both dealt with the israelis before they can be a bit rough but they wont kill us
6911516 but gaza is so much worse its a big open air prison thats under siege were going to try to give hope to the gazan people the israelis claim the occupation is over but thats utter lies
6911517 these boats should be loaded with diplomats from around the world wanting to pursue the rights they supposedly represent
6911518 israel cant say we no longer occupy gaza but at the same time control its borders
6911519 your offer also slights our human rights mission which is to break the siege of gaza where israel collectively punishes 1 5 million palestinians
6911520 tough on seagulls and tough on the causes of seagulls
6911521 seagulls are a menace to scottish towns and cities they thrive on litter and their aggressive behaviour towards other birds pets and even people is increasingly problematic dumfries has a particular problem with gulls with regular reports of divebombing
6911522 i even read this week about a young paperboy who has had to abandon his deliveries due to constant attacks from the birds
6911523 you find these gulls making territorial noises in the middle of the night
6911524 some people are not concerned about it other people might be experiencing bad health effects from it so i think theres a legitimate cause to control gulls in certain circumstances under the terms of the law
6911525 its a long convoy there must be more than 40 vehicles
6911526 it was not clear one could say with any certainty that a substantial withdrawal was taking place
6911527 these results reflect the purposeful learning environment that is part of the ethos in an independent school encouraging pupils of all abilities to progress without disruption and to aspire to succeed
6911528 the reward for their hard work will be in achieving their ambition to go to university college or employment and hopefully obtain a passport to a secure career for the rest of their lives
6911529 i am delighted with the higher examination results not only because of the pass rate of 95 2 per cent but more importantly because of the quality of the passes
6911530 to achieve 61 4 per cent grade a passes with one third of candidates being awarded five as or more is outstanding and the highest percentage in the schools history
6911531 i have high expectations of my pupils and they have fulfilled these expectations and more
6911532 they clearly reflect the hard work that the girls have put into their studies
6911533 craigholme has a fine history and we aim to ensure that our pupils receive a balanced education that not only prepares them for univer sity life and their future careers but also develops happy well rounded young women
6911534 we are still working on a description of the car and we are following up cctv footage which will hopefully yield clues
6911535 people should not enter a vehicle if they are suspicious about its legitimacy
6911536 a terrifying ordeal for the victim who is understandably traumatised by what has happened
6911537 we would like to speak anyone who was in the area of the hudson hotel in hope street and saw the victim get into a car with the driver at around 2 15am or who saw her being pulled out of a car in brunstane road south in the early hours of sunday morning
6911538 its not hard for people to screw off a plate and attach it to another car if people see a plate they assume its legitimate

6911543 monarchs of such countries as spain and japan failed to make the cut
6911544 seventy six civilians most of them women and children were martyred today in a coalition forces operation in herat province
6911545 insurgents engaged the soldiers from multiple points within the compound using small arms and rpg rocket propelled grenade fire
6911546 the joint forces responded with small arms fire and an air strike killing 30 militants
6911547 around 2am people were attending a holy koran recitation when americans started bombing tens of civilians were killed
6911548 more than 30 people have been killed i cannot say how many of them are civilians
6911549 twenty five taleban were killed including sidiq and one other commander

6911555 i deduce that it was some combination of the factors mentioned which affected adversely the pilots ability to attend fully to all the matters requiring his attention during the last part and in particular the last two minutes of the flight
6911556 his descent below 1 540ft and then below 1 340 ft and his failure to grasp the urgency of the situation sufficiently to rectify it fully were due most probably to a combination of tiredness stress and an excessive workload
6911557 we will be studying closely the recommendations of the sheriffs report and will be responding fully in due course
6911558 television needs regulators just as roads need traffic wardens but you wouldnt ask your traffic warden to give you advice on what sort of car to buy still less how to drive it
6911559 the 14 million people who tuned into the final of britains got talent werent there to be entertained but to watch tv promote understanding of religions culture and lifestyles
6911560 i worry that weve lost sight of what makes programmes worth watching in the first place creativity imagination invention
6911561 television is there to delight to surprise and to inspire above all to enjoy its not a branch of the education service
6911562 the deathless language of the committee each word carefully weighed balanced and rinsed of all life and passion
6911563 we are pleased that cosla has approached us to reopen talks on this years pay award following the successful strike by members of the three unions on wednesday
6911564 obviously we want a solution to this dispute so we hope that discussions around a new offer more acceptable to our members can start quickly
6911565 members made it very clear on wednesday that they want a settlement that protects them from inflation and does not lock them in to multi year awards
6911566 the talks are welcome but are not in themselves a solution we will be talking to our fellow unions to agree future action should it be required and will announce this later

6911570 our research showed that for most students weekly living expenses can be upwards of 200 or more
6911571 its important for students to not only set a budget and stick to it but also to minimise the cost of any borrowing
6911572 this may include keeping the cost of their overdraft to a minimum by selecting a bank account with a zero per cent overdraft offer

6911760 one of the best ways to gather evidence that will potentially have some impact in court is to conduct surveillance of the franchise
6911761 if the case goes to court the franchisor can always use subpoenas to gather all the evidence of which surveillance will provide but a snapshot
6911762 there are quite a few former federal agents who now make a living as private investigators and they certainly are the best at obtaining good results
6911763 this will put the franchisee on his guard possibly preventing the franchisor from getting the evidence it needs to confirm its suspicions
6911764 mr haff notes that surveillance also may adversely affect franchisee morale and trust of the franchisor if the basis for terminating an underreporting franchisee is breach of trust hasnt the franchisor breached the trust of an innocent franchisee by putting him under surveillance
6911765 but it was horns opinion that that was an unacceptable position for a franchisor to take
6911766 investigators are fairly ingenious at figuring out ways to get the job done
6911767 some are known to use small video cameras that can fit inside a briefcase and investigator posing as a customer can shoot footage while waiting in line or sitting at a table an investigator can pose as a potential buyer if the franchisee has the business on the market
6911768 everyone knows which franchisee just built a beach house and which one drives a late model mercedes benz
6911769 the franchisee who is happy and wants to expand should be asked has anyone checked to see how much he claims to earn from the business if his p amp ls look so bad that you would expect him to be begging to get out of the system you have probably discovered another underreporter
6911770 a franchisee who feels the system has not worked for him may decide to use a little self help by underreporting sales
6911771 investigations of underreporting cases and transfer matters meaning transfers to other franchisees
6911772 in a manner which is unfair and deceptive to coerce unwarranted financial concessions from franchisees
6911773 regaled the assembled attorneys with photographs not of dunkin stores not of dunkin franchisee deliveries not of surveillance inside stores rather horn showed photographs of the personal homes boats and cars of dunkin franchisees
6911774 he then made explicit to the attorneys what he meant by
6911775 none asked about the ethics of dunkins strategy when this author paul steinberg asked if dunkins practices did not amount to extortion horn hastily said that he had been misunderstood some while later this author had communication with three attorneys about horns presentation two of the attorneys had attended the meeting one of those who attended noted that his clients had told him about the dunkin surveillance but that he was surprised that dunkin was so public about discussing such practices as well as surprised at the lack of reaction from the attendees
6911776 one attorney who had not attended the presentation defended the dunkin practice and said it was ethically permissible
6911777 he knows precisely what he is doing why he is doing it and he knows what the response of the other party will be its not even a close call in my mind its shocking to get up and boast it makes you wonder what else theyre up to
6911778 if he saw a franchisee driving a fancy car who owns a dunkin shop he felt that the franchisee wasnt working hard enough or he was stealing
6911779 franchisees that know horn know he would never think or say such a thing knowing his strong moral and ethical character this is pretty shocking news to us
6911780 unless you have some kind of foolproof documentation that steve horn made this statement ive told you what our next steps will be with all due respect i just hope you have your ducks in a row if this is the way you are going because we will be prepared to refute and get engaged in short order

6911782 oregonians deserve to know what al gore and the congress have in store for them

6911784 it appears that since the widget competition is heating up so much that the widget companies are throwing together scripts without testing these scripts on large scale networks they are just throwing crap together to try to out perform each other
6911785 such and such script was causing problems on such and such networks and we asked on this date that it be fixed and followed up on this date and spence didnt fix it so hes banned till he fixes it right now they are hiding behind a policy but no information

6911788 franchisee lifestyle everyone knows which franchisee just built a beach house and which one drives a late model mercedes
6911789 the franchisee who is happy and wants to expand has anyone checked to see how much he claims to earn from the business of course poor attitude may also bespeak a problem
6911790 he knows precisely what he is doing why he is doing it and he knows what the response of the other party will be its not even a close call in my mind its shocking to get up and boast it makes you wonder what else theyre up to

6911797 it appears that since the widget competition is heating up so much that the widget companies are throwing together scripts without testing these scripts on large scale networks they are just throwing crap together to try to out perform each other
6911798 such and such script was causing problems on such and such networks and we asked on this date that it be fixed and followed up on this date and spence didnt fix it so hes banned till he fixes it right now they are hiding behind a policy but no information

6911809 recently i was talking with a greek friend and he was telling me that a good portion of the curriculum in his grade school and middle school back in greece was dedicated to cultural things such as learning folk dances traditional songs historical legends and things of this nature
6911810 therefore i am calling for all missouri public schools to teach their students to dance the missouri waltz it is our state song after all it has a history here in missouri wouldnt it be nice to hear it played at a wedding reception and see all the native sons and daughters of missouri come out and dance to their state song i know we try to instill as much learning as we can in our kids during those hours at school but adding a little culture to the mix couldnt hurt
6911811 we are interviewing people in south florida and we should close this out fairly quickly it did not come from tallahassee
6911812 we have excellent leads and we should close this out very quickly
6911813 i was expecting to see somewhere around 200 in savings
6911814 i wasnt expecting a lot but i was expecting some savings
6911815 amendment 10s 3 percent increase on assessed values eats up most of the savings from amendment 1
6911816 but thats the rule of amendment 10 no one ever thought wed have reductions in values
6911817 in the aftermath of storms it is important to ensure the safety and security of our vulnerable citizens
6911818 we checked the facilities and everything is operational problems during the storm were minimal and there were no power failures
6911819 generally speaking were looking after the well being of residents
6911820 in collier county i think they are having a few problems because they were hit with a stronger storm here everything is up and running 100 percent
6911821 you get more from those patients than you can ever give
6911822 were looking for compassionate nonjudgmental people who are willing to give of their time
6911823 it was a big hit last year when it started
6911824 so i gambled on going further afield so i flew to sydney and then to bali and then to jakarta and called on my stepfathers ex business partner major timmy sastrosatomo and he set me up as a silversmith batik dabber in a house once owned by the princes of mataran and he told me all his troubles
6911825 the bulldozers came and turned us into whole fruit fruit bar sticks and china markers
6911826 i enjoyed every minute of the job its been a growing experience and very rewarding ive learned a lot about the town and something about myself
6911827 its really time for me to let go and give my two newest colleagues time to grow and operate at their fullest potential its time for some new ideas new blood and perhaps a new direction
6911828 the funds from the sale of the carnegie library can be used for a senior center i hope that comes to pass wherever the location is
6911829 im really upset i really enjoy working with him hes done an excellent job
6911830 im sorry to hear that he will not be coming back hes really someone who does what he believes in is a really hard worker and has been extremely active the towns made great progress over the past two years and his efforts are a big part of that i wish hed reconsider because i think the town has been so lucky to have him
6911831 i am just really really busy working on fall town meeting stuff we have our hands full and thats what im focused on
6911832 i wish him well in the future and think its a good decision
6911833 i think heinze and i are both functioning fully were not running around town hall all the time like he is but were certainly capable and have worked at higher levels than this
6911834 for me to invest the kind of time in my profession and continue to invest the amount of time i should in the town i would really have very little time left for my wife and family i dont want to shortchange the town
6911835 i am shocked to hear the news that mr aparo will not be seeking re election
6911836 while i had the time of my life during the election campaign this past spring i have no plans to run again i am fully occupied in leading a fine group of people in the endeavor of preparing an open space and recreation plan for rockport
6911837 fighting the good fight accountability and being professional thats the legacy i want to be remembered
6911838 are you booing because you dont like kaiser chiefs in a mick take way make your minds up
6911839 this is only our third gig so we thank you very much
6911840 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
6911841 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman were going to try to go dark to the extent that the character allows it
6911842 if you want to elect a person who is hardworking organized and has extensive courtroom and legal experience one who has the maturity wisdom and knowledge from 53 years of life experiences and who has the patience to listen to both sides of the argument examine all the evidence treat all parties with respect follow the law and render a fair and impartial decision then i ask you to vote for me
6911843 i present myself to the electorate as a lifelong public servant whose only ambition is to make the legal system more accessible and welcoming to all
6911844 i have the most diverse and well rounded legal background of the three candidates having practiced law in the type of matters that retiring judge barbara gurrolas docket includes
6911845 i want to continue to dedicate my lifetime of experience to your public service
6911846 i am a good listener a judge needs to listen to litigants and the arguments involved i will remain objective and impartial and i will balance the interest of the victims and the accused
6911847 i think the best way to describe how its going is its established
6911848 it was brand new to us im not sure we had real clear expectations
6911849 it protects a fathers rights by giving them a proactive way to say to officialdom if you will if a child i may have conceived becomes a part of an adoption proceeding then i want the opportunity to have a say so in that proceeding
6911850 the registry is going to be most effective when it becomes common knowledge
6911851 i kissed a girl was inspired when i opened up a magazine and i saw a picture of
6911852 i was with my boyfriend at the time and i said to him i m not going to lie if
6911853 well ive actually been approved by the government to play a show
6911854 ive already sold 10 000 tickets there so i will be going to put on a concert for the fans they tend to you know sometimes not want western artists in their country i respect that but at the same time you know theres people that listen to music there and want to see their idols and stuff so its all good been approved by the government and im going to go put on a show and have fun
6911855 for me i just had probably the best game of my career we got in late and i was kind of tired today but a lot of guys say when youre tired you have your best days
6911856 we got beat up today what are you going to do
6911857 they came out swinging the bats they hit the ball all over the park and out of it
6911858 you know its good to hit a grand slam but i would rather it have been against somebody else
6911859 because neal and i go way back i consider him a friend i have to do my job too but if i could choose someone else i would
6911860 i walked the first guy and put us in a bigger jam than we were already in i put one over the plate and he harris put a good swing on it
6911861 he looks pretty good over there today he swung the bat well
6911862 i know im strong enough to hit the ball out of the park but im not up there trying to hit the ball out of the park
6911863 i dont know where its coming from and im not trying to figure it out
6911864 has a real curiosity about the world who loves life and can find passion in lifes smallest moments
6911865 when you look at hockey on the tv its always the red wings or pittsburgh playing
6911866 youre always going to pay attention because its attractive hockey its a lot of offense and a lot of great players i want to play that way i liked playing like that in pittsburgh and
6911867 i was pleased at first to hear that the producers were trying to make christianity accessible to people who might not usually watch religious programming
6911868 im starting to think i would prefer spending my sunday nights being bashed repeatedly in the face with a large leather bound king james version
6911869 the program says little about relationship and a great deal about regulation
6911870 while there is a slim chance it may promote conversation by and large my view is that it is damaging to the gospel
6911871 we were encouraged to take part on the understanding that we were dealing with a group of people who genuinely wanted to embrace christianity
6911872 in doing this they have edited a warped view of evangelical christianity
6911873 there seems to be very little mention of jesus and little mention of love
6911874 these results prove that most americans want to be fair to gay people
6911875 our aspiration is to always see each other as individuals first and though we may not always succeed at that our underlying fairness and decency means that one day soon we will this marks tremendous progress for our community and for the voting public
6911876 why should it be this is a problem that is a fijian problem
6911877 it is all the fijian political parties all the registered political parties will participate and discuss the electoral reform that has been suggested
6911878 are we going to be bullied and pressured into doing things that are clearly not in our national interest
6911879 mccain staffers reported that they had received an envelope containing white powder in mccains campaign office in centennial
6911880 the staff has been quarantined and the building has been evacuated
6911881 i want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
6911882 this is his decision and i expect him to make it however he feels is best
6911883 obviously doesnt have a very clear sense of what ordinary americans are going through
6911884 maybe mccain thinks this economy is working for folks like him but how are things going for you
6911885 there is no best host there is only the host thats best for you
6911886 weve had great success with enterprise repeats on monday night and theres an appetite for space opera as battlestar goes away
6911887 theres an opportunity to keep the space opera as part of our programming strategy
6911888 this is an opportunity to reinvent this franchise and make it relevant to a new generation
6911889 we really dont want to be more of the same its going to build clearly off the existing franchise but with a cast that gives it a younger vibe
6911890 in universe we plan to keep those elements that have made the franchise a success such as adventure and humor while breaking new ground in the relationships between mostly young and desperate explorers thrust together and far from home above all we believe the stargate itself remains an enduring icon with infinite potential as a jumping off point for telling stories
6911891 the us dollar weakened significantly against other major currencies in 2007 and according to some economists is expected to depreciate further in 2008
6911892 as a consequence other currencies particularly the euro are poised to weaken the us dollars dominance as the currency of choice for international remittances and payments
6911893 this trend could also drive an increase in observed instances of bulk cash transfers denominated in currencies other than canadian and us dollars
6911894 the illicit drug market remains the largest criminal market in terms of extent scope and the degree of involvement by the majority of organized crime groups
6911895 due to their relative abundance isolation and the large number of logging access roads
6911896 i just dont understand the enforcement how this can be logical how it can be realistic for the state of iowa
6911897 i hope they listen very carefully because i tell you theres a lot of important issues here i think one of the big issues we have now is with the bars and restaurants
6911898 but this is cash money its a small boutique group of artists with a very similar fan base
6911899 theres a core group of consumers that associate with the specific cash money brand
6911900 more time should be given to guarantee that all the bidders can provide the air force with the best options possible
6911901 given the delays already caused by the air forces own flawed selection process the request for additional time to prepare a proposal based on a different aircraft is entirely reasonable and it should be granted
6911902 these planes will be in the fleet for 40 to 60 years and its more important to make the right decision
6911903 this is a 40 billion contract to design and build the backbone of our nations military might and the requirements have changed overnight
6911904 providing only 60 days for a major design overhaul not only skews the competition toward airbus but also breaks the promise of a fair competition for our military and taxpayers
6911905 love and friendship are profoundly personal selfish values love is an expression and assertion of self esteem a response to ones own values in the person of another one gains a profoundly personal selfish joy from the mere existence of the person one loves it is ones own personal selfish happiness that one seeks earns and derives from love
6911906 this is the opportunity you cant do it when youre running around the tan running track in the middle of winter in melbourne you can do it when you get an opportunity to play cricket being across in india is the right place to do it
6911907 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross
6911908 to make good on a promise to match democrats dollar for dollar this year blaming his gop colleagues for not chipping in
6911909 i recently challenged my colleagues to step up to the plate and help me provide the resources our candidates need to compete in races across the country to match the dscc expenditures in targeted races
6911910 it has become clear that my call has gone largely unanswered i have no control over the timing or content of independent expenditure ads but i have had no choice but to decrease the total budget of our ie unit it is still my hope that my republican colleagues will engage in this election and help match what the democrats are doing if they do i will adjust our budget accordingly
6911911 mamma mia when nobody is watching did i actually type that last part ouch
6911912 battlestar galactica marathon or maybe thats just me even the dalai lama is said to have a passion for expensive watches
6911913 thats where i get my news except of course for the mercury news
6911914 how did you know my one problem with junk food is cheez its
6911915 my mother loved them and i have to stay away from them im not tempted by chocolates or anything sweet but i have to watch out
6911916 my brother and i used to watch all the shows and we had all the action figures growing up we used to dress up like the wrestlers for halloween so its something that weve always enjoyed watching
6911917 my guilty pleasure is ebay the most comprehensive museum ever imagined
6911918 i try to find at least one item there for each show just check out the 1960s rolodex file in our production of doubt center stage on sister aloysius desk i love the idea that the perfect detail is actually available somewhere and i can search the entire country to find it
6911919 on the weekend i like to let my hair down what little i have left of it
6911920 and just be a regular guy blend in with the crowd im a relaxed rider where you put your leather jacket on and sit back its definitely freedom you feel like its just you and the elements its refreshing
6911921 thats a secret pleasure for me i dont even know exactly why i like it so much except that is has dench and she could gargle and id love it
6911922 my foodie friends would not be pleased but whenever i need a little lift maybe every three months or so i eat an entire tub of frozen cool whip its soothing its cold and i love it
6911923 if i can hit the gym between 12 and 1 my guilty pleasure is to reward myself for sweating by watching the e news and then the daily ten on the e channel at least i can honestly say ive never watched it just sitting down
6911924 ill eat anything kraft macaroni amp cheese im old school i like the kind with the powder i also like liverwurst or fried bologna sandwiches because my dad used to make them hes german but honestly i am surrounded by the other stuff at work so when i get home i like to keep it simple
6911925 no not the unwanted messages you get in your e mail the spam luncheon meat that comes in the rectangular blue can i grew up eating it spam and eggs spam and rice spam musubi with sushi rice wrapped in seaweed i prefer not to create anything too complicated like the spam sandwiches suggested on its container id rather have pure unadulterated spam next time youre feeling a bit under the weather try this spam with macaroni peas and chicken broth yum
6911926 i love horror films not just because i crave the goose bump factor of a good evisceration but also because horror is one of the most metaphorically rich genres of the postmodern age
6911927 horror is an allegory for existence teeth takes a bite out of sexism in society the last winter fast forwards to the rising tide of global warming even the granddaddy of modern monster movies jaws indicts the pettiness of business interests determined to keep the beaches open no matter whats in the water horror intimately reflects who we are what we want and what scares the capri pants off us from hamlet to hostel horror is as fundamental to human existence as comedy and tragedy its like beckett only with disemboweling whats not to love
6911928 how on earth will six girls going to fit on that stage
6911929 because he gets really hungry and needs lots of arms to help him get food
6911930 researchers have found a correlation between drinking diet soda and metabolic syndrome the collection of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes that include abdominal obesity high cholesterol and blood glucose levels and elevated blood pressure
6911931 with four vma commercials an accompanying promotional photoshoot featuring host russell brand and three nominations for
6911932 britney is so excited to attend the vma show but as of now there will be no performance
6911933 right now britney is focusing on her kids and recording
6911934 how on earth will six girls going to fit on that stage
6911935 the shutters in the shops are half down now its not the open season it was over the last six weeks
6911936 i t doesnt look like the quality players i wanted are going to be the ones ill be chasing we just need to get numbers in its probably out of reach to bring in the six or seven we need now theres a possibility we might end up bringing no one in
6911937 we couldnt cope until january with what we have right now we have to make sure that the season isnt over before it has started so we need to get on with things we knew on may 14 that we needed to bring players in we had 15 professionals and five of those had serious injuries im the manager and i take full responsibility for that
6911938 i have never trained with robinho but i like him because his style is different
6911939 he tries to dribble many times he is a different player and we need one player on the pitch who makes a difference we have one team that we play one system and to change this system we need different players if we have one system only its easier for the other teams
6911940 i want to leave and i want to play in the premier league
6911941 i hope the directors reach an agreement with chelsea to resolve my situation as quickly as possible
6911942 we had no training on thursday and i received information that sheva was in milan because he had negotiations but he trained as normal yesterday
6911943 i dont ask what happened because its not my business my business is training i put sheva with di santo in training against john terry and ricardo carvalho because wigan will play against us with two strikers
6911944 if i lose one or two its not a problem for me because i have minimum 24 or 25
6911945 i have three or four players in this position right wing left wing if the club sell one or two players more its not a problem for me
6911946 i said to frank i know why you are sad because now you renew your chelsea contract and you have money you need to think about how to spend it
6911947 frank laughed he knows very well his position at chelsea
6911948 the christian community might one day be in a position to consider the pleas of homosexual believers that have formed families and seek inclusion into the community of those whose permanent covenanted relationships receive the churchs recognition and support this kind of church might have the capacity to reflect on the idea that even though gods design for sexuality in creation was heterosexual in our fallen world a tiny minority among us is mysteriously just not wired that way and needs some structure in which their relationships and families can be properly formed and sustained if they are not called to the celibate path
6911949 rethink our response to homosexuals themselves for some this will mean dropping a harsh posture getting the facts on the challenges faced by those in the homosexual community and opening our hearts of compassion for others it will mean a renewed commitment to the whole counsel of god on human sexuality
6911950 completes a pattern of hyped one sided reportage that goes back a while
6911951 completes a pattern of hyped one sided reportage that goes back a while
6911952 we have had lots of debate over the best position for gerrard over the last couple of years but we know the quality he can produce no matter where he plays
6911953 as a manager you have to think what is best for the team he gives us different options in the wide areas but he likes to play in the middle its different when you manage a national team or a club you have many good players with an international team but at a club you are selecting the players you want for your system and ideas so sometimes it is easier i will not criticise the national managers because you have to respect them
6911954 but its important for us to know that gerrard has the right mentality for us england have other options he knows the other options ferdinand and john terry and that they are good players too
6911955 it was positive we needed to talk and clarify the situation for the future of the club all the problems have been resolved so we are now progressing and trying to improve the squad there is no problem its clear that we were working together and we are working together again
6911956 he has said to us if you need me to resign from this football club because it will serve the needs of the premier league im fine with that he is embarrassed about the indignity he has brought upon his football club and the premier league he never intended this to be the case three months ago it was very different
6911957 we are looking at taking him off the board as a director
6911958 but can he be a shareholder those are two very different issues the jurisdiction around the term fit and proper person needs to be more clearly defined it is a very loose term almost tongue in cheek because there have been plenty of unfit and improper people in the league over the last 10 years
6911959 the one thing he is adamant about is that he is not going to sell his majority or bring in institutes
6911960 were talking about friends of friends it should all be resolved before the end of the transfer window these are very wealthy friends
6911961 he wants to be at this ground on sunday but he is hearing advice from many people about being in a public space
6911962 there has been a threat to his safety worldwide and he has to be conscious of that but i think one of the safest places for him to be right now would be this stadium
6911963 this is something we are talking to wayne about and he himself has started to identify that its a weakness it is not a bad thing for him to have come out after englands 2 2 draw against the czech republic and said so he is realising he needs to be more around the edge of the box in the last third of play it can be a waste of energy chasing from man to man to man but thats his natural enthusiasm and you cant fault that
6911964 eleven days under pressure we are working at something but you never know in football we may get him we may not were trying but if we dont we will carry on with what we have got if you take the long term view i think we would be ok
6911965 unselfishness is not the biggest crime to have in your life as a footballer
6911966 it shows qualities of team ethic and that is terrific to see in this era of need to be seen just look how some players celebrate goals the earrings they wear and the tattoos they have it tells you the age we are in it is refreshing that someone is prepared to sacrifice for the team effort its only a small correction he has to make
6911967 theres been no progress on james milners situation yet but were having a meeting on wednesday about a lot of things and it will be discussed
6911968 i would have thought well also discuss michael and stevie harper too but i cant see any reason why we cant secure all three players
6911969 ill know where everything is when i sit down with them on wednesday
6911970 im not completely in the loop but i know a lot of what has gone and i know that after wednesday well have a better idea of where we are ive not been party to all these contract talks but although ive not been in the room when theyve been going on ive been kept informed
6911971 i think if it gets to january then the chances are michael wont be signing but i dont think it will go to january
6911972 in my opinion michael is the best at what he does in his position and i think michael knows hes the best its up to fabio capello but if michaels fit to play for newcastle hell be fit to play for england we wont be pulling him out of the national squad
6911973 im looking for three new players to come in a defender a midfielder and a striker and i certainly dont want to lose anybody
6911974 he has been given a clean bill of health and has told us he will return to work tomorrow when he will travel to london to be at the tottenham v sunderland match
6911975 borja can link up the play from back to front and he will enhance the excellent midfield options we already possess
6911976 he understands the ambition of the club he understands where we want to take the club
6911977 hes actually hanging out at my house for a couple of days right now i got the last diaper before bedtime tonight
6911978 my oldest daughters due date was yesterday and still no grandson
6911979 my wife and i have an overnight bag in the trunk of the car and my cell phone is never far from me
6911980 can we be as big or bigger than manchester united yes can we win the premier league yes can we win the champions league it will take time probably 10 years or more but if i didnt think that i wouldnt be here
6911981 the truth is that this club is not going out of business it is not bankrupt and we currently have good offers in for four players i know whats ahead and i know thaksins ambitions he still wants to buy the ronaldinhos of this world and he knows he can do that only if he has an abundant amount of cash
6911982 do we have 40m in the bank to buy new players no
6911983 we have five or six different options and we want to get it done in the transfer window because we need three or four players
6911984 as he resolves his issues in thailand the anticipation is that he will get some of his money back
6911985 all i know is that he has some very wealthy friends
6911986 embarrassed about the indignities he has brought on the club
6911987 it is a very loose term almost tongue in cheek because there have been plenty of unfit and improper people in the league over the last 10 years
6911988 greed and jealousy i wont use the word corruption but wherever theres greed and jealousy there will be something else that follows it
6911989 hes embroiled in a political process and ive chosen to stay out of it is he a nice guy yes is he a great guy to play golf with yes does he have plenty of money to run a football club yes i really care only about those three things whether he thaksin is guilty of something over in thailand i cant worry i have to be conscious of it but my role is to run a football club i worked for nike who were accused of child labour issues and i managed to have a career there for 15 years i believed we were innocent of most of the issues morally i felt comfortable in that environment its the same here
6911990 ive talked about this a lot to mark and he sort of understands china and india 30 of the world population need a league to watch and we want manchester city to be their club to do that we need a superstar because no disrespect richard dunne doesnt roll off the tongue in beijing
6911991 when we talked to mark about coming to this club we said dont come if you dont think you need a superstar he said he wanted to challenge himself by managing the best players
6911992 mark is adamant he wants premier league experience because that is what let us down last season marks a homegrown lad very old school hed rather sign players he knows even overpay thats an endearing piece of what hes all about he doesnt like the unknown because it takes him out of his comfort zone he jumps out of his comfort zone when we say to him hey youve got to change this up a little bit but he cant have roque santa cruz so now hes back in his uncomfortable zone which is that he will have to bring in someone new and develop them
6911993 the dead of winter when the players are putting on gloves and tights there are five games in 10 days and its bloody tough
6911994 marks assessment was that he had seen the players he wanted to keep and the areas where he felt we could do better there were a couple of players we looked at selling because mark said he wanted to bring in better we went out to sign those players they didnt come and we were left holding the baby
6911995 everyones for sale if they want to stay at this club they will have to aspire to it
6911996 thaksin has said himself i probably made some mistakes last season he realises he needs to give the manager more room be more patient
6911997 if i were to ask him is it true we havent got any money hed fire me on the spot
6911998 there is one good thing about the free market system imbalances return to a balance although that process is usually not pretty and not everyone is happy about the way it happens returns will eventually properly reflect risk and determine the price value
6911999 apoyar un movimiento de creaci n contempor neo e innovador como es el graffiti que ha generado una nueva forma de ver arte paseando por las calles
6912000 es un punto muy importante para que el graffiti y la ciudad tengan un encuentro que puede generar trabajo y turismo as como revitalizar el parque
6912001 apoyo a las expresiones art sticas pero evitando la degradaci n de la ciudad
6912002 es muy importante la participaci n del rea de cultura en la toma de decisiones porque hay zonas muy sensibles
6912003 las tapias de los colegios o los parques pueden ser magn ficos sitios para pintar
6912004 m s que de buscar nuevos espacios se trata de legalizar los que ya est n en uso
6912005 en la ciudad residen algunos de los mejores graffiteros del pa s
6912006 but when the fulness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons
6912007 think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfil for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven for i say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven
6912008 least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
6912009 except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees
6912010 for laying aside the commandment of god ye hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things ye do
6912011 and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight
6912012 upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as god hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when i come
6912013 let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of an holyday or of the new moon or of the sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ
6912014 blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross
6912015 for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all
6912016 now therefore why tempt ye god to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear
6912017 for it seemed good to the holy ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things that ye abstain from meats offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves ye shall do well fare ye well
6912018 but now after that ye have known god or rather are known of god how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage ye observe days and months and times and years i am afraid of you lest i have bestowed upon you labour in vain
6912019 christians shall not judaize and be idle on saturday the sabbath but shall work on that day but the lords day sunday they shall especially honor and as being christians shall if possible do no work on that day if however they are found judaizing they shall be shut out from christ
6912020 the elevation of sunday as a public holiday and day of rest despite a manifest solar pagan background
6912021 there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god for he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as god did from his
6912022 wherefore also we keep the eighth day with joyfulness the day also on which jesus rose again from the dead
6912023 be not deceived with strange doctrines nor with old fables which are unprofitable for if we still live according to the jewish law we acknowledge that we have not received grace if therefore those who were brought up in the ancient order of things have come to the possession of a new hope no longer observing the sabbath but living in the observance of the lords day on which also our life has sprung up again by his death
6912024 and on the day called sunday all who live in cities or in the country gather together in one place and the memoirs of the apostles or writings of the prophets are read but sunday in the day on which we all hold a common assembly because it is the first day of the week on which god made the world and jesus christ our savior on the same day rose from the dead
6912025 on the day the first of the weak we assemble ourselves together
6912026 he in fulfillment of the precept according to the gospel keeps the lords day glorifying the lords resurrection in himself
6912027 we solemnize the day after saturday in contradiction to those who call this day their sabbath
6912028 the mystery of the lords resurrection may not be celebrated on any other day that the lords day and on this alone should we observe the breaking off of the paschal feast
6912029 one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every day alike let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind
6912030 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new
6912031 for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but a new creature
6912032 and he is before all things and by him all things consist
6912033 that the protestants were forbid to work on popish holy days even in harvest time under heavy penalties
6912034 and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six
6912035 christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law ye are fallen from grace
6912036 and if by grace then is it no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace but if it be of works then it is no more grace otherwise work is no more work
6912037 christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law ye are fallen from grace
6912038 know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth
6912039 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast
6912040 but not as the offence so also is the free gift for if through the offence of one many be dead much more the grace of god and the gift by grace which is by one man jesus christ hath abounded unto many
6912041 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely
6912042 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved
6912043 lift up your eyes to the heavens and look upon the earth beneath for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke and the earth shall wax old like a garment and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner but my salvation is forever and my righteousness shall not be abolished
6912044 this only would i learn of you receive ye the spirit by the works of the law or by hearing of the faith are you so foolish having begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh
6912045 every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning

6912051 illegal aliens generally do not want u s citizenship americans are very vain thinking that everybody in the world wants to be a u s citizen mexicans want to remain citizens of their home country while obtaining the benefits offered by the united states such as employment medical care in state tuition government subsidized housing and free education for their offspring their main attraction is employment and their loyalty usually remains at home they want benefits earned and subsidized by middle class americans what illegal aliens want are benefits of american residence without paying the price mexico is not a friend of the united states since 1848 mexicans have resented the united states during world war i mexico allowed german spies to operate freely in mexico to spy on the u s during world war ii mexico allowed the axis powers to spy on the u s from mexico during the cold war mexico allowed spies hostile to the u s to operate freely the attack on the twin towers in 2001 was cheered and applauded all across mexico today mexican school children are taught that the u s stole california arizona new mexico and texas if you dont believe it check out some mexican textbooks written for their schoolchildren
6912052 at this point im not sure i see a consensus for how the commission ends up addressing it
6912053 thats what i have worked for to get where i am now i am not where i want to be but i am where i need to be to move forward this is the next big test
6912054 a lot of the faces here are new but we have had a lot of success together
6912055 me and cash have been in a lot of conversations over the years this was definitely one of the better ones
6912056 no question if he pitches well and we win its a great story for everyone
6912057 thats the situation were in right now we need to find ways to win its good for him to be back to be healthy and hopefully he pitches well for us
6912058 hopefully there are no more setbacks hopefully he goes out there and helps us to win
6912059 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6912060 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6912061 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6912062 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6912063 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
6912064 its a lot more fun when youre not hitting out of the trees and chipping out sideways
6912065 i need to go out saturday and have a good day and shoot 6 or 7 under
6912066 i tried hard but struggled to focus this afternoon it really is a knockdown after the last couple of weeks
6912067 they were smooth they still held fairly well but you could tell that they are going to get firm
6912068 ive got two tournaments going on within one thats basically what i feel like
6912069 im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible i feel a little more pressure
6912070 youve got to drive the ball well and shape it both ways and make sure that your short game is in shape because its quite difficult around the greens
6912071 i had to hit every bit of a 3 iron in there
6912072 this is a great golf course this is one of the best courses weve played all year for sure
6912073 j t osullivan will be our starting quarterback going into the season and im expecting him to succeed
6912074 im very confident j t is at the point where hes our best man for the job right now
6912075 this hasnt been a case of alex and shaun not performing well
6912076 this has been a case of j t performing very well thats why we are where we are j t has very good command of the offense hes played well in all three preseason games and now its time for us to get ready for the regular season
6912077 for me i just had probably the best game of my career we got in late and i was kind of tired today but a lot of guys say when youre tired you have your best days
6912078 ive heard that so many times and its never really happened to me before until today it was just a good win for us we fought back the whole game
6912079 we got beat up today what are you going to do
6912080 they came out swinging the bats they hit the ball all over the park and out of it
6912081 you know its good to hit a grand slam but i would rather it have been against somebody else
6912082 because neal and i go way back i consider him a friend i have to do my job too but if i could choose someone else i would
6912083 i walked the first guy and put us in a bigger jam than we were already in i put one over the plate and he harris put a good swing on it
6912084 he looks pretty good over there today he swung the bat well
6912085 i know im strong enough to hit the ball out of the park but im not up there trying to hit the ball out of the park
6912086 i dont know where its coming from and im not trying to figure it out
6912087 estou sem palavras n o sei o que dizer gostaria que estivessem mais de n s aqui

6912089 the pole is huge for us this track obviously track position pit stall selection those things are really important
6912090 i had to pedal it pretty hard coming off of turn two because i got back to the gas pretty quick and it shoved the front end a little bit he said
6912091 all in all it ended up being a pretty good lap it gave us a good pit selection and good starting position
6912092 i just got a little free and i felt like i would have enough track to chase it and just didnt get out of the throttle he said
6912093 when you think about the six seven cars that are still battling that out eight cars maybe those eight cars are in a position where finishing 12th is way better than finishing 38th
6912094 you dont want to go out there and risk running out of fuel or anything but theres not a lot you can do here
6912095 a lot of the wrecks that you end up finding yourselves in here are because of something that happened two or three cars ahead of you
6912096 just getting caught up in something so long as i dont make any mistakes have lapses in judgment and we dont get caught up in something i think we should be pretty good
6912097 youve got to be sharp youve got to be on your game theres no time to take a breath around this place it is very very fast and thats what makes it fun and exciting
6912098 i think it creates excitement burton said and the chance that a driver whose team has done well all year could fade with a difficult three week run is all a part of it
6912099 ill be the first person to tell you things could go horribly wrong
6912100 at the same time i ask why would i just stay in my comfort zone ive always followed my musical instincts if it all works out badly that will be what happens it will be horrible and people will laugh and ill just have to figure out what to do after that

6912271 i dont know who is going to the convention from my caucus what i do know is that our number 1 priority is to solve the budget
6912272 i cant justify going when we dont have a budget
6912273 given the fact that the legislature is over two months past their constitutional deadline and our state faces a looming cash crisis most californians will probably be disappointed to hear that the assembly has chosen not to hold session for most of next week
6912274 i cant imagine anyone going so if anybody goes there and theyre not here then i think all hell will rain down upon them
6912275 we ought to be here and the public ought to be outraged if were anywhere but here
6912276 if we dont have official work that were supposed to be here doing here part of our job as democrats is to help elect our next president

6912281 its fun to go around baltimore seeing things that you may or may not know existed baltimore has hidden treasures everywhere and i think people will find new places during the race
6912282 if you think baltimore young people dont have access to all of the opportunities that they should then unchained talent is a good cause to support
6912283 i knew this was a school i wanted to attend
6912284 coming here will bring my game to the next level
6912285 over here everything is structured its unlike any other team ive been on my welcome to camp drill was running the full length of a football field 16 times with a 90 second pause in between
6912286 back home i played football and had a chance to relax with friends outside of the team
6912287 here at training camp youre with your team mates all the time
6912288 not that there is anything wrong with that my teammates are super friendly but i miss having a home cooked meal
6912289 when my coach first called me bubba i wasnt quite sure how to react
6912290 but they have showed me a lot of respect and its great to be here
6912291 theres only so much i could have done to prepare for the weather while i was home
6912292 its like nothing the weather we were having up until july but that just means i have to work harder that everyone else
6912293 ever since then ive known that something iron clad existed
6912294 i dont think ive ever put this into words to geoff but when something like that happens a corner is turned and you just dont see life in any other way except together
6912295 we never felt persecuted some people felt that they did but we didnt
6912296 we had a suburban domesticated life and we just took for granted that we had the right to do so as two guys living together
6912297 will not reset their memory of how they were summoned

6912299 we can confirm the deaths of four british nationals in a road traffic accident on august 20

6912306 we wanted to create a way where these kids who have very similar backgrounds to me use their creativity to inspire them to channel their energy and their talents into a different space that they might not have thought about before
6912307 can include taking pictures or taking notes the definition is very broad
6912308 its unclear who is actually in charge and whose rules apply to the information thats being collected and shared and distributed through these fusion centers
6912309 beyond normal law enforcement functions and start becoming intelligence collectors against protest groups the reports that we obtained make clear that there was no indication of any sort of criminal activity and yet that investigation went on for 14 months and these reports were uploaded into a federal database when all these agencies are authorized to go out and start collecting this information and putting it in areas where its accessible by the intelligence community its a very dangerous proposition for our democracy

6912311 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
6912312 there are four committees and how they relate to each other will come forward very shortly
6912313 this was a conviction obtained in the most appalling of circumstances my client feels it was an unfair trial and a travesty of justice we need to inquire whether this conviction should be recognised by this court
6912314 far far below what is acceptable in western european standards
6912315 the fact remains that mr gadd was aware what the police were intending to do at least three or four days ago mr gadds situation is clear mr gadd has been convicted of a relevant offence and the fact of that conviction cannot possibly be challenged
6912316 mr gadd has demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
6912317 he didnt seem to have any bags and was shouting at the taxi driver asking him where he was
6912318 it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety and these past few days have enabled the metropolitan police and i on his behalf to put into place a proper procedure for his protection and his wellbeing
6912319 they had their identities changed but here we have someone in the public eye and in terms of a new identity you cant really give him one i would have thought that the police will conclude that the measures they have to put in place will be minimal
6912320 there was a lot of comment about the compact pedestrian friendly central city but it was also an area people wanted improved the most
6912321 we can deal with the macro but we have to deal with the micro also
6912322 some saw value in the council being involved a couple of business representatives saw the most value in the council taking a less regulatory approach and not frustrating development
6912323 we just have to be ourselves if you build for the locals the tourists will come
6912324 to be in a decent spot and just have someone else ruin my race for me thats the disappointing thing
6912325 dont know what to think right now im just down on it all really its the olympic final and everyone is laying it on the line
6912326 everything is a bit of blur really im not sure what happened i was on my head im sure if that was a heat everyone would have simmered down a little bit and i would have exited that corner in third spot
6912327 i was third into that corner and just got smacked to the ground
6912328 i slid out on the first turn and just sort of sat there a few tears rolled down my face it happened so quick
6912329 im only 20 years old and this has been a big learning experience for me first games
6912330 we came up empty handed but we had a bit of bad luck
6912331 officials said the obama campaign had taken the trouble to print material bearing the names of several potential ticketmates thereby minimizing the significance of a report that a printing company in kansas was churning out signs bearing bayhs name
6912332 there will be a process to go through but i am now unemployed because india has fallen over
6912333 i have had a break in the last four years i have been in italy on sabbatical new zealand as the cricket high performance manager and india so im ready to be back in perth where the national hockey teams are based
6912334 with a bit of luck they could be playing in the main game its that close at this level
6912335 they didnt play as well as they could in the semi final but if you look at the team they were playing spain have some of the best strikers in the world with about 600 games of experience
6912336 and we lost schubert and our young strikers have about 60 games between them so they are inexperienced
6912337 they had an easy ride through and sometimes that doesnt prepare you for the toughness of whats ahead whereas both germany and spain struggled in their pool games but came through
6912338 i think this is the last opportunity for a number of these players to play together and it would be gut wrenching for them to come away with nothing dancer said
6912339 its gut wrenching enough to lose this match the semi final
6912340 i have faith in this team to lift itself for the next match
6912341 its such a breach of trust that i am disappointed that the police are unable to take action under existing law
6912342 cyf need to actively push for this person to be rejected from the profession

6912365 our inspector was following routine procedure for securing the aircraft that were on the tarmac
6912366 the right to fork is like the right to strike the right to sue or the right to bear arms you dont want to have to exercise any of these rights but its a signal of serious danger when anyone tries to take them away

6912368 were going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it
6912369 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
6912370 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
6912371 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
6912372 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all

6912386 doing shows and flying economy nobody ever fed me or id be staying in hotels so cheap that by the time id get in there wasnt any room service
6912387 i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose
6912388 youd be on shoots with bad food or get on a plane and the food would be so disgusting you couldnt eat it
6912389 you go to a show and theres no food at all so if youre doing shows back to back you can forget eating
6912390 i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin i hated it i never liked being that skinny
6912391 so many of my friends have had them and theyve gone wrong

6912413 i am so tired of hearing about the rv workers already there are other people in this world who bust their butt for their job and get let go after 3 yrs maybe some people should stop all their complaining and go out and clean toilets for a leaving at least it is a job
6912414 harsh as this sounds the problem largely is that the rv industry has created a society of largely undereducated overpaid workers with no hs diplomas many cannot pass a drug screen i know this first hand that are making in excess of 1000 1500 per week when applying for work now they say well ill take 18 per hour and are absolutely flabbergasted that with their limited education and skill set the market may now command 10 per hour its sad really
6912415 look folks if you got education you will always be able to find work our government pays you to go to school higher education i am a full time student full time factory worker just trying to get my degree so i can get out of this mess and i do not make 1000 a week try 35 40 000 per year for the last 10 yrs i have made it this long paying for a house kid in private school and a family so dont come crying we all know that manufacturing is risky in this area get an education

6912428 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
6912429 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
6912430 because extractions of wisdom teeth are commonly operated in dental clinics we can expect a lot of donors of stem cells
6912431 that enable us to create stem cells of various genetic codes eliminating the risk that a body of a patient would reject transplanted tissues or organs

6912448 i had never seen anything so beautiful in my life she was like an angel
6912449 however it doesnt mean that we cant take action against him just because he is a vip
6912450 a pair of kerouacs armed with sharpies and erasers and righteous indignation
6912451 discovered a hand rendered sign inside that i regret to report contained a few errors
6912452 i was reluctant to disfigure the sign any further still i think i shall be haunted by that perversity emense in my train whistle blighted dreams tonight
6912453 statement on the signage of our national parks and public lands to come
6912454 democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard
6912455 there is scarcely any part of science or anything in nature which those imposters and blasphemers of science called priests as well christians as jews have not at some time or other perverted or sought to pervert to the purpose of superstition and falsehood
6912456 our armies do not come into your cities and lands as conquerors or enemies but as liberators
6912457 a question for you would you rather bucknell make the ncaas once every 20 years or so and get ass raped by teams like kansas in the first round or have them drop down a rung to a confernce where they can compete for a title
6912458 i have no beef with humanity its the people i cant stand
6912459 i am involved in moves to devise an exit strategy because we are dealing with an extraordinary matter
6912460 i would imagine there is a strong consideration that when the decision is made they want it to have legitimacy and that it is not possible for people to attack the judgement as biased or because the judges are counter revolutionaries
6912461 man it would be pretty lame if the wind blew my skirt up
6912462 i dont even look at that end of the table any more
6912463 but chelsea and united are still the teams to beat and when manchester united finish their business they are going to be formidable again if they get the striker they want they will be even stronger although they didnt do badly without him last season
6912464 i think were stronger with the four players weve brought in but the most important thing for me was to keep the nucleus of the team together
6912465 i was informed that wigan want to sign me on loan but they are yet to contact middlesbrough
6912466 wigans coach steve bruce admires my abilities he tried to sign me when he was in charge of birmingham and now he has renewed his interest i will take my final decision next week after meeting gareth southgate
6912467 ledley has a particular way of preparing for games we look after him in a special way physically
6912468 we have to take things on a match by match basis whether he is going to feature depends on how he feels its a case of looking at how he is and taking the decision prior to games his knee is not something we can predict a month ahead or a season ahead it is something we need to look at short term it is important we dont take any risks at all with his fitness by putting him in when he is not right
6912469 it is like having a rolls royce in the garage
6912470 ledley is the type of player who without a doubt would walk into any side he is an absolutely top notch player when we can play him we will always line him up
6912471 he has had injury problems throughout his career and its a tragedy really but football is like that the game today is so demanding physically that you cant possibly put players in your side unless they are 100 or very close to it
6912472 we have got one or two areas that we need to look at defensively maybe solve a few problems at the back
6912473 the technical staff chat about them and we have discussions with the sporting director damien comolli
6912474 not respecting the fair play rules in tapping up players
6912475 ars ne wenger doesnt usually make comments like that so it must have been a bit of a slip
6912476 the liverpool situation means that he is not at his best
6912477 my own view from an aston villa perspective is that gareth has played exceptionally well
6912478 he came on against odense and he did great i thought he did remarkably well in the game in iceland and i thought against manchester city he played exceptionally well his fitness is getting there its been a bit stop start because he hasnt had a proper pre season as such the uncertainty of everything is there but it certainly hasnt looked to have had any effect on him
6912479 i find myself going down the line looking at the different players beckham quality gerrard quality everyone quality
6912480 i think its fair to say that i appreciate football and everything that comes with it maybe a bit more than some premier league players
6912481 you get some who go straight into the premier league and dont know anything else but ive seen what its like in the other divisions too i came through the youth ranks at orient and the club was so skint one year we did an entire pre season on hackney marshes
6912482 i dont think they could afford a cleaner so the young lads did it all we had to brush the stands paint the ground scrub the toilets get the mud out of everyones boots but i wouldnt change it for the world its completely different now and maybe some people have it a little too easy id like to see it go back to how it was because the old way was the best way it gave us a bit of discipline helped us appreciate what we were working for but these days the apprentices dont have to do a lot
6912483 im just happy that a club like aston villa wanted me
6912484 martin oneill didnt have to sell me the club its a great club with great history an ambitious new owner in randy lerner a manager who is enthusiastic and passionate about the game and a real feeling that the club is on the up thats the feeling that you pick up that there are exciting times ahead so martin oneill didnt have to persuade me to join this is exactly what i wanted
6912485 it wasnt about getting back into the england set up and it wasnt about reading going down
6912486 id made up my mind a long time before that it was hard in a way because i had been at reading for seven years and until the final season it was never ending success it was a brilliant story and i was there from the start so i will always have a great feeling for the club but i just decided i was at the age where i needed to push on improve myself id come to the conclusion that if i came to retire and id played at reading all my life i would probably regret it
6912487 i made it clear to steve coppell at the end of last summer that i wanted to move on west ham made a bid for me and that would have been a club i was interested in because i was born in chadwell heath but it never happened it was hard at times and last season there were a few fans questioning me when we were losing games but i hope overall they respect me for what i did with the club and for trying to leave in a dignified way i was never going to start stamping my feet and throwing in transfer requests after seven years at the club i was never going to act like that
6912488 he gave me so much confidence to become the player i am today
6912489 i can remember my first season and even back then he would tell me i could push on and play for my country id look at him and think are you sure this is the second division but hed seen something in me and that in turn gave me faith in my own ability
6912490 id got an infection my foot had completely ballooned up and the doctors told me afterwards they might have had to amputate fortunately we caught it early but i can remember lying in hospital one day with tears in my eyes i was fortunate because my wife emily was unbelievably strong and i got through because of her i was on an intravenous drip for two weeks and when they let me go home a nurse saw me for an hour and a half every day to feed another drip into my arm that went on for three months
6912491 its the only reason why villa were suddenly in the market for a left back and if it hadnt happened i probably wouldnt be here i really feel for him
6912492 im 27 and its a good age for a footballer to push on and really improve
6912493 ive come here to become a better footballer then maybe after that i might get another crack with england i was in fabio capellos first squad but then it got cut down and i was left out and since then i havent featured at all its not too deflating because when theres ashley cole and wayne bridge around i always knew it would be hard to get in but playing for a club of villas stature will probably help they say it doesnt matter whether you play for a big club or not but the reality is that it probably does
6912494 last year carlos was a great player for the club probably the best in the squad
6912495 i would like to think i would still be here even if he hadnt gone but i suppose it his transfer made a difference because the chairman came straight out and said the manager would be able to use the money to bring in more players in that regard it helped because soon after the clubs agreed a fee for me
6912496 i wouldnt say regret but i think at the time i probably knew in my heart of hearts it wasnt the right move i knew it wasnt the club i wanted to play for and thankfully i came back
6912497 we cant operate a plant with police protection if that is the way it is before we start then what would happen when we operate
6912498 if anybody is under the impression that since we have made the investment we will not move then we will move to protect our people
6912499 in fact its almost 100 percent more this year than it was the previous two years
6912500 theres no question theres a variety of suggestions that people are in fact returning
6912501 remittances which is the money immigrants send home to mexico have gone down dramatically over the past year again probably part the economy but also part enforcement leading to fewer people being here
6912502 so the mother is saying we should return home with the breadwinner of the family to mexico and the children are saying i dont want to leave im a u s citizen i dont know that country
6912503 wow even the illegals are getting out of the usa
6912504 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6912505 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6912506 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
6912507 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
6912508 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws
6912509 were trying to say what is the best way to approach this issue
6912510 whether the style of behavior demonstrated by a university president or a professor at a dinner or reception will be replicated by freshmen let loose at their first friday night keg party
6912511 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
6912512 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6912513 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6912514 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights
6912515 wed even raise a glass to him that is if we could
6912516 she wanted her picture taken and she was up on the ledge
6912517 her sandal got caught thats when i saw my mom trip over a rock and i saw my mom fall forward
6912518 dusk radio on teakettle whistling war news from iraq while a raven flies northeast cocking his shoulder each time he caws letting himself fall a little as if hes been hit then righting his wings mocking our human confusion and penchant for war as a hard wind drives daylight away
6912519 i know its been reported but im seeing even high net worth borrowers decide that paying on that sort of debt simply doesnt make sense theyd rather conserve cash or put in into something more useful
6912520 fannie mae will not purchase or securitize any mortgage loan that meets the definition of a subprime home loan under new york law regardless of whether any provision of the law is preemptedparticular mortgage or for a particular originator
6912521 creates the potential for heightened legal and business risk exposures for the purchasers or assignees of these loans
6912522 fannie and freddie didnt purchase a lot of subprime as he suggests but its also true that the gses are the only game in town right now
6912523 el asesinato fue cometido en el marco de un ataque sistem tico a la poblaci n civil llevado a cabo por las organizaciones terroristas
6912524 el poder legislativo nacional resultar a responsable por cuanto el 26 de junio de 1973 amnisti a los guerrilleros sin desarmarlos suprimi la c mara federal en lo penal y la legislaci n antiterrorista dejando en libertad a algunos de los que secuestraron al militar
6912525 la estrategia de los ex guerrilleros estaba centrada en considerar prescriptos sus asesinatos secuestros y torturas por tratarse de delitos comunes realizados sin participaci n estatal
6912526 las cr nicas parlamentarias prueban que la clase pol tica contribuy a la tragedia sobreviniente calificando a quienes hab an sido condenados por hechos terroristas como perseguidos pol ticos que lucharon por la liberaci n y contra la dependencia
6912527 el desarrollo de las organizaciones guerrilleras en la argentina escapa a tipificaciones simplistas el erp prt no era una fuerza progresista sino una organizaci n revolucionaria que pretend a instaurar una sociedad marxista inspirada por el faro de la revoluci n cubana desde sus or genes consider que la v a pac fica al socialismo era una imposibilidad por lo que el cambio social s lo podr a llegar a trav s de una guerra revolucionaria
6912528 la violaci n de los derechos humanos de larrabure tuvo lugar en ocasi n de un conflicto armado conforme los lineamientos de la jurisprudencia internacional que en la causa milosevic ha explicado que el concepto de conflicto armado requiere nicamente que existan grupos armados organizados que sean capaces de librar combate y que de hecho lo hagan
6912529 sus ataques fueron sistem ticos pues estuvieron organizados de acuerdo con una pol tica y un plan n tidamente delineados
6912530 that there is something beyond comedy and its called tedium
6912531 weve moved into the era when there are no secrets
6912532 a leader an extrovert a consummate businessman dependable organised health conscious a terrific golfer and a great drummer
6912533 they couldnt get me to smoke a joint or nothing i just never did i didnt drink i didnt smoke i was a teetotaller
6912534 when i leave nat i dont expect to play any more music i think ive done just about everything i could do studios tv jazz
6912535 watching television can slow the development of children under three even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them
6912536 the number of studies is growing all the time that shows there are physiological bad effects particularly on under threes associated with watching television obesity shortsightedness and premature puberty are just some of the effects that have been documented we are no longer talking about opinion were talking about medical facts
6912537 it can be beneficial it can help with cognitive development
6912538 you cant on the one hand say listening to mozart helps a baby and on the other say putting music or sounds together with pictures is somehow different
6912539 its clearly not a good idea to dump kids in front of the telly for long periods of time but the reality is that children do watch tv and its a lot better for them to watch programmes aimed specifically at them than programmes aimed at adults which is what will happen if quality programmes for young children stop being made
6912540 this is a symbolic wake up call that television for babies and young children is a health risk as such i welcome it
6912541 there is a notable year on year decrease in rewards being paid out
6912542 in 2007 08 less than 1 of informants claimed the reward they are entitled to of at least 1 000 the key motivating factor for people to phone our number is that they are vulnerable and feel trapped
6912543 we have downplayed the rewards in our marketing and concentrated our messages on the communities doing the right thing
6912544 an interesting comparison is the us crimestoppers programme where the rewards payout is around 70
6912545 they talkt of his having a cardinals hat theyd send him as soon an old nuns twat
6912546 on tuesday an uhlan to her twat put his tool in
6912547 divorce me and youll have a slot for this new twat whats her name
6912548 no woman wants to find out she has a twat like a horse collar
6912549 three thousand legal cases which have been lodged against me in the past eight years i cannot speak about them because i would be in contempt of court
6912550 i dont know if any will end up in the art fair i do not think anybody knows i can tell my own work and often find them in museums wrongly identified by made up captions
6912551 all three divisions are growing strongly and the business has real momentum our focus on europes diverse transport markets gives us resilience and great potential for further growth
6912552 results were slightly ahead of our forecasts due to better than expected performance of the uk bus division
6912553 we have attractive value for money propositions for fare paying passengers looking to switch from more fuel intensive car and air journeys and for public authorities as they acknowledge the proven financial benefits of private sector delivery
6912554 we are confident of reporting considerable revenue and earnings growth for the full year
6912555 millions upon millions of pounds continue to pour into shareholders pockets todays announcement perfectly illustrates why britains rail and bus services must be returned to public ownership
6912556 i think its a joke we know they cant raise the money from everything weve heard
6912557 they are misleading the market its about time they put up or shut up their original press release has been blown out of the water
6912558 the takeover panel should do something about it gfk should explain themselves they have misled the market and been economical with the actualit it was disingenuous and outrageous to put that release out
6912559 a serious and substantial investor and talks are progressing very well
6912560 this whole bid has been a terrible process all is fair in love and war but theyre not doing the business much good
6912561 the value of the local sponsorship for 2012 is much greater now than it was three or four weeks ago because of the performance of the team they have done a good deal
6912562 we would expect this offer to be accepted around 60 is held by six shareholders including three benfield executives the intention is to build a major reinsurance broker
6912563 after the disposal unite will have no presence in the cities where the sale assets are located that is unite is exiting cities where it does not want or cannot achieve critical mass and returns comparable with higher growth locations for example london
6912564 gamestops comments suggest continued market strength and any further step up in used game sales would clearly be a positive for game group margins and profit forecasts
6912565 the fact this number of verification measures has been taken in relation to one company when there is a developing corporate conflict between the russian and foreign shareholders of the tnk bp group over a short period of time provides a basis for concluding that there has been an abuse of power by the state labour inspectorate as well as a possible interest on its part in the outcome of the inspections
6912566 all their actions were purposefully focused on imposing the administrative liability of rw dudley alone the unambiguous conclusion is that the said officials were carrying out somebodys orders and we request that this be investigated
6912567 all the checks that took place at the firm were done by the law
6912568 we have a lot to do and will have to deliver it in increasingly difficult economic circumstances
6912569 the crisis is if you are losing customers and we have resolved that issue almost everywhere
6912570 who is going to want to buy city link when it is losing money and who is in the best place to fix it i am convinced we can do it in three to four years time we can think about our portfolio
6912571 for years gordon brown boasted about consecutive quarters of economic growth now economic growth has ground to a halt and browns bubble has burst millions of people are paying an unfair price for labours economic incompetence and the fact the prime minister didnt put money aside during the good times to prepare for a rainy day
6912572 we now have official confirmation that the british economy has already reached the point of stagnation any further slowdown and well be in outright recession were now seeing the full extent of the self delusion which led ministers to believe that everything was well with the british economy
6912573 the economy now looks set to grow by just 1 2 or so this year with a very strong chance of a technical recession in the second half
6912574 there is nowhere for the uk consumer to go but to continue to retrench real income growth has slumped as inflation accelerated while nominal pay growth remained subdued households can no longer resort to their borrow and spend habit
6912575 the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high commodity prices as well as the uncertainty in the credit markets the governments priority is to guide britain through these challenging times while also supporting those hit hardest as a result of these global factors
6912576 2 behind a game title and youve got a safe bet more of the same its makes it easier for developers to release another game and players get what essentially amounts to more levels of a game they already like

6912581 o campeonato italiano desta temporada deve ser muito disputado pois os clubes se refor aram muito a inter de mil o sempre dif cil de ser superada pois tem uma grande equipe e venceu os ltimos tr s italianos
6912582 sempre muito bom iniciar a temporada com um t tulo e vamos tentar o bicampeonato da supercopa teremos um cl ssico dif cil contra a inter de mil o mas queremos a vit ria
6912583 a diretoria da roma manteve a base do time da ltima temporada quando conquistamos a copa da it lia e o vice campeonato italiano e contratou jogadores importantes como j lio baptista e riise
6912584 prior to 1991 air power thinking was generally divided in two
6912585 the foremost limits of a series of areas in which ground combat units are deployed excluding the areas in which the covering or screening forces are operating designated to coordinate fire support the positioning of forces or the maneuver of units
6912586 if you pass the fscl on a deep mission can you still get cas
6912587 single uninterrupted decisive operation by merging the tactical operational and strategic levels of war into a single one in other words the u s was able to fight more rapid decisive continuous operations
6912588 a cog is therefore not a source of strength but a factor of balance
6912589 for connections among the various parts of an adversary or adversaries in order to determine what holds them together
6912590 in planning war operations for it describes that point where the enemy is most vulnerable and the point where an attack will have the best chance of being decisive
6912591 every level of warfare has a center or centers of gravity if several centers of gravity are involved force must be applied to all if the object is to be moved perhaps the most important responsibility of a commander is to identify correctly and strike appropriately enemy centers of gravity in some cases the commander must identify specific reachable centers of gravity if he has neither the resources nor the authorization to act against the ultimate centers in any event theater operations must be planned coordinated and executed with the idea of defeating the enemy by striking decisive blows
6912592 effects based operations ebo are a spin off of network centric warfare ncw hence many of its premises are largely unproven if not outright false ebo and ncw proponents essentially see war as a business
6912593 a deeply flawed systems approach for assessing situations and identifying centers of gravity
6912594 appear to infer causality in a deterministic way without quantifying
6912595 united states joint forces command has been developing this concept for over 5 years and to the same degree as the standing joint force headquarters established in each of theregional combatant commands integration and application vary widely
6912596 joint doctrine bound by a paradigm that limits doctrinal treatment to extant capabilities has introduced the idea of effects and an effects based approach to planning and assessment in mature revision efforts to key publications joint publications 3 0 and 5 0
6912597 though an airman boyd was not an airpower theorist and in fact was little concerned about how to design an air campaign or a strictly air war
6912598 kinetic weapons as defined here are weapons whose effects are transmitted by the motion of a substance such as a projectile a shock wave or heat departing from the conventional definition nonkinetic weapons include
6912599 weve migrated the number of sorties it will take to hit a target to the number of targets that one sortie can strike
6912600 the kamikaze was the deadliest aerial anti shipping threat faced by allied surface warfare forces in the war
6912601 most republican guard divisions outside baghdad were not reduced in number by 50 as some reports at the time claimed but they were reduced to only 20 of their original combat efficiency by the bombing with a thousand coalition planes in the sky coupled with a number of apache and black hawk helicopters and thousands of munitions directed to precise locations by ground spotters the u s infantry was able to obtain the auxiliary power of several traditional armoured divisions
6912602 if you had offered the b 1 with jdams in direct support of ground forces as a solution 10 years ago i would have laughed heartily because its not what we envisioned
6912603 cas and gaps operations do not care what color of airpower is delivering the weapons
6912604 bomber cas however at the joint cas symposium held at eglin the navy and marine corps were successful in not letting the air force call this by a different name
6912605 if heavy bombers are supporting ground troops in the traditional cas role then a name change for that aspect is not needed
6912606 precision firepower called in by tacps on the ground is gaps and needs its own doctrine
6912607 the capability to disable promptly an enemys center of gravity indeed to destroy the enemys society as a functioning entity was substantially enhanced with the introduction ofthermonuclear fusion weapons in the early 1950s and with the development of long range ballistic missiles which further compressed the time needed to execute nuclear strategic strikes the prospective military utility in a strategic sense i e employing such strikes to achieve political ends of this capability diminished substantially once the soviet union acquired significant numbers of nuclear weapons
6912608 a case in point involved the first non stealthy attack on one target in the basra area shaiba airfield with three aim points
6912609 an attack to damage or destroy an objective or a capability
6912610 a strong case can be made that the united states should take steps to create a new strategic strike triad relying on its precision and electronic strike capabilities to form two of the three legs with a smaller residual nuclear force comprising the third leg
6912611 cas affects the land battle in the now bai contributes directly to the land battle in the short or near term in the next few hours or maybe as late as the next day
6912612 air action by fixed and rotary wing aircraft against hostile targets that are in close proximity to friendly forces and that require detailed integration of each air mission with the fire and movement of those forces
6912613 in close air support artillery mortar and naval gunfire support fires it is the term included in the method of engagement segment of a call for fire which indicates that friendly forces are within close proximity of the target the close proximity distance is determined by the weapon and munition fired
6912614 a mission that integrates offensive and defensive operations to attain and maintain a desired degree of air superiority counterair missions are designed to destroy or negate enemy aircraft and missiles both before and after launch
6912615 with the likely distances to be traversed and the weight and number of weapons to be carried sufficient built in range and endurance will be almost impossible to attain the need for operational air to air refueling aar capability is compelling and must be featured in all planning
6912616 the ability to change roles quickly from oca attack offensive sweep sead and dca even while airborne on a mission can compensate for low numbers of aircraft and represents a key requirement for the pafs force structure
6912617 for offensive sweep operations knowledge of likely enemy rules of engagement roe would be crucial if attrition is to be avoided when positive identification of possible targets is required
6912618 offensive sweeps require suitable air to air weapons in terms of both quality and quantity effective all aspect short range missiles beyond visual range bvr missiles as well as a gun comprise a generally accepted package since air to air engagements can be short and intense the ability to carry an adequate quantity of missiles will be important in such operations for the same reason base stockpiling and resupply must be carefully managed in a prolonged conflict
6912619 land based airpower deployed far forward more often than not surpasses carrier aviation for sheer combat punch and staying power the air force has a long history of identifying building and sustaining such airfields to help the us make the most of all forms of airpower
6912620 can be a great combat multiplier air medevac eases the burden on already scarce evacuation assets and speeds the flow of critically wounded patients to the rear

6912638 h muita rivalidade entre as equipes e muitos lutar o pelo
6912639 analisou sobre a champions o brasileiro disse uma competi o dif cil em que n o se permite errar se o time fizer como fez no ano passado penso que chegaremos longe
6912640 fui apelidado assim pois sou forte fisicamente e dif cil me parar n o tem uma conota o negativa
6912641 mudei para melhor penso que jogando na roma continuarei a jogar na sele o brasileira
6912642 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6912643 open markets attract investment sign treaties and promote business agreements
6912644 tenemos pocas iniciativas globales ning n liderazgo tem tico en la regi n estamos muy poco presentes en los foros internacionales donde de manera confusa a veces y siempre dificultosa se van negociando las reglas de juego que luego tendremos que cumplir
6912645 hay un conjunto de pa ses que comparten ciertas caracter sticas y tienen un terreno para entenderse
6912646 it appears as if there is a fear that if this is honestly discussed people will hate all illegal immigrants so there is silence but in being silent about the rapes and murders it is as if the victims never even existed
6912647 it appears as if there is a fear that if this is honestly discussed people will hate all illegal immigrants

6912649 we will be bring you some romance and seduction this month is a mini series that has a brilliant mix of romance drama suspense and wittiness that i am sure 8tv viewers will enjoy
6912650 this tv series is also filled with interesting plots and storyline that will get viewers craving for more
6912651 blogs nowadays are very common especially among teenagers and young adults so the addition and usage of a blog as the new communication medium in this series will be interesting and relevant to the audience
6912652 clear is all about re enacting dilemmas of youth and create awareness about the importance of being ready and confident among our younger generation this strategic partnership will also be a vehicle to reach out to todays youth with a clear need of confidence boosters in the current environment that they live in our main focus of this campaign is to communicate to youth to be ever ready given opportunities that come their way
6912653 besides this continuous main story each episode also features a different problem scenario where a regular guy seeks ms help to solve his romantic dilemma
6912654 despite the racy title this show is actually all about finding and creating romance as well as understanding the opposite sex
6912655 yep and neither can make good spaghetti its a disaster waiting to happen
6912656 yep they both like it really rough if you get my drift
6912657 yep theyre such an ugly couple that i doubt theyll even fill this frame
6912658 yep lorena is trying to see if its better the second time around
6912659 ive got a soft spot for spurs i like the way they play football and the attacking players theyve got
6912660 we looked at tottenham and knew they would be looking to move some players on certain people had stuck in my mind from when we played them last season and we were delighted to get them it was good business
6912661 their new manager wanted to bring in his own players and there was a deal to be had hopefully they will not get too bogged down by being back at their old club on saturday
6912662 sometimes that is good but sometimes i think you should keep the big players you inherit
6912663 it was a difficult season for me after martin jol left we only finished 11th and if we hadnt won the carling cup it would have been a dead season for me it was not nice often being out of the team that situation is something i have never experienced before
6912664 roy keane and juande ramos are similar managers but maybe keane talks a bit more to the players than ramos did because of the language barrier i prefer that
6912665 i want the manager to talk to me to tell me whats happened and why im not in the team
6912666 people who had played under martin jol suddenly didnt play anymore or were played out of position
6912667 theres great ambition here and i get the same feeling about how the club want to push on that i had when i first arrived at tottenham
6912668 i think people are starting to take notice of sunderland now and for a big world star like ciss to have joined us is a good sign
6912669 we are ambitious not necessarily more than spurs but more than most clubs in the premier league spurs want to finish fourth which is not our aim yet but we still want to do well roy keane is building a team and its exciting to be part of i think sunderland can do something big this season
6912670 the fact he has played over 40 international games shows he has a lot to offer
6912671 the fed looks firmly on hold for many months caught between ongoing inflation concerns existing relatively low rates and the financial storm he talks about
6912672 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6912673 nevertheless the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain not least because of the difficulty of predicting the future course of commodity prices and we will continue to monitor inflation and inflation expectations closely the fed is committed to achieving medium term price stability and will act as necessary to attain that objective
6912674 you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6912675 right now the situation is still getting worse and i would say that i dont see any early end to that
6912676 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
6912677 theyre too big to fail that doesnt mean that the equity cant get wiped out and it almost has in a practical sense as institutions they dont have any net worth

6912706 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6912707 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6912708 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
6912709 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
6912710 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws
6912711 were trying to say what is the best way to approach this issue
6912712 whether the style of behavior demonstrated by a university president or a professor at a dinner or reception will be replicated by freshmen let loose at their first friday night keg party
6912713 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
6912714 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6912715 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6912716 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights

6912718 toll roads face a more uncertain future than other transportation sectors
6912719 based on continued weakness in enplanements and toll paying traffic volumes that are being adversely affected by more than seven months of volatile fuel prices economic weakness and inflationary pressures
6912720 an approximately 33 increase in gasoline prices and a 52 increase in jet fuel prices from 2007
6912721 the question is could that continue and could that be a shift in the paradigm
6912722 on the surface side continued pressure could result in the federal government providing a larger increase in funding for transit with more limited growth for highways in addition we could also see a longer term shift in population trends with growth accelerating in the urban core and slowing in suburban areas where driving in congestion is currently a part of daily life
6912723 the combination of policy and demographic shifts could have a significant impact for toll road credits over the longer term as they will likely take a much longer time to develop if they do materialize prospects for roads dependent upon sustained long term growth could be impacted

6912756 no industrial or sewage related discharges may affect the beach area
6912757 some sewage overflow pipes are discharging constantly when they shouldnt be
6912758 we know these overflows will be discharging more often now with the rain we have had this summer the sewage is heavily contaminated effluent and big pieces of debris which includes sanitary items plastic and organic waste which is flushed down the toilet
6912759 the treatment works are suffering because of the unseasonal heavy rainfalls we are getting and because of that they have to dispose of some of the sewage untreated through a combined sewage and storm water overflow
6912760 we regularly clean this beach but you can see cotton bud sticks and tampon applicators we know that surfers and bodyboarders whose sports result in swallowing seawater are three times more at risk than the average bather of picking up something like gastroenteritis

6912774 come to a conclusion about how best to configure a uk trade and investment body
6912775 through its orchestrated campaigns affecting all those involved in the use of medicines the pharmaceutical industry enormously influences what patients are prescribed on the whole these influences are detrimental to best practice
6912776 declarations of interest are a key way to help break the pharmaceutical industrys stranglehold it is not a trivial issue public declarations by doctors are essential if prescribing is to be sensible and appropriate and according to patients needs
6912777 when a medical professional speaks on a health issue we assume that they are putting patients interests first if that person has a conflict of interest because they or their organisation are receiving funding from a drug company the least we should demand is the right to know about it
6912778 pharmaceutical companies will tell you that what they are funding is medical education but our concern is that this is really highly effective well targeted marketing this throws any notion of impartiality out of the window and jeopardises a doctors ability to make an informed balanced decision about the most appropriate treatments
6912779 countries such as the us and australia have woken up to this issue and are now requiring pharmaceutical companies to disclose their funding of medical organisations and medical education european regulators have been sleeping on the job
6912780 its not true its part of a huge marketing budget its all about maximising their profits not helping people in life threatening situations
6912781 if it is done through the local rep who may expect some sort of favour in exchange for that sponsorship there is more stringent regulation
6912782 those doctors are seeing reps on a regular basis and although it is explicitly stated in the abpi rules that there shouldnt be any conflict or conditions on the funding it probably does influence doctors behaviour because they are unsure whether they will get further sponsorship for going to further meetings so it is useful to them to engender good relationships with different reps
6912783 one has to be careful how one judges oneself but when you get to my level where you are getting a lot of interest from different companies you can pick and choose to a certain extent if you feel uncomfortable about any particular request or association you can very easily walk away if im asked to put certain points across in a talk which i think are biased i wont do it in the best interests of patient care
6912784 i certainly think it would be preferable if sponsorship or money for travelling to meetings was independent from the pharmaceutical companies but there is no pot of money for providing that
6912785 i dont give a toss what the drug company rep says i prescribe drugs which give benefit to my patients
6912786 it runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and set down by the external contractor and certainly set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor
6912787 reviewing the terms of that contract and other contracts with pa consulting
6912788 i am shocked by the level of expenditure on consultants and even more shocked by the way the government seems to have become dependent on consultants for the delivery of core public services
6912789 the public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their 20bn id card project to the firm involved in this fiasco
6912790 this will destroy any confidence the public still have in this white elephant and reinforce why it could endanger rather than strengthen our security
6912791 frankly the keystone cops would do a better job running the home office and keeping our data safe than this government and if this government cannot keep the data of thousands of guilty people safe why on earth should we give them the data of millions of innocent people in an id card database
6912792 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels

6912815 this was a conviction obtained in the most appalling of circumstances my client feels it was an unfair trial and a travesty of justice we need to inquire whether this conviction should be recognised by this court
6912816 far far below what is acceptable in western european standards
6912817 the fact remains that mr gadd was aware what the police were intending to do at least three or four days ago mr gadds situation is clear mr gadd has been convicted of a relevant offence and the fact of that conviction cannot possibly be challenged
6912818 mr gadd has demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
6912819 he didnt seem to have any bags and was shouting at the taxi driver asking him where he was
6912820 it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety and these past few days have enabled the metropolitan police and i on his behalf to put into place a proper procedure for his protection and his wellbeing
6912821 they had their identities changed but here we have someone in the public eye and in terms of a new identity you cant really give him one i would have thought that the police will conclude that the measures they have to put in place will be minimal

6912864 our work is the first to demonstrate the synthesis of composite nanorods with branching wherein each nanorod consists of two materials a single crystal bismuth telluride nanorod core encased in a hollow cylindrical shell of single crystal bismuth sulfide
6912865 branching and core shell architectures have been independently demonstrated but this is the first time that both features have been simultaneously realized through the use of a biomolecular surfactant
6912866 our single step synthesis is an important development toward realizing large scale synthesis of composite nanomaterials in general
6912867 our discovery enables the realization of two very important attributes for heat dissipation and power generation from heat
6912868 first the core shell junctions in the nanorods are conducive for heat removal upon application of an electrical voltage or generating electrical power from heat second the branched structures open up the possibility of fabricating miniaturized conduits for heat removal alongside nanowire interconnects in future device architectures
6912869 since lgta is similar to biological molecules our discovery could be conceivably used as a starting point to explore the use of proteins and enzymes to atomically sculpt such nanorod architectures through biological processes
6912870 surfactant directed synthesis of branched bismuth telluride sulfide core shell nanorods
6912871 dna chips have revolutionised biological and medical science for many years scientists have tried to develop similar protein chips but technical difficulties associated with attaching large numbers of proteins to surfaces have prevented their widespread application
6912872 the method we have developed could have profound applications in the diagnosis of disease screening of new drugs and in the detection of bacteria pollutants toxins and other molecules
6912873 i believe that this article typifies the dangerous trend towards americocentrism in u
6912874 washington should demand that its allies abandon ongoing plans or forego ambitions to develop these technologies
6912875 at home the new administration should redirect funding currently provided to the national labs for reprocessing and fast neutron reactor research to programs that improve and reduce the cost of safeguards technology explore ways to make uranium enrichment more proliferation resistant and develop renewable energy

6912880 i had to pedal it pretty hard coming off of turn two because i got back to the gas pretty quick and it shoved the front end a little bit he said
6912881 all in all it ended up being a pretty good lap it gave us a good pit selection and good starting position
6912882 i just got a little free and i felt like i would have enough track to chase it and just didnt get out of the throttle he said

6912903 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6912904 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6912905 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
6912906 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
6912907 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws
6912908 were trying to say what is the best way to approach this issue
6912909 whether the style of behavior demonstrated by a university president or a professor at a dinner or reception will be replicated by freshmen let loose at their first friday night keg party
6912910 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
6912911 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6912912 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6912913 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights

6912916 brazils exemplary coffee artistry paired with the cup of excellence prescient vision forever changed the history of modern coffee with great joy well soon savor brazils most amazing 2008 coffees
6912917 this has become a very important quality standard for all the farms that participate in the program because the evaluations throughout each phase of the competition are so stringent that if a lot reaches the national jury but does not make it to auction that coffee is still regarded as a winner further the greater objective of the program is to reach the largest number of the producers so that the quality can be elevated at all levels of the farm
6912918 i just bought a toshiba d r410 a week ago it has something they call
6912919 a disk burned with the liteon units can be placed in a cyberhome 600 or 1200 and brings up a message that the disk was not made in a cyberhome and asks if i want to make it compatible a yes answer will do that and change the thumb nails and format and finalize them they can be played in any unit including the liteon inits
6912920 i was under the impression from other members posts that some recorder brands rca polaroid use the expression
6912921 a disk burned with the liteon units can be placed in a cyberhome 600 or 1200 and brings up a message that the disk was not made in a cyberhome and asks if i want to make it compatible a yes answer will do that and change the thumb nails and format and finalize them
6912922 i was teased because of what i was growing up being japanese black and white and not knowing what group you fit into or where you belong who your friends should be
6912923 if you do something to them youre going to get in trouble and then its like bad either way you cant walk away and then you try to do something and you get in trouble and so its a lose lose situation when you are a victim
6912924 its a travesty in our homes its a travesty at the corner drugstore its a travesty in our schools and we need to do something about that
6912925 i just like want people to know that other people understand and that there is somebody out there who has been through it just like you
6912926 get it at the early stage when its just talking just talking i think schools should be able to do that
6912927 why dont i try and use the car just one day a week
6912928 i was reassured that it wasnt my fault that there was nothing i could have done it was his choice all of which i knew but it was good to hear from someone else
6912929 but i saw a man yesterday who knows a fellow who had it from a chappie that said that urquhart had been dipping himself a bit recklessly off the deep end
6912930 all of a sudden we now had a rule book to go by and when we had problems the preacher was right there to give us the answers
6912931 we have met with families in which for weeks together not an article of sustenance but potatoes had been used yet for every child the hard earned sum was provided to send them to school

6912935 can experts whether self proclaimed or endorsed by others publications provide reliable stock market timing guidance do some experts clearly show better intuition about overall market direction than others

6912939 whether its manpower sitting on a house transportation stopping somebody
6912940 its interesting that someone who has pulled off the types of crimes hes committed isnt a hoodlum from some big city
6912941 instead hes from a rural area in the bible belt of america
6912942 the respiratory equipment is life saving hopefully it will keep him out of the hospital he is constantly sick constantly going to the hospital
6912943 i think by this time next year well have him back
6912944 you can only ask your close friends for help for so long
6912945 we really need to branch out and ask the entire community for help
6912946 we realize the economy is tough and times are hard
6912947 the main thing is we are celebrating haydens life and the fact hes still with us
6912948 the last few days weve had people indicating that maybe these guys were railroaded
6912949 i just want to make the point that this was not one isolated incident but really was a series of issues when you have two violations within a matter of months it would appear that something is seriously amiss
6912950 you turn around and take an airplane ticket and perform on a porn site for money and it was pretty automatic at that point that we couldnt go forward
6912951 rita was a spanish saint though i dont know what of
6912952 my mum decided when i was a kid that my boats should be called rita

6912955 this type of weapon is described as being used in war zones around the world
6912956 he thought it was kind of a cool thing to have it looked like an antique
6912957 an ak 47 is a well known weapon of choice in lawless and war torn parts of the world
6912958 its hardly the type of weapon we need on the streets of whitehorse
6912959 hands down ass up thats the way we like to f ck
6912960 my problem was it wasnt diagnosed quick enough so it had already gone outside the prostate cavity
6912961 we take the bodys immune system and help it to fight the cancer
6912962 we take one of the key cells of the immune system and teach it how to fight a tumor and give it back to the patient
6912963 i think the people of florida deserve a center for excellence and thats what were trying to build
6912964 this is a way for us to produce safe materials for use in humans in clinical trails
6912965 if our concept succeeds we will be able to cure from the cancer were not there yet but that is the goal
6912966 for us to say dont go to the mall thats just not going to work
6912967 its a mall high school kids are going to the mall
6912968 you dont know when a car turns because usually they dont put their signal so you have to always be running across the street
6912969 one of our friends has like almost been hit by a car before over here and personally i dont think they shouldnt have a crosswalk
6912970 i hate for our kids to be on a dead sprint we have not had any accidents up to this point but id hate to say we finally had one gt
6912971 if its a problem who do you want me to call and then well get the facts and well get them some answers
6912972 its pretty dangerous you just have to watch what youre doing crosswalks would be nice
6912973 once you get it open a little bit you can crack it did he bite you he doesnt have teeth so it didnt hurt im sure
6912974 i like i never said id buy swampland in florida but i love it out here
6912975 when i bought the place it was flooded i couldnt even come look at it when my parents bought theirs it was flooded too they couldnt move in

6912977 there are three comedies coming out this fall aimed at women
6912978 you have seen them all before but you will see them all again
6912979 weve got to figure out and get to a point where i dont want to miss any more time it could be better tomorrow it could be better on sunday
6912980 for whatever reason my back is really guarding against letting that spasm out
6912981 its tough because when i sit down and get relaxed i try to stand up and im stiff and its hard to get moving
6912982 he actually threw the ball pretty well we just want to make sure we do the right thing
6912983 it didnt get worse but at the same time hes not going to go back out there and resume what he was doing hes going to get treatment his range of motion was good but youre not going to see him running around and catching grounders either its definitely a setback how far of a setback i just dont know
6912984 for me i just had probably the best game of my career we got in late and i was kind of tired today but a lot of guys say when youre tired you have your best days
6912985 ive heard that so many times and its never really happened to me before until today it was just a good win for us we fought back the whole game
6912986 we got beat up today what are you going to do
6912987 they came out swinging the bats they hit the ball all over the park and out of it
6912988 you know its good to hit a grand slam but i would rather it have been against somebody else
6912989 because neal and i go way back i consider him a friend i have to do my job too but if i could choose someone else i would
6912990 i walked the first guy and put us in a bigger jam than we were already in i put one over the plate and he harris put a good swing on it
6912991 he looks pretty good over there today he swung the bat well
6912992 i know im strong enough to hit the ball out of the park but im not up there trying to hit the ball out of the park
6912993 i dont know where its coming from and im not trying to figure it out
6912994 i will die alone upside down in a pub toilet
6912995 i will die alone upside down in a pub toilet
6912996 i love being from houston the people the food the fun
6912997 i love being from houston the people the food the fun
6912998 love competition love risking your pride love winning it back love giving it everything youve got love the glory love the pain love sport even when it breaks your heart
6912999 we have immediately asked relevant government departments to investigate those that started the rumour
6913000 we want to act to protect our brand reputation in the same way as any corporation would want to if people were posting or writing false accusations
6913001 this isnt about a debate on freedom of speech its simply helping us to identify the person who posted it
6913002 no invention in history has been more successful in the collection and display of stupidity than the internet
6913003 grow ops and illegal drug operations can produce property defects and health hazards that are major concerns for the public
6913004 and potential purchasers need a central place to check before buying
6913005 a year and a half ago there were charges laid in relation to five or six grow ops engaged in the cultivation of marijuana
6913006 but we dont track them in our records in terms of which residences
6913007 certainly the message we want to get out is the danger or fire because of the enormous amount of electricity thats used and the illegal tampering of electrical equipment theres definitely health risks to that
6913008 i dont know if theres been any properties sold without people knowing unless it was sold privately and the vendor didnt disclose it
6913009 if we know the house has been a grow op we make sure the purchaser has knowledge of that
6913010 as in other jurisdictions when a property changes hands these issues are handled in the purchase agreement and until the government determines a new legal direction this will remain a civil issue between the parties involved in the purchase
6913011 alex i just wanted to let you know that im not making dinner for your kids if youd like them to eat i suggest that you come home early enough to make something for them
6913012 youre mean i dont like you i love you youre the meanest
6913013 eu t numa boa tenho o presidente inteirinho do meu lado

6913016 the information i have is that if theyre leaving it is at a snails pace
6913017 the headquarters of the peacekeeping forces have been partially destroyed
6913018 have a mandate to safeguard russian interests in the region
6913019 this is going to be the best chance i have
6913020 ill have my staff get back to you on how many houses
6913021 are we ready we are ready well deal with the air well deal with the logistics well get the subway lines going

6913023 the video games business has become increasingly global with the majority of the publishers releasing games in multiple markets the u s as the worlds largest market will be able to view and compare sales for the first time outside of their own market
6913024 we cant operate a plant with police protection if that is the way it is before we start then what would happen when we operate
6913025 if anybody is under the impression that since we have made the investment we will not move then we will move to protect our people
6913026 professor martens confirmed that the players knee is inflammated and advised him to continue for 15 days with the therapeutic protocol he is following
6913027 i believe that emmanuel has been unfairly treated because he had a lot of interest from many big clubs and he always told me one to one his preference was to stay in the end he stayed
6913028 that story did not come out like that in the press and unfortunately he is paying a price for a story which is not really him
6913029 he made a press conference in austria where people interpreted his statements a bit differently but i know what he told me and i know he made sacrifices to stay i was convinced he wanted to stay but i was not always convinced he would stay because there is a big difference in that people have advisors and some clubs pay higher wages than we do we have to accept that
6913030 i watched the first half and then stopped watching because i felt the game was over
6913031 chelsea were very good but portsmouth had a bad day at the office that can happen to anybody before they could even get into the game it was already over for them
6913032 however chelsea were impressive but on one game you cannot assess too much chelsea will be one of the super candidates to fight for the title but i feel we have enough to fight with them
6913033 there was not one factor why we fell away last season it was a conjunction of a few things like injuries some bad luck as well as a bit of inexperience and nervousness
6913034 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of
6913035 i dont know if anyone told you but dad was in a car accident the van is a complete write off
6913036 apparently the van flipped over dad said he blacked out at least thats what i think he said he was being even more incoherent than usual
6913037 dads van hed been driving it around without being able to switch it to reverse
6913038 critical to the integrity of the electric grid for the entire mid atlantic region
6913039 we are extremely disappointed in this administrative recommendation which runs counter to the evidence presented
6913040 we intend to vigorously pursue construction of this line with the commission particularly the one mile section that is essential to regional reliability
6913041 its nearing the end of the process but theres still an opportunity for any parties in the case to file exceptions to the recommended decision
6913042 all of that including everything filed so far makes up the entire body of evidence used by the commission to make its decision
6913043 were still very hopeful that the commission will see things another way the judges opinions really run counter to the results weve heard so far in virginia and west virginia others saw the merits of the line and gave us a recommended decision
6913044 i would imagine by this afternoon theyll be into the bigger beams
6913045 the last time we showed you these beams they were up in the building now theyre being stacked here ready to go to the recycling mill in minnesota look at the end grain here very old wood we think its fir its the kind old growth wood you just cant get anymore
6913046 he will cut it to a builders requirements so if you want to build a home with some nice clear timber hes the guy to talk to
6913047 and you saw how well that goes over with the rick warren people
6913048 this ban on a legitimate medical procedure is clearly unconstitutional
6913049 because historically because historically we have not defined marriage in our constitution
6913050 neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states or any place subject to their jurisdiction
6913051 im pro infanticide i love sunsets and i dont get the 13th amendment

6913054 our community is made up of a few different types of people which ones do you want to be a part of anyone can help us test
6913055 wow look at all those folks seems like everyone is exercising
6913056 as a result of those mistakes some of the people who were told they would in fact be eligible to move in are by the current standards over income
6913057 our goals are to bring awareness of child safety and sexual assault to our community
6913058 something to keep us busy and not spend all our time thinking about whats going on
6913059 the cost of guinea will cease to exist by the end of this century
6913060 the countries most threatened by this looming environmental disaster are gambia nigeria burkina fasso and ghana
6913061 up to 1 000 kilometres of land may be lost in the volta delta owing to sea level rise and inundation
6913062 this will make the ground water undrinkable and unsuitable for agricultural purposes the result will be food and water insecurity
6913063 the sensible option is moving to higher ground which is a tough option especially for nigeria as it means giving up its economic centres in lagos and its oil installations in the delta
6913064 unthinkable option due to its economic social and cultural implications
6913065 the industrialised countries should take proactive steps in curtailing greenhouse gas emissions
6913066 it causes drought the farmers have to go a long way to get water and without water they cant live
6913067 some people from vietnam and laos have been coming over the border and chopping the forest down for valuable natural oil
6913068 its maybe 90 foreigners who are responsible but weve already arrested five or six of them
6913069 but rubber is powerful we know its bad for the environment but we also know that now we have electricity and life is much easier
6913070 on those important issues which affect millions of poor farmers that is an area we cant really make further concessions
6913071 what we didnt know in july was that these cases were part of a larger ontario outbreak that only became known the end of july
6913072 the issue with that is that this is a bacteria thats invisible
6913073 it doesnt take a lot its not like youre going to have dripping stuff all over the place it just happens to get in there despite having a very good system with a whole bunch of checks and balances
6913074 we wouldnt be there if we didnt see good profits out of that kind of business
6913075 bioenergy is well integrated into the paper and pulp mills where you can combine biomass coming from forests and mass production
6913076 previously wood scraps have been unused totally so this will definitely improve the companies profitability
6913077 but it is not going to change the total picture of the forestry industry it will be a side product
6913078 i think ten years from now the biofuel industry will be equally as big as the paper industry today
6913079 it will not help norske skogs earnings in the next year or two but it could be significant in the long term
6913080 i think met officials who approved these quotas are not thinking in terms of the best conservation measures for the keystone species in the kunene region but are succumbing to pressure from conservancies to earn quick bucks
6913081 the government should stop issuing problem animal and trophy permits from sept 2006 to sept 2007 12 large bulls have been shot in the kunene region as problem animals these are not bulls that have been positively identified as problems but permits issued to merely placate pressure on the met from surrounding communities this off take added to the trophy hunts could have catastrophic affects on the desert elephant population
6913082 eradicating the bulls could lead to a social breakdown and a massive loss of knowledge this knowledge is needed to alleviate the pressure on resources
6913083 misuse of resources will only lead to more conflict with humans more pressure on government and more elephants being shot this domino effect can head them to extinction faster than we can ever believe
6913084 there is huge waste and loss of water through food that is produced since roughly 50 percent of the food that farmers grow is lost or wasted
6913085 there is a need for a mentality shift it would make a lot of sense for people to waste less
6913086 that corresponds to 40 trillion litres of irrigation water enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
6913087 in many areas of the world you simply cannot store food efficiently because it is not handled well
6913088 in urban settings we have lost touch with realities people do not know where food comes from they do not know what it takes to produce food
6913089 now if you throw away half of that kilo that means youve thrown away 7 5 tonnes of water
6913090 unless we change our practices water will be a key constraint to food production in the future
6913091 gone down by 30 percent because the price went up
6913092 we pay a price here for water that is not very high but we also couple that with education and awareness so people know there is a cost to the environment to use that water
6913093 more than enough food is produced to feed a healthy global population
6913094 thats like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion litres of water into the garbage can enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people

6913141 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6913142 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6913143 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6913144 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6913145 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6913146 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6913147 the fed needs to raise interest rates now slowly and predictably to restore confidence in its continued commitment to price stability
6913148 the very business model of independent investment banks is coming under fire

6913153 there will be a time to buy lehman shares but that time has not yet arrived
6913154 solvency concerns like trading errors do not age well and we believe that the longer the market frets about lehmans balance sheet exposures the more likely counter parties are to pull back from the firm which could cause lasting damage to its franchise

6913180 our goal at the nrc is to identify and rectify potential safety concerns
6913181 i want to stress that the nrc is not a promoter of nuclear power the purposes of this meeting are to discuss the potential combined license application explain what the nrc does during the review process and describe the publics participation in the nrc review process
6913182 really three reviews in parallel a safety review technical review and environmental review which will come together at an adjudicatory meeting
6913183 i represent three nuclear power plants in this district and i look forward to representing a fourth
6913184 detroit is known for the auto industry and st louis is known for beer oswego should be the nuke capital of the country energy is a commodity that we can and should invest in as the natural resources available here lend themselves to making this region an energy mecca
6913185 we need to focus on some ability to keep energy produced locally at a lower rate this project could be a silver bullet for business development given the national energy crisis this is perfect timing to take advantage of a really unique opportunity
6913186 our regions citizens acknowledge the benefits of nuclear power and welcome the benefits of a new plant
6913187 we need to do more with energy efficiency and investing in other alternatives in order to avoid subjecting our communities to potentially devastating health effects
6913188 there is no way to remove radioactive waste were going to be placing a terrible burden on generations to come who will have to deal with our waste which is very irresponsible

6913190 i like attention i love men i like the glam outfits and the role playing i love being able to go nude in front of strangers i want them to enjoy my body i like to make men laugh in clubs i like to talk to them at stage side when theyre watching me dance
6913191 i hope that every guy who sees these pictures messes himself i hope they shoot out big gobs of cum on my photos i really get
6913192 i fantasize about having sex with two guys or having sex in public and lately about my pool contractor
6913193 you know when i think about doing a hardcore boy girl video i think to myself what are you doing having sex on camera
6913194 youre being arrested for exercising rights you thought you had but i guess you didnt have em didja
6913195 in the age of obama is street protest still relevant
6913196 a scripted and sanitized spectacle for a homogenous group of wealthy elites inside the convention hall versus a thriving organic movement of the masses outside
6913197 its to say to the whole country we are here
6913198 we plan to show that this is a crisis this is something that needs to be looked at with a little more urgency we dont have enough housing we dont have enough healthcare and its killing the people
6913199 democracy is not waiting to vote once every four years democracy is getting out in the streets
6913200 they the politicians are not gonna do it by themselves were gonna force their hand because that is the nature of democracy
6913201 especially now with a candidate who talks a lot about hope and change people talk about why do you need to protest
6913202 i think that we need to define what hope and change are we need to decide what that means to us as a people
6913203 for people who are disenfranchised by the system some of them for the first time are being motivated into politics
6913204 we want to create a broad progressive movement that can invite these newly politicized people in and we want to create a campaign that can take that beyond the voting booth
6913205 the story obama tells about how were gonna change this world by regular people taking action
6913206 creates more space for social movement organizing in a way we havent had since the 60s i would like to see the conventions and the protests around them take full advantage of that opportunity
6913207 use both conventions to put forward a narrative that we are starting a new chapter in american history our job is to be part of that progressive wave and to pull it to the left as much as we can
6913208 because obamas running they think weve got them theyre coming out theyre gonna support obama no matter what
6913209 some of us arent so sure that its gonna make a difference
6913210 the candidacy of obama is a reflection of the publics desire for something different
6913211 we believe that despite the rhetoric obama uses genuine change will always come from the bottom up and that means countering the system as a whole
6913212 people have learned that a top down approach to things doesnt work
6913213 what we have in common is a desire to break the spell that elections have over the us left
6913214 our message is one of direct participation in democracy bypassing corrupt politicians who dont represent us but instead further corporate interests
6913215 the rnc is a very easy target because they are so visibly to blame for whats happening in this country
6913216 theres a whole lot more energy for the rnc than the dnc
6913217 i dont know what to make of shutting down the rnc
6913218 id like to see more of a consciousness raising thing i dont want the left to be perceived as crazy
6913219 we know that it is the police not protesters or activists who will have the tasers guns rubber bullets concussion grenades chemical weapons helicopters the media spin machine and millions of dollars on their side
6913220 were just hoping that the denver police dont recreate the violence that happened in chicago in 68
6913221 recreate 68 at the 2008 dnc has become a point of contention all its own even among activists born decades after 1968 and bred amid a new world order
6913222 it provides inspiration and an example of what can be possible
6913223 but it can also prove a disservice if we just recreate 68 we will be destined to also recreate its problems
6913224 that culture of activist summit hopping im not really into that i do think it is important to show a resistance to both parties i just think that there are different ways that people go about doing that and i hope we dont lose steam over this election weve got a long way to go
6913225 is to get to work organizing where we are at our campuses workplaces and in our communities while at the same time building links with people struggling all around the world
6913226 we really need to find a way to engage the people who are excited and really do think that obamas gonna change something
6913227 we have to do a lot of popular education to say that it isnt politicians who make real change its the movements that politicians have to follow
6913228 why should we be forced from our house while our attackers can walk freely
6913229 we the community of kampung pulo demand the campus be closed and dissolved

6913235 we needed to play full speed tackle football and i think we scared ourselves out of playing football thursday
6913236 we threw the pads on again and said were going to play and they got excited and that fired me up they wanted to compete and it was a very crisp workout today was good medicine for everybody
6913237 this defendant took advantage allegedly along with his brother of an elderly mans poor health by swindling him out of his home
6913238 fortunately the victim who suffers from dementia was able to remain in his home and civil litigation is underway to ensure that he may remain there as the rightful owner fortunately the scheme was uncovered after the victims eldest daughter a new york city police officer became suspicious of various transactions and reported the matter to my economic crimes bureau
6913239 i am pleased by the overwhelming response from long islanders and i encourage them to continue calling with consumer complaints
6913240 we have established additional consumer phone lines dedicated to long island residents to handle the tremendous volume of calls that we are receiving about deceptive practices at gas stations the more information we receive from consumers the better and we will continue to crack down on gas stations trying to rip off long island consumers
6913241 waive his rights of communication with his daughter and grandchildren
6913242 were moving into a phase of some planning and reinvention
6913243 weve got some creative and talented people working collectively to kind of reshape what were going to look like next year
6913244 were also able to carry former wrvo shows that had small but dedicated followings such as the splendid table a cooking show calling all pets and living on earth a show about the environment
6913245 we have to raise about 30 000 in each location to finish the job
6913246 we look to complete conversion for these locations by summer 2010
6913247 have now broken the 50 barrier and more car companies have come to include hd as an option in new cars
6913248 i think it would be pretty cool to be the last guy to hit a home run in this ballpark
6913249 i think that the odds of that are pretty slim to none
6913250 but even to hit a home run here in my last at bat here would be awfully special
6913251 i am hoping to get a seat with a number 10 on it
6913252 id also like to get something blue and orange and something that says shea stadium on it
6913253 i have a corner in my basement my sanctuary for all my shea memorabilia
6913254 we both liked the name and it just seemed the perfect name
6913255 it was just right to name him after this place
6913256 were excited to bring the viewers further inside our athletic programs than ever before
6913257 we have always tried to show the viewers things they cant see anywhere else and thanks to the coaching staffs were getting an even greater level of access
6913258 we encourage laura to bring her game which is a special game to the college level with confidence
6913259 coach oshea has been a longtime friend of mine and tammys and for him to come up with this idea was brilliant it was very generous of him i know tammy and her family and our whole program are so appreciative
6913260 our position is its been bottled up in rule making and just taken too long to get done
6913261 there just seem to be too many excuses for not being assertive enough to move these things from recommendations to requirements
6913262 many of these things go back to aircraft piloting 101
6913263 were not going to be satisfied with faas efforts until theyve implemented all of them
6913264 zuma nesta rock sounds like a water park ride or a new energy drink zuma is unusual and rather appealing for a girl its said to be taken from zuma beach in malibu and while place names are great they have to fit the gender of the baby but with the a ending and the popular z beginning as in zoe zelda zora zuma just sounds too feminine so does nesta supposedly bob marleys real name and its not a good idea to pair two a endings as first and middle names too cutesy
6913265 rock is probably thrown in there just to point to the parents careers and it does help to add some masculinity
6913266 this celeb couple certainly succeeded in choosing an unusual name and they succeeded in making an even stronger statement about their fondness for jamaica kingston is named after jamaicas capital and nesta was jamaican singer bob marleys given first name
6913267 when it comes to historical naming tradition both zuma and nesta are most frequently considered girls names as this child grows up he will likely encounter some name induced gender identity issues
6913268 as for the subliminal effect the first name zuma will encourage a career in acting or music so this baby could find himself following in a parents footsteps with ease but he is also likely to flounder when it comes to communication and relationship compatibility because he carries a name that will establish a highly private nature
6913269 it seems the rossdales scarified quality for quirkiness and its a good bet little zuma may be investigating a name change at some point down the road
6913270 first of all zuma zuma is a diminutive of the aztec name montezuma not sure the rossdales realize that but its also associated with the zuma beach in los angeles which is really beautiful a lot of people are using place names now and i think they used it after the beach most likely
6913271 i would recommend that the boy grow up using the name rock rossdale because thats probably the only normal name in there hes gonna grow up in the creative community so i dont think hell get picked on too much but theres only one percent of people surveyed on babynames com that said they loved it and 50 percent said they hated it thats a lot
6913272 kingston seems so upper class and just sophisticated that everybody was expecting another name that went along with it
6913273 i brought my daughter down to get some lunch and they told me someone was murdered and i found out it was down the street from where i live
6913274 we all know each other but we dont know who it is
6913275 about media freedom and the right to protest were an illusion
6913276 we have every expectation that the president will move forward on protecting these places sometime in the fall
6913277 today we put the champagne on ice and we will pop it open
6913278 these vast pacific areas are nearly three times the size of texas
6913279 countless seabirds dolphins fishes corals and tiny things as yet undiscovered could survive as a result free of the threats that are eliminating them elsewhere
6913280 people with mental illness are a growing part of new yorks incarcerated population and we are grateful to the center for urban community services for bringing this foundation funded program into our correctional system in addition to providing critical assistance for mentally ill inmates to cope with life in prison wellness self management will help them prepare for life in the community afterwards a transition that is tough even for offenders without mental illness
6913281 tenho a ilus o de jogar na premier o chelsea tem um grande plantel uma grande equipa e fez me uma boa oferta a mim e ao real madrid n o tenho nada contra a minha actual equipa ao que estou muito agradecido mas neste momento o meu objectivo sair daqui
6913282 dcjs is committed to providing our law enforcement partners across the state with training and education to enhance their knowledge and skills so they can better serve their communities
6913283 we rely on police officers and sheriffs deputies to help ensure the integrity of our sex offender management system and the accuracy of the information on the states sex offender registry im pleased that we could join with the chiefs and sheriffs associations to offer this important training
6913284 the safety of our communities and our correctional facilities depends on well trained dedicated correction officers
6913285 this exam is the starting point for an exciting career for the men and women of new york
6913286 well being of our people and customers is vital for sustainable economic growth
6913287 seriously this is a major problem but not atypical of the city of la we have some of the most
6913288 why didnt they reveal initially that they were going to price these units at 500 000 because they didnt know they were going to have to price them that low if it looks like a price cut and it smells like a price cut it must be still a ridiculously overpriced piece of faux americana ha i made a pun
6913289 curbed do you know if theres any kind of law in the city about
6913290 daily fodder in the debate over which candidate would do a better job as president
6913291 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6913292 could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6913293 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6913294 when you probe when you ask people whats bothering you about the economy right now in economic downturns problems paying for health care and health insurance really loom large
6913295 after peoples fixations paying for gas prices problems paying for health care are right at the top with job issues
6913296 idea of a health care market or nonmarket entirely run by the government
6913297 liberals support single payer aka medicare for all because it would eliminate the profit motive which by their lights is the reason americans are uninsured
6913298 takes a more moderate campaign line though we suppose just about everything is moderate compared to a total government takeover
6913299 obamas health care plan includes a taxpayer funded insurance program much like medicare but open to everyone
6913300 displace current private coverage and switch people to the default government option
6913301 with good reason critics often call this a back door route to a centrally planned health care bureaucracy
6913302 for all his lawyerly qualifications mr obama has essentially admitted that his proposal is really the front door
6913303 often imitated copied pasted and stolen from but never duplicated
6913304 this is a freaking great deal an architectural in silver lake for 700k with views etc is unheard of
6913305 maybe the rational price is 625 000 or maybe 575 000
6913306 i disagree with sammy hagar i think theres obviously more than one way to rock
6913307 watching a friend play fiddle as part of his cajun band at the ypsi heritage fest
6913308 either at my place or at the grotto passenger side toward the back grrrr
6913309 so i hear that isaac hayes is now with xenu rip isaac
6913310 because that is the distance that is in conjunction with other codes
6913311 for instance the legal code for selling of drugs near a school or sex offenders is 1 000 feet so it is a typical distance
6913312 as far as the county is concerned they seem to have met the letter of the ordinance as its currently crafted

6913503 cuomo was run over in his haste to get a settlement by these major firms
6913504 i think its outrageous that the firms are going to wait two years to deal with the liquidity for institutional investors
6913505 these are companies that have to make payroll that have to make investments some of the companies can be out of business by then
6913506 all the firms will be shamed or forced to do something even goldman which seems to be saying that all of their clients are rich and sophisticated

6913543 n o tem como negar que vencer o botafogo vai nos deixar com a moral muito elevada no restante do segundo turno mas todos temos a consci ncia de que para derrota los necess rio muita garra nossa id ia entrar em campo com mais vontade do que eles
6913544 como treinador n o temos a possibilidade m nima de uma defesa o quarto rbitro relatou coisas que n o aconteceram abrindo uma possibilidade maior de sofrer uma puni o t nhamos um microfone de tv que n o registrou nada pessoas que estavam perto e n o ouviram nada e ele diz que ouviu
6913545 i think its time for a measured and careful reaction
6913546 take a careful look at all of our policies and procedures and strategies to ensure schools are safe
6913547 i think thats a conversation we need to have as a community and as a school district about what are the types of strategies we want to put in place
6913548 metal detectors help to some degree but there are no guarantees
6913549 when it comes to child protection and keeping our kids safe whether its in church or in school is there is never a finish line you always work to get better
6913550 if theres anything positive that can come out of it it makes all of us in education stop and take a breath and say now are we prepared for that
6913551 ideally wed like to have an sro officer at the high school full time and then have one shared time at the middle school and high school but thats a funding issue
6913552 posso dizer com certeza de que esse cl ssico ser muito mais complicada do que o palmeiras isso tudo pelo crescimento do botafogo eles est o muito bem e temos de fazer de tudo para derrot los certamente se conseguirmos esse triunfo podemos afastar de vez esse perigo de rebaixamento

6913607 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6913608 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided
6913609 its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6913610 the commentary tells me that rates are on hold until they see some blue skies through this financial storm
6913611 dan paso a la estabilizaci n en ciudades como bogot medell n cali cartagena y bucaramanga

6913613 plantear soluciones para reducir el consumo de energ a y manejarlo eficientemente o c mo producir combustible limpio parec an temas de ciencia ficci n
6913614 si hoy se requieren caracter sticas especiales a la hora de edificar con estos est ndares imag nese qu suced a en ese entonces de hecho cuando los constructores evaluaban la posibilidad de hacer algo m s o menos parecido casi siempre encontraban que deb an regirse por estrictas especificaciones en las reas comunes o en los cuartos de administraci n o que deb an cumplir est ndares internacionales y adaptarse a topolog as climas etc
6913615 lo que llama la atenci n es que actualmente a la hora de las cuentas no se trata de un problema de grandes inversiones y hace diez o doce a os la situaci n tampoco era diferente
6913616 hay que romper esquemas y dejar de lado el modus operandi obsoleto por cierto de un edificio tradicional donde cada sistema redes de servicios voz datos telefon a entre otros se maneja de forma independiente
6913617 con la arquitectura verde no sucede esto pues se utiliza una sola cuadrilla un solo material y por lo tanto una sola ejecuci n
6913618 se reporta un gasto nico que al ser generado en un solo paquete produce ahorros de paso para el mantenimiento la adecuaci n de redes o las eventuales actualizaciones solo hay que acudir a un proveedor lo que igualmente significa menos gastos y m s garant a
6913619 por el contrario es todo un concepto que integra el dise o f sico del proyecto su ubicaci n el manejo de la electricidad del agua etc con tecnolog as de ltima generaci n que busca la sostenibilidad y por a adidura el cuidado ambiental y el ahorro de energ a entre otros aspectos ya sea en viviendas oficinas o proyectos industriales

6913631 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
6913632 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
6913633 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
6913634 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
6913635 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
6913636 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in

6913658 no that is not true we have not pulled out of the champions trophy but we have advised the icc about our considerable concern and we have made sure that they understand that we will not go anywhere which is not safe we are waiting to hear from them later this evening
6913659 ca at this stage hasnt made any official decision to not tour we are waiting to hear from icc the ball is in their court
6913660 we are very willing to tour pakistan we are very keen to do so and we will visit pakistan as long as the safety and security advisors say that it is safe
6913661 the only issue that is important for us is the safety and security of the players and the advice we get from our range of sources
6913662 we are aware of south africas decision but we will comment only after discussing various aspects of the issue during the icc board teleconference on sunday
6913663 we are deeply disappointed and when a decision was to be made on sunday we think south africa made a hasty choice
6913664 now its up to the icc to take a decision but i would say south africas refusal will badly hurt the event we will still do our best to save the event and host it on schedule
6913665 after extensive discussions and frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6913666 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6913667 we appreciate all the efforts of the icc task team the pcb the pakistan authorities and the security consultants
6913668 the players are naturally disappointed for their fans and the people of pakistan that they will not have a chance to see them in action in that country in september
6913669 our board is meeting with the icc on friday and i will be present at that meeting to convey our concerns
6913670 we have taken note of various security assessment reports including one from the federation of international cricketers associations fica nicholls steyn the icc consultants and another by our own government
6913671 i have also been in constant touch with our players in england over this and the mood among them is that the concerns remain
6913672 you cant rule out the possibility of a cancellation considering the absolute lack of a consensus at this stage
6913673 if countries like australia pull out there is no question of the tournament going ahead with substitutes like bangladesh
6913674 obviously ess wants the best teams to participate and ensure a world class tournament
6913675 it is possible to ensure quality coverage if it is shifted to a nearby country even now but it will involve significant extra costs for the broadcaster
6913676 we are still fighting and are hopeful of hosting the tournament

6913693 weve had a number of recessions in this country in fact we had a great depression we had world wars and throughout the genius of the american economy our emphasis on a meritocracy and a market system and a rule of law has enabled generation after generation to live better than their parents did and i mean most of the people in this room practically all of them last night lived better than john d rockefeller lived i mean all kinds of things have happened and in the 20th century alone the standard of living of the average american went up seven for one theres never been a period like it in history and thats not an accident its because we unleash human potential and will continue to do that in the future

6913708 this is a guy who lives in my neighborhood whos a professor of english in chicago who i know and who i have not received some official endorsement from hes not somebody who i exchange ideas from on a regular basis
6913709 and the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was 8 years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense george
6913710 so this kind of game in which anybody who i know regardless of how flimsy the relationship is is somehow somehow their ideas could be attributed to me i think the american people are smarter than that theyre not going to suggest somehow that that is reflective of my views because it obviously isnt

6913768 they diagnosed me with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis and insufficiency
6913769 when i was 17 they had said it was time to intervene which basically i had a couple of options but surgery was necessary the valve was not going to continue on its own
6913770 when i came out of surgery there were basically two things they told me i couldnt do that was drive a nascar and go skydiving which skydiving would be fun but i can live without it
6913771 the day i sent out the email here i dont think i got a lot of work done that afternoon a lot of people stopping by and they were just in complete amazement
6913772 its not just parents and grandparents that can have these issues its from birth to old age i mean everybody can have it and i dont think that a lot of people know that or understand that
6913773 it has been a tough summer weve had some pretty major rain events along the trial one here in rochford that happened in july pretty much just took the trail right out
6913774 we had to build the base back up so we had to put some pretty big rocks back in there and build it up and once it got built up then we had to put the limestone surface on it makes it easier to bike on and stuff
6913775 one day i just decided to come to rochford to make one of my rochford runs and when i got to the deerfield turnoff they were directing me toward the pavement and i did get to see the washout and it was very tragic
6913776 its only a short part of the trail its very scenic in there but the forest service and the trail system do a very good job about keeping the trail in shape so when the washouts do come theyre very rapid in repairing things
6913777 weve always gotten lots of compliments from people that come here just to ride the trail so we try to keep it at a pretty high standard of maintenance keep those people coming back
6913778 i know what you want to talk about but i really dont want to comment about it
6913779 i was told i have to keep it plugged in all the time so thats about it

6913783 we have some basic disagreements with the judge on the interpretation of the constitutionality the statutes and case law
6913784 well were delighted with the result obviously we think judge wilburs decision was right on the money
6913785 the principle thats at issue here is really pretty significant if the public policy of the state of south dakota is that private citizens can start lawsuits and get the school districts or the counties to pay their fees for them im not sure thats good public policy
6913786 it just handcuffs school districts in terms of their effort to ensure their students theres adequate funding
6913787 even within one or two months of the program we saw a tremendous amount of ability to get along with kids
6913788 being able to be familiar with a book being able to hold a book and to read tell a story that they really like and have been read to several times
6913789 we need to get these kids a very early age 3 4 5 to make a difference in their lives ready to learn
6913790 those 145 kids are going to be adults someday and maybe our kids in the working field were going to see that we made a difference

6913832 up to now the slightest criticism of radical islam on campus has been slammed as islamophobia while muslim groups and their radical fellow travelers have been allowed to say the most hateful things imaginable about christians and jews without any reaction from university administrators whatsoever
6913833 provost nikias has called the hadith on the msa website for what it is despicable given the atmosphere that prevails on most campuses today it was an act of integrity on his part to make this call and to demand that the msa live up to basic standards of civility that should govern the university
6913834 abu huraira reported allahs messenger may peace be upon him as saying the last hour would not come unless the muslims will fight against the jews and the muslims would kill them until the jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say muslim or the servant of allah there is a jew behind me come and kill him
6913835 the passage you cited is truly despicable and i share your concerns about its being on the usc server we did some investigations and i have ordered the passage removed
6913836 the passage in the hadith that you brought to our attention violates the usc principles of community and it has no place on a usc server
6913837 no one has the right to denigrate another human being on the basis of race sex sexual orientation national origin etc we will not tolerate verbal or written abuse threats harassment intimidation or violence against person or property

6913849 i also wish to inform the nation that national mourning starts today and will be for seven days
6913850 a former lawyer mwanawasa was regarded as one of the africas most progressive leaders
6913851 his efforts to tackle corruption helped win zambia widespread debt relief
6913852 beyond zambia he became best known as a vocal and rare african critic of the zimbabwean president robert mugabe leading to strained relations between the southern african neighbors
6913853 a crowd clapped and cheered as president levy mwanawasa rose from the water in an outdoor baptistery behind a baptist seminary chapel building in lusaka zambias capital
6913854 this baptism was an incredible occasion for the baptist witness to many people who we have not had in church before
6913855 it was the hallmark moment of anybodys life it was fantastic ashley came running out and sophia was bouncing along behind her
6913856 a lot of people prayed my family has been praying along with tea h and joseph we thank god for this
6913857 we really want to be back at home in our own environment christian wants to be back amongst friends getting some normality back into his life
6913858 in some ways its about breaking the apron strings of the rehabilitation process and getting fully out into the real world so there is a little bit of nervousness but he needs to go home
6913859 we cant wait to get back home and be able to enjoy country life again on our small lifestyle block
6913860 although it took some persuasion he loved it and is keen to go swimming again today
6913861 we take a lot of strength from the support weve received from the community and the motocross community
6913862 we expect it will be a pretty tough time emotionally for him were excited to have him back hes got a lot of friends here who have kept in touch with him
6913863 mr hoge suffered multiple injuries during the accident however he is progressing according to plans
6913864 the committee is finding at the moment that theres scope to improve our rates both through improved coordination of clinical practices and improving the way in which families come to these decisions
6913865 but its very early days yet to determine whether we have a system of presumed content or not
6913866 canada belgi en nederland de belangrijkste producerende landen van ecstasy zijn die de wereldhandel in deze drug bevoorraden
6913867 we hebben kennis genomen van robinhos uitlatingen en betreuren dit ten zeerste we zullen nooit een speler tegen zijn zin bij de club houden en hebben daarom besloten in te gaan op zijn wens om te vertrekken
6913868 the reason for allowing the order to lapse is that i dont think it is necessary to create additional special categories or special rights
6913869 we are firmly and strongly committed to fair treatment of all of our people and certainly dont condone discrimination in any form
6913870 but ive respected the process from day one and i want to continue to do that today and allow any details about the process and final decisions to be made by senator obama and their campaign not by anybody else
6913871 i am not in that arena this is his decision and i respect him to make it however he thinks is best for him and the country
6913872 i voted for the 87 billion before i voted against it
6913873 that guys a straight shooter if i wasnt so busy bowling and working and fishing and if i had time to spend on these issues i bet id come to the same conclusions that that guy would
6913874 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6913875 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6913876 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6913877 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6913878 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
6913879 its a lot more fun when youre not hitting out of the trees and chipping out sideways
6913880 i need to go out saturday and have a good day and shoot 6 or 7 under
6913881 i tried hard but struggled to focus this afternoon it really is a knockdown after the last couple of weeks
6913882 they were smooth they still held fairly well but you could tell that they are going to get firm
6913883 ive got two tournaments going on within one thats basically what i feel like
6913884 im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible i feel a little more pressure
6913885 youve got to drive the ball well and shape it both ways and make sure that your short game is in shape because its quite difficult around the greens
6913886 i had to hit every bit of a 3 iron in there
6913887 this is a great golf course this is one of the best courses weve played all year for sure
6913888 i was on vacation last week down at a lake and let it grow and got back and i thought hey its playoff time maybe ill just keep it
6913889 its a hockey thing in hockey guys grow the beards so i thought i would give it a shot and see if it works
6913890 i actually did vote for the 87 billion before i voted against it
6913891 i actually voted for the 87 billion dollars before i voted against it
6913892 i like our odds were 50 percent right now over here we have four people playing two bulldogs
6913893 adams playing really well and if i can get by danny lee its going to get interesting
6913894 its fun to have your football team win but it would be really cool to have a georgia bulldog win the u s am
6913895 i told my dad i was going to land it just short and it was going to take one hop and roll right to it
6913896 i started hitting my irons a little better had chances to make birdie putts and kept having to make him beat me with birdie putts rather than always having to scramble to get up and down
6913897 maybe ive just got to keep playing well and dont play those holes
6913898 i need to play well this week and next week and so far this week ive done that
6913899 if nick then feels i am worthy of a pick so be it if not then thats acceptable
6913900 i was just very relaxed out there with the boys sons tyrone and conor here ive got to be on my best behavior and my attitude is just pretty good
6913901 ive taken a lot of pressure off myself and feel comfortable ive been playing well and im in a good position now
6913902 i was at the open but my two best majors got me out of that tight pack
6913903 its exciting to see how the team is going to shape up and i am starting to get the tingle i am really excited about it and i think we are going to have a good time over there
6913904 im taking the next three weeks off to get fresh and ready i hope
6913905 i like attention i love men i like the glam outfits and the role playing i love being able to go nude in front of strangers i want them to enjoy my body i like to make men laugh in clubs i like to talk to them at stage side when theyre watching me dance
6913906 i hope that every guy who sees these pictures messes himself i hope they shoot out big

6913919 i have no idea how they are going play well just have to see
6913920 how well we play in the box early will determine our success

6913932 mitochondrial loci are generally a more sensitive indicator of population structure than are nuclear loci
6913933 mtdna patterns will prove to be robust indicators of population history and species limits
6913934 quantitative estimates of rates of population growth and values of gene flow
6913935 birdstrikes are a serious safety hazard and a major expense for the industry
6913936 a combination of morphological and molecular methods such as dna barcoding for efficient cost effective birdstrike identifications
6913937 increased effort to sequence morphological costesia spp from a broad geographical range enabling the regular testing of species hypotheses and the incorporation of all life stages using a single character set
6913938 bi directional sequences of at least 500 base pairs from the approved barcode region of coi containing no ambiguous sites links to electropherogram trace files available in the ncbi trace archive sequences for the forward and reverse pcr amplification species names that refer to documented names in a taxonomic publication or other documentation of the species concept used links to voucher specimens using the approved format of institutional acronym collection code catalog id number
6913939 the truth is that dna barcoding will not have any meaningful use for the general public and even when a portable barcoder becomes available it will not lead to any increase in the biological literacy of the man in the street
6913940 it is impossible to describe biological diversity with traditional approaches molecular methods are the way forward especially perhaps in the form of dna barcodes
6913941 highly conserved patterns of specificity to host taxa and host parts
6913942 diversity exceeding the original morphologic estimates by an order of magnitude
6913943 according to york biology professor laurence packer whos leading the groups efforts precisely 19 231 different kinds of bees have been identified but he thinks there might be another 5 000 or more species out there waiting
6913944 there are two reasons why bee species would benefit from a barcode name tag
6913945 most of the specimens in museums are not identified and the ones that are identified are only 60 to 70 percent correctly identified
6913946 i want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
6913947 this is his decision and i expect him to make it however he feels is best
6913948 obviously doesnt have a very clear sense of what ordinary americans are going through
6913949 maybe mccain thinks this economy is working for folks like him but how are things going for you
6913950 which is a fancy way of describing the page up and page down buttons
6913951 god may have created the world in six days but you can bet your ass that while he rested on the seventh day a programmer coded it all
6913952 oh were the only dealers in california who will have these in
6913953 can you give it to me out the door for 6000 today
6913954 if i come back tomorrow after i talk to my gf and get the youre telling me that you wont sell the bike for
6913955 sure this 350 helmet is better but the other one is good too if you want to save a few bucks
6913956 jesus i told you i didnt know dick about gear why the hell did you sell me this do i look like an astronaut to you
6913957 im living with my mom just till i get a few things worked out
6913958 i dont ride but im saving my money for a scooter
6913959 wifey take the eight bratty kids and go buy me them jimmy dean sausages
6913960 are you sure its not you thats uncomfortable i mean you did know that you would be working with women too when you went to nursing school
6913961 its a hell of a time not to have it its the worst 1000 metres i have put together in years
6913962 i dont know what to say im pretty speechless right now
6913963 it felt a little more like a final than the heat did thats for sure were not going to see fast times today but that is just the nature of the wind
6913964 to ensure that the event adequately reflects the priorities of the government and helps to achieve its domestic and international branding goals
6913965 these conditions will ensure that the department has appropriate input and oversight into vanocs ceremony planning
6913966 we just remind vanoc of course that the opening ceremonies are a time for all canadians to be included and to be celebrated as we present canada to the world
6913967 it speaks to the domestic and international priorities of the government
6913968 we have spent a tremendous amount of time with the government of canada understanding brand canada and what they are taking canada out to the world and to canadians as and were aligned with that
6913969 so i think it would be expected that the government of the day would have input with respect to how an olympic games occur on its own soil
6913970 so i would expect that their political platforms will be part and parcel of the opening ceremonies and anything that contradicts those policies i would see them probably rejecting
6913971 it is a very political event and it always has been
6913972 its not going to be carte blanche for the creative directors
6913973 the conservatives and everybody else would like to show canada as a happy shiny place like beijing has done for its facade as london will do in 2012
6913974 its just part and parcel of what the opening ceremonies are all about
6913975 they can certainly say well make it known that youve made conditions that were unacceptable or well simply scale down the size of the opening ceremony
6913976 and if people ask well say the canadian government was only willing to support it if they could have whatever they had in mind
6913977 if they had heard something they certainly would have pushed back
6913978 i think the word appropriate is key to what is meant there
6913979 theyre putting in half they would have a lot to say about what goes in
6913980 its unreasonable i would say that someone would give you 20 million blindly and say here go do whatever you want

6913992 were not ruling anything out were not ruling anything in the prime minister is reserving judgment until after he meets with opposition leaders
6913993 if he pulls the plug on the parliament without even having the members of the house come back to their seats and show what they can do then hes showing contempt for the democratic institutions and for the fact that canadians did not elect him to a majority government only to a minority
6913994 he will break the law he will break his word canadians will know how much he is not trustworthy

6914011 theres a large safe in there that we keep a little change in
6914012 he spent about six hours in there beating on that safe
6914013 i laugh at it because its kind of funny put that effort into it and then didnt get anything
6914014 our investigators are very well trained and well find this guy some way
6914015 the first issue is called the strangest teens of all and it takes place in the silver age just after x men 66
6914016 the second is called last hunts and massacres and it features a black costumed spidey still reeling from the events of kravens last hunt meeting up with the x men towards the end of the mutant massacre
6914017 the x men lineup changes but well see certain characters wolverine cyclops iceman storm more than once mario likes drawing storm in italian it turns out and shes called tempesta which i think is really cool
6914018 issue 1 pits our heroes against kraven the hunter and one of my favorites the blob and waitll you see marios rendition of these classic bad guys
6914019 issue 2 features all out war with sabretooth and the marauders issue 3 brings the menace of carnage and mr sinister who is a recurring figure as for 4 ill continue to play coy about that one
6914020 issue 1 is a bit more of a light hearted romp capturing the tone youd find in a silver age book issue 2 gets appropriately darker and grimmer given events in the characters lives at the time and the prevailing 80s ethic issue 3 reflects the tension and uncertainty of a time period which saw changes to many characters such as ben reilly taking on the role of spidey wolverine losing his adamantium claws and so forth
6914021 and to stay true to whats going on today issue 4 will be late im kidding kidding
6914022 it all comes together at the end in a way youll have to read the book to find out about
6914023 there wont be a lot of pete in these issues in fact he wont show up at all in issue 3 thats ben reilly all the way
6914024 but we do get some out of costume parker moments in 1 along with gwen stacy mary jane harry osborn and flash thompson as they and the original x men in their civilian clothes all wind up at the coffee bean and hijinks ensue
6914025 they have a similar outsiders perspective and are persecuted by authorities as opposed to heroes like the avengers who are respected and looked up to
6914026 but spidey is a loner whereas the x men are like a family and i think the x men see themselves as part of a larger cause the betterment of mutantkind whereas for spidey its more the power and responsibility thing the idea that one man can and should make a difference
6914027 i knew the first time i laid eyes on his art that the book would be visually stunning and it is but its surpassed my expectations the level of detail and the lush european flavor he brings is just amazing i think people will really be blown away what came as a surprise to me is how fast he is and his work ethic is unbelievable the research hes done into the time periods goes above and beyond the call of duty all that detail isnt just there to look pretty every line on the page exists to enhance the story i feel very privileged to be a part of his first big u s project
6914028 i have been working on comics since 1991 first in italy for the publisher sergio bonelli on the series nathan never and after for humanoides associ s a french publisher with my series morgana co written with luca enoch and kurt busieks redhand both sci fi stories
6914029 ive always been an avid reader of science fiction i have also recently released a ghost story for soleil mortemer written by val rie mangin
6914030 the thing came quite out of the blue for me i never seriously thought i could ever work on superheroes before and after getting in touch with marvel i simply asked it to be spider man as a teenager i was totally addicted to the character and actually drawing him is a kids dream come true
6914031 so besides working on some of the best known characters world wide which surely has its own appeal theres this thing about my love as a kid for the genre that really is coming back unexpectedly even more than i could imagine and it makes it one blast of an experience
6914032 so i think you can easily guess who spider man is to me
6914033 the issues in the mini will be based in different periods in time and the character changes and evolves so much
6914034 for me this is the most intriguing enjoyable and the most difficult thing to visualize and it has to be there not only when hes actually doing it but also when hes in plain clothes i have to admit i havent read much of spider man since i was a kid but im catching up so i cant say much but i guess this must be the hardest part for the writers too especially now that peter parker has grown up
6914035 not only for the visuals of the x men but for the whole background they move into im watching old movies reading or re reading comics to try and get the right feeling for each of the time periods researching fashion architecture theres so much that have changed through these years and it takes a lot but is one of the most rewarding things in the end
6914036 to get the feel of each team im trying to read as many back issues as i can theres no shortcut unfortunately you have to wait for that click when a character becomes real to get it right at least i did my best to plus i get to draw all the outfits no chance to get bored for sure
6914037 the style im using is really my usual if theres any such thing
6914038 even if i always try to understand how that particular story wants to be told and try to adjust my drawings accordingly i still remain myself within and that puts up some insurmountable and sometimes frustrating borders i think i can consider myself basically a mainstream european comic author and that may give some sense of news for the american readers that are mostly used to different things especially colors wise my recipe is green pencils markers sometimes graphite pencil photoshop lots of enthusiasm passion and a pinch of luck
6914039 but the thing that i love the most is that he really is capable of nailing a character with just one line everyone says what he she would have said and in that time frame kudos chris
6914040 i dont remember the exact chain of events but soon after i got handed the spidey books i was talking to former x editor andy schmidt about the art of mario alberti which we were both fans of and somewhere in there the idea of doing a team up mini we would co edit fell into place
6914041 chris then came up with a solid pitch for a story and next thing we knew andy left marvel somehow though the idea of spidey teaming up with the x men survived
6914042 mario is just flat out talented hes penciling inking and coloring this thing he would have lettered it too if i didnt stop him
6914043 so we all wanted something that would show him off to a relatively new american audience chris gage really did the heavy lifting and came in with a solid game plan for how to tell a big story showing off the histories of both spidey and the x guys chris knows both sets of characters really well and found a throughline that fits perfectly into established history
6914044 this is a labor of love for all of us especially steve who turns into a drooling fanboy whenever new pages come in im always a drooling fanboy so i just drool even more
6914045 if even a fraction of the fun were having working on this book comes across readers are in for a real treat
6914046 i wish to thank steve wacker for all his support and enthusiasm hes making my adventure at marvel the best
6914047 have fun reading it half as much as im having doing it should be enough already
6914048 when we were first asked to do speed racer the property it was incredible it was very exciting it was a film by the wachowski brothers and it was about car racing awesome thats going to make a great game
6914049 when you make a game based on a license you really are playing roulette you dont know how the film is going play out in the market
6914050 instead of running to try to help my son he ran from the scene
6914051 he left my son and grandson to burn to death
6914052 this is particularly an opportunity for wheeling jesuit students to prepare as scientists and engineers something they wouldnt have on their home campus
6914053 the psychic was fat in the old movie she should be young and hot in this one i recommend hayley duff or an unkown note actress does not have to actually be psychic
6914054 the closet explodes in a cloud of dust lightning and booming noises repeatedly the ghost comes out and is 50 feet tall with claws its the scariest monster anyone has ever seen ever
6914055 i spent days on the phone calling and i got so frustrated and so upset
6914056 at the most fundamental level it gives parents the opportunity to be knowledgeable
6914057 i dont want folks to think i rank low on the scale and be discouraged about that i think that this system gives the opportunities to improve and move up
6914058 i think it works to parents advantage because they get more information but it works to the centers advantage because they get to show off what good quality is
6914059 if its a rating where people could just get right to it and look across it would make it so much easier and youd feel a lot more comfortable with it
6914060 im happy i have a medal its not the one i want but im still happy
6914061 you have to learn how to lose thats how you grow and how you learn to do better the next time
6914062 it is a start but im very competitive when i want something i usually get it so im disappointed because i want my gold medal
6914063 its just a question of a little more training in various aspects and ill get it next time
6914064 ive loved every minute of it but at the same time this is a long season i feel that my little tired body is tired and wants to stop i knew i had one race left in me for sure and im happy its done
6914065 i have no explanation all i have is an apology i hate watching people apologize after bad performances but now i know why they do it because there was a lot of pressure on me
6914066 that pressure amounted to expectations of people back home and i always talk about how great performances by canadian athletes can be inspiring and motivating i didnt contribute to that at all friday
6914067 that wasnt our best display we can do better we can get under 38 seconds
6914068 we were a little too conservative needed to go for broke
6914069 i came here for the experience and learned a lot
6914070 this was for four years down the road in london
6914071 at the moment it was frustrating when i was dusting myself up but i was there and i learned a lot
6914072 i experienced so much for my first olympics so im just going take that on for the next one
6914073 the music and everything just comes along with the sport
6914074 its just exciting your heart is pumping its cool its extreme it helps get a new generation into the olympics
6914075 weve had a chance to watch all the other teams and many of them have had a chance to see ours they say it is amazing
6914076 at half i started to feel it at 35 kilometres i knew i was going to be struggling but i still wanted to finish physically and mentally this just takes everything out of you
6914077 it was really tight but i thought i had the victory the referees wont give any points theyre really tough
6914078 china was in our reach and we played a good game our team is young so its sure that our next objective is london 2012
6914079 technology changes very fast and our reliance on technology is growing at a phenomenal rate
6914080 it is a challenge for us to keep up which is all the more reason why we need to collaborate more and i think this report is an example of us doing it
6914081 as we move more and more to the internet and the technology being used the risks are increasing a lot of the public are not very careful about their identity
6914082 one of the reasons why organized crime has been as successful as it is is because they are very adaptable its not as if they have given up any of their traditional markets but as new technology and as changes occur in society they are also changing and taking advantage of the areas they can exploit
6914083 weve noticed over the past year that there are a lot of people involved in different companies who give information from the inside to organized crime members its not necessarily on the street level its more like companies government its almost everywhere
6914084 its a pretty new phenomena for us its a nationwide problem
6914085 we are asking all citizens to report all crimes all fraudulent transactions
6914086 the banks are changing their habits i think they now understand the importance of exchanging information and i would say we are building a good relationship with them everybody now understands that this is not only an individual matter it is a nationwide problem
6914087 she loves her family thats very important to me and shes a very good humanitarian i just think that shes very balanced since she had her son i think that in all aspects of her life shes been very grateful for the gift that she has and she shares with other people i just think thats great
6914088 my birthday was in june so he booked this trip because he knew celine was going to be here
6914089 she has such a beautiful voice its just so peaceful it seems to be so natural
6914090 when she opened up the olympics in atlanta i believe it was in 1996 thats what the co ordinator said we have the best female singer in the world she is the best no question

6914093 a war zone is not something youre usually hearing in wake forest north carolina
6914094 she wanted me to hold her because she was afraid of the gunfire
6914095 this is one of the those things we have to do
6914096 we have to have training and the training has to be realistic
6914097 they will hear some noise were not going to be able to quiet them completely
6914098 species like this displace native wildlife and they could wipe out those native species
6914099 again though i ask what do we do with these men and yes women who have served what
6914100 he punches me first and his friend who had nothing to do with it punches me
6914101 one of the stupidest things i ever did in my life
6914102 j t will be our starter going into the season
6914103 he has a good command of the offense hes played well in all three preseason games and its time to get ready for the season
6914104 he has played with consistency he did the things that are important i dont want to take anything away from alex and shaun but hes our best man for the job right now
6914105 without the white mans euros and dollars you amount to nothing
6914106 p den m de tilf jer vi radarbilledet en vigtig information
6914107 det er jo v sentlig vejrinformation om der er tordenvejr p vej eller ej
6914108 ja og dertil er vi jo kommet over et v sentligt problem tidligere havde vi ikke muligheden for at vise morgentemperaturen i skemaet n r vi udsendte aftenudsigten og skiftede skemaet fra i dag til i morgen det kan vi nu til geng ld for denne vigtige information har vi m tte flytte temperaturskalaen over i h jre side
6914109 at m lingerne fra r m ville v re stort set identiske med m lingerne fra brorfelde men vi fandt hurtig ud af at noget var galt
6914110 m lingerne fra brorfelde som vi kendte s godt viste sig at have nogle udsving som vi ikke s i de tilsvarende m linger fra r m
6914111 vi kontrollerer vores m linger for en r kke st jkilder og vi var ret hurtigt sikre p at her var ikke tale om en naturlig variation
6914112 da vi ydermere kunne konstatere at udsvingene fortrinsvis skete p hele klokkesl t og gik flere r tilbage s var vi klar over at vi skulle lede efter en menneskeskabt rsag

6914114 a kitten is chiefly remarkable for rushing about like mad at nothing whatever and generally stopping before it gets there
6914115 he was a kindhearted kid you know i just loved him you know what im saying he would do anything for you if you asked him
6914116 had nothing to do with being gang related or racially motivated
6914117 i think he probably stood his ground and that ultimately led to his death
6914118 he said i told ryan that someday that mouth of his is going to get him in trouble but i never thought a kid would pull a trigger and shoot him
6914119 the dude was slapping him and smacking him on the back of his hands
6914120 it was just something he had to do in this area to survive
6914121 he had this tough exterior but if you really knew him he was not like that at all
6914122 when people see a kid in baggy pants or baggy clothes they get the wrong perception of them
6914123 they think this is just a dumb guy in the projects but ryan was nothing like that at all even though he might be dressed like that he had a big heart
6914124 the warning signs that there was a culture that lacked discipline was there
6914125 i dont think anyone could have anticipated or would have anticipated a tragedy of this magnitude
6914126 but if there is a specific individual who is dead set on perpetrating a crime an act of violence on another individual which was the case in this situation theyre likely to find a way to do it
6914127 it is just ironic that that is where his life ended
6914128 were going through the process of settling the individual cases as if we have a global agreement
6914129 no amount of money can even begin to restore the shattered trust and stolen childhood
6914130 given six civil lawsuits and victims its hard to imagine how anyone would believe his alleged innocence at this point
6914131 hart perpetrated sexual abuse upon minors in the parishes he served additionally defendant hart engaged in inappropriate sexual and sexualized behaviors in front of the minor children allowed them to drink alcoholic beverages and made them witness to immoral and or illegal acts that he committed
6914132 and what pray tell would the other side of this story be
6914133 saddened by those who trust blindly wrote on aug 21 2008 9 53 pm
6914134 peggy im so sorry for what you amp your family have been thru
6914135 and to think how many people bowed and kissed his ring
6914136 we are deeply saddened by the news of this accident and the resulting loss of lives
6914137 while hes hanging there just fire spells at him like crazy
6914138 certainly weve done it with lord of the rings weve extended beyond the movies there we did it with james bond for a while i dont know what well do with harry potter itd be fun to i think theres more stories that we can tell
6914139 theres an opportunity to go back to the original movie
6914140 the technology has moved on so much when we were first making those games we were making it for playstation 1 and now weve got you know the wii i think theres opportunities to revisit stories
6914141 we have to figure out whether anyone wants to buy those or not
6914142 the reality is that were focused on the movie games
6914143 we do not sponsor partner much like we do with hundreds of web sites any site hosting copyrighted streaming content in this case they are not actually hosting the content we view services that dont actually host content as if they were a search engine in these instances the web publisher is not violating our terms today however obviously theres moves to be made here as an industry and as those change so will our terms
6914144 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
6914145 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6914146 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6914147 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6914148 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6914149 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6914150 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6914151 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6914152 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6914153 if you trust every web site but not a government
6914154 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official is it possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6914155 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6914156 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6914157 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6914158 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6914159 the threat was first reported by a south florida newspaper on thursday
6914160 biscayne boulevard at thirteenth street and angled so that it point ed directly at the miami heralds headquarters across the street
6914161 theres so many possibilities with this thing because what matters now is just the story you want to tell
6914162 do you have a good story to tell then you can do it because this thing isnt specific to the series you can tell any story with this interface because its entirely contextual
6914163 weve spent a lot of time working on the story this time weve worked with people from hollywood script writers to really make it just right and i think its a very unusual story for a videogame so i think people will be quite surprised
6914164 ive made 250 plate appearances for the last five or six years so thats what we were kind of shooting for
6914165 ill see one of my aunts in the face of one of the girls in class or ill see my uncle in the face of one of the little boys
6914166 i see what my aunts and uncles werent able to do
6914167 by the end of the year theyre walking really proud
6914168 id rather have them late than not come in at all
6914169 i love influencing the future now that im teaching pregnant girls im influencing two generations
6914170 were struggling to find a place where she can be kept under lock and key
6914171 we have to wait and see what the judge decides
6914172 im not ready to take that kind of money out of the county coffers if there are other options
6914173 i think she has shown from the day of her initial arrest to the day of her indictment that shes not a flight risk
6914174 you could turn a gym into a courtroom if you needed to
6914175 enjoyed photographing this monarch butterfly as it dined on the nectar of these flowers in our butterfly garden this afternoon
6914176 how to get your network hacked in 10 easy steps
6914177 if im in the mood which is most of the time it doesnt take much for a man to get into my pants
6914178 good hygiene and the guts to approach me is usually enough
6914179 oh and i like when a mans cock is already hard when i take it out
6914180 the u s claims that the missile defense system made up of 10 interceptor rockets in poland and a radar installation in the neighboring czech republic will be used to defend against attacks against the so called rogue states such as iran however the missile interceptors are effective only against short range ballistic missiles and there are no rogue states within short range of poland the russian border on the other hand is just 180 kilometers from the planned site of the installation
6914181 russia is prepared to supply syria with defensive weapons the russian foreign minister said on thursday following a meeting between the two countries leaders in russias black sea resort of sochi
6914182 they bring a knife to the fight we bring a kazoo
6914183 are you upset that you havent been vetted by obama to be vp
6914184 well first i never said i wanted that what i have always said is that ill do whatever it takes to see that obama becomes the next president of the united states
6914185 barack obama is too inexperienced too unqualified too untrustworthy and too dangerous to be potus
6914186 sealed away both from the rice paddies of indochina and from the outside world
6914187 did not share the disillusioning and morally jarring experiences of soldiers like john kerry jim webb and chuck hagel who found themselves unable to recognize their enemy in the confusion of the jungle
6914188 underwent the conversion that caused kerry for one to toss away some of his war decorations during a protest at the capitol
6914189 some happy news well i can now announce that partner tom starr and i are expecting a baby and we are very happy
6914190 criminal networks can profit by collecting e waste in developed countries such as canada and selling it to recyclers in developing nations
6914191 this practice is a violation of both canadian and international law
6914192 one of the reasons organized crime has been as successful as it is is that theyre very adaptable and its not like theyve given up any of their traditional markets
6914193 if it wasnt lucrative organized crime groups wouldnt be involved in it
6914194 were realizing that in terms of sales of laptops and electronic devices to organized crime there is often damage to the environment and its a national concern
6914195 canadian forests are vulnerable to illegal harvesting due to their relative abundance isolation and the large number of logging access roads
6914196 the illegal trade in wildlife can be as profitable as dealing in narcotics
6914197 we have in canada an abundant supply on the one hand of natural resources including fisheries and forestry
6914198 but we have all seen that overexploitation of natural resources can have dramatic effects
6914199 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6914200 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6914201 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6914202 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6914203 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
6914204 unfortunately this exceptional centre of biodiversity is in real danger as in many other regions of madagascar too deforestation activities slash and burn cultivation hunting and mining of mineral resources pose an enormous threat to the remaining forests and their inhabitants conservation activities are urgently needed to ensure the long term survival of these animals
6914205 this package is a powerful way of protecting the habitat of endangered species and ensuring their future protection
6914206 now that the reserve system is finalised we hope our state government will turn its attention and further resources to the other critical actions that need to be done to preserve this endangered species and all of the other forest species it shares its habitat with for future generations
6914207 the biggest threat for these and other endangered species is now climate change what these species need now is the protection of all old growth forests from woodchipping
6914208 forest protection against these threats will help secure their future its not just about protecting animals these areas are also our water supply catchments and carbon stores
6914209 the practical action by the victorian government to protect our faunal emblem offers a sensible approach to the management of species under fire and provides for the continuation of ecosystems that enable us to live such producing water oxygen rain and climate regulation
6914210 these new forest reserves are also critically important habitat for endangered animals like native owls fish and gliders our frogs inhabit healthy water catchments our ground and tree dwellers like the long footed potoroo and leadbeaters possum require multi aged forests that are still under threat from logging in eastern victoria
6914211 im going to have spike marks on my back this afternoon
6914212 i see no reason why the guys who are at 4 and 5 under wont shoot a low score today
6914213 i made some bad decisions and it cost me dearly i think i hit three shots that i wish i could hit again and unfortunately i had two doubles and a bogey
6914214 sure i would have liked to play better but i wasnt trying to make doubles i was trying to make birdies
6914215 i did a self lobotomy there a couple times i think i made some silly choices and so be it i played some good golf in between
6914216 its just nice to be on the right side of the cut
6914217 its just nice to be playing on the weekend itll be nice to be playing somewhere near the end of the draw ive been in this position a couple of times this year and i did okay but not great
6914218 you try not to think about it but you know the number you have to get to
6914219 we analyze the data on an ongoing basis and theres no two ways about it he adds value to the product
6914220 youre in a media environment that is crowded with millions of messages

6914225 goviex has promising exploration property in a region with a long history of uranium mining and has assembled an exceptional technical team with decades of experience in niger
6914226 all were asking is just to have a little share
6914227 it certainly is our hope that its not a long strike
6914228 but how long the strike will last really is up to the union weve been pretty clear the offer we put on the table is our best offer
6914229 the profits are just the highest that theyve ever been
6914230 miners are average working class folks who are coaches in the hockey rinks and who have kids in schools and who contribute in a significant way to their communities
6914231 its appropriate in times of prosperity to share with those people whose work and labour is delivering those profits to those corporations
6914232 weve lost a lot of members over the years i think we should be well paid for what we do
6914233 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6914234 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6914235 everything you need could be right in front of you
6914236 whens the last time you said hello to a stranger on the street
6914237 dont talk down to me your head is moving side to side
6914238 im bringing up the past to put it all to rest
6914239 i cant escape the tears one for every broken bone
6914240 que el amor no es una certeza sino una hip tesis a comprobar
6914241 i like our odds were 50 percent right now over here we have four people playing two bulldogs
6914242 adams playing really well and if i can get by danny lee its going to get interesting
6914243 its fun to have your football team win but it would be really cool to have a georgia bulldog win the u s am
6914244 i told my dad i was going to land it just short and it was going to take one hop and roll right to it
6914245 i started hitting my irons a little better had chances to make birdie putts and kept having to make him beat me with birdie putts rather than always having to scramble to get up and down
6914246 maybe ive just got to keep playing well and dont play those holes
6914247 bogeys definitely should have been avoided and i definitely didnt handle those parts very well
6914248 im going to try to play as good as i can and try to make the decision easy for him said mahan who is 13th in the standings and has apologized and tried to distance himself from some inflammatory comments he made several weeks ago
6914249 you know ive just got to play this week for this week
6914250 i just tried to play today for today he said
6914251 i mean i really was comfortable with my game and i just couldnt get anything going i made a bogey and then made a birdie and then made another bogey i never got under par today not once just couldnt get over the hump
6914252 when you shoot 62 its so clean and easy and i didnt have much stress yesterday mahan said
6914253 ive won coming from three back so i just need to kind of hang around tomorrow and shoot a good round and hopefully come the back nine sunday thats kind of where it all happens
6914254 but im ecstatic im in a good position and hopefully i can go out there and open up and make a few birdies early and kind of put it on cruise control
6914255 its just the guy who gets hot thats who they are favoring it to the guy who gets hot i hope it turns out the way it did this summer when perry won three tournaments in a six week stretch thats kind of the way im going to have to play these three weeks like i did those six weeks in the summer
6914256 some weeks things go against you so im not going to worry about it he said
6914257 i certainly had my chances the last few holes he said
6914258 im going to take it reasonably easy the next six days he said noting he would probably go to the course monday
6914259 im going to relax and do things at a nice quiet pace
6914260 but a good round tomorrow can get me back in it for sunday which is the goal
6914261 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6914262 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6914263 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6914264 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6914265 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
6914266 its a lot more fun when youre not hitting out of the trees and chipping out sideways
6914267 i need to go out saturday and have a good day and shoot 6 or 7 under
6914268 all of the good feelings that i had last year at westchester basically they are there but as far as it relates to the course they are gone because we are at a different venue
6914269 i was on vacation last week down at a lake and let it grow and got back and i thought hey its playoffs time maybe ill just keep it its a hockey thing in hockey guys grow the beards so thought i would give it a shot and see if it works
6914270 tiger said something to me after i won it the second time and he was dead serious
6914271 i havent played a round that well in a long time
6914272 my scores have been okay but i really felt like i played some good golf so im very excited
6914273 ive got two tournaments going on within one thats basically what i feel like that ryder cup is there a couple of weeks away when paul azinger makes that decision and im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible i want to make that team and i want to be on there
6914274 obviously for me its something that ive loved my whole life playing soccer as a good spaniard i might say its every kids dream growing up in spain so i like to stay in touch with it
6914275 and it helps me disconnect from golf which is what you have to do in some of those week offs so when im playing tennis or soccer or something like that i mean theres not a chance theres one thought about golf at that moment and thats what i love about it
6914276 well obviously we all like to score but no i probably prefer passing the ball
6914277 i try to score once in awhile when i have a good chance but you know a good pass always makes you feel good
6914278 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6914279 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6914280 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6914281 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6914282 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
6914283 its a lot more fun when youre not hitting out of the trees and chipping out sideways
6914284 i need to go out saturday and have a good day and shoot 6 or 7 under
6914285 i tried hard but struggled to focus this afternoon it really is a knockdown after the last couple of weeks
6914286 they were smooth they still held fairly well but you could tell that they are going to get firm
6914287 ive got two tournaments going on within one thats basically what i feel like
6914288 im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible i feel a little more pressure
6914289 youve got to drive the ball well and shape it both ways and make sure that your short game is in shape because its quite difficult around the greens
6914290 i had to hit every bit of a 3 iron in there
6914291 this is a great golf course this is one of the best courses weve played all year for sure
6914292 i was on vacation last week down at a lake and let it grow and got back and i thought hey its playoff time maybe ill just keep it
6914293 its a hockey thing in hockey guys grow the beards so i thought i would give it a shot and see if it works
6914294 from what jesus christ is in regard to us we must conclude as st
6914295 what i say in an absolute sense of our lord i say in a relative sense of our blessed lady
6914296 all that belongs to god by nature belongs to mary by grace
6914297 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6914298 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6914299 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6914300 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6914301 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6914302 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6914303 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6914304 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6914305 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6914306 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6914307 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6914308 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6914309 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6914310 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6914311 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
6914312 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6914313 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6914314 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6914315 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6914316 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6914317 i dont suffer from mental instability i enjoy every minute of it

6914320 kj noons versus nick diaz is definitely not happening on oct 4
6914321 i still believe kj noons is a man of honor he comes from a great family a fighting family hes a great kid hes a great athlete i think hes just being mismanaged right now
6914322 but its also the managers responsibility to get his fighter to take the right fights that lead him to financial gains and its up to the manager to make sure that he has the fighter understand how elitexc feels about him otherwise the manager is painting whatever picture he wants to paint and in this case this manager his 15 minutes of fame is costing his client his career
6914323 i dont really have to say much because mark dion said pretty much everything for me
6914324 in fact i wish just saying hi would make mark dion have his press conference i will be the first one there in the first row because i need a good laugh theres not many good sit coms on anymore and i need a good half hour laugh
6914325 so according to mark the opportunity to be on cbs doesnt help him does it
6914326 then mark needs to tell that to the winners of american idol or survivor or even the losers of those shows who have all blasted into the stratosphere
6914327 he needs to say that to any competitor or athlete who has had an opportunity to be showcased on national television you think michael phelps would be on sports illustrated on wheaties boxes would be the no 1 google search you think that would happen if he didnt have the platform of network television to be showcased on he would just be another swimmer winning awards
6914328 it doesnt extend for fights it just extends for time with that and time off for injury following the first nick diaz fight pull up that chair if youre not willing to fight
6914329 i think mark dion owes an apology to eddie alvarez
6914330 i think he owes an apology to every human being out there at this point
6914331 you want to say eddie alvarez is the no 1 contender fine do i think eddie alvarez is a great fighter one hundred percent do i think hes worthy of a title challenge one hundred percent does he make great fights one hundred percent
6914332 unfortunately eddie is not available at this time due to recovering from an injury and also due to the fact that he is getting married and he is going on a honeymoon sorry mark dion it doesnt take five to 10 minutes it takes five to 10 days and sometimes it takes longer than that
6914333 its marital bliss and the guy deserves that its a once in a lifetime opportunity and your selfish ass is not going to get in the way of that
6914334 i dont think youre scared of nick diaz i would like you to prove that to the world that you are the champion that we believe you are
6914335 elitexc 100 percent believes that you can win this fight we 100 percent believe nick diaz can win the fight we 100 percent believe that together you make a spectacular fight
6914336 kj noons please wake up and smell that beautiful hawaiian coffee we want you to fight we believe in you believe in yourself and defend this belt

6914363 the resurrection must correspond with the death if the one be figurative so may the other but if the death be literal as we have admitted to be the case with both the martyr companies in this vision then must the resurrection be the same
6914364 a resurrection ought to be of the same character with the death from which it is a revival but huss death was literal and personal therefore it must have been his own literal and bodily resurrection which he anticipated on the eve of his death

6914444 in addition to the sirens we alert all in our area through the cable television channels that weather conditions are scary and viewers need to be alert the reverse 911 system is a great tool and i hope everyone will go to the city of del rio web site at www cityofdelrio com and click on the code red i con for instructions the reverse 911 system allows a person to enter their phone number into the system and if impending dangerous storms are in the area the system calls that person to alert them

6914464 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
6914465 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

6914467 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
6914468 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
6914469 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
6914470 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
6914471 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
6914472 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
6914473 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
6914474 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
6914475 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
6914476 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
6914477 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs

6914509 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat

6914615 it is important because what is happening diseases in neighbouring countries can move quickly to singapore it is a good idea to haveyour protection offshore and help other countries
6914616 when one talks about zero tolerance its effectively saying no you feel a country may not be able to safely send you food that is zero tolerance but if youre reliant on food for imports youve got to look further than that and increase your source of supply
6914617 the way to do this is to use a science basis for making decisions on imports it doesnt mean your standards of food safety decrease in fact because youre being scientific the food safety risk minimises
6914618 if you want to manage risk you need to think about the sources of introduction of disease and one source could be neighbouring countries and if theres difference with respect to the efficiency or the veterinary service its actually quite useful rather than build up a fortress for singapore where you have a big wall around you
6914619 a key initiative that we see as important is developing intelligence networks within the region and globally on food safety animal and plant health issues so that all this data can be brought together to enable improved analysis of risk and this will enhance food safety and biosecurity in singapore
6914620 the bears that had been on that last bit of ice that remained over shallow shelf waters are now swimming either toward land or toward the rest of the sea ice which is a considerable distance north
6914621 we have some observations of bears swimming into shore when the sea ice was not visible on the horizon
6914622 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
6914623 polar bears can swim quite well but they are not aquatic animals

6914646 and if theres a hillary supporter whos not for obama i would say this is the democratic party and we are together

6914675 protecting the bowhead whales of niginganiq has been a 26 year marathon effort
6914676 we are grateful to the people of clyde river for their patience and persistence and we thank minister baird and environment canada for their dedication and commitment in putting this finally over the finish line
6914677 from the very beginning in 1982 wwf canada has been working with the local hunters and trappers organization and hamlet council to protect this important bowhead whale feeding ground
6914678 this is an excellent example of an inuit led and inuit championed effort to protect the environment of a threatened species brought to the brink of extinction by non aboriginal commercial whalers we applaud their determination to preserving their natural heritage on behalf of all canadians

6914690 venue has had a tremendous impact on the way we work
6914691 its streamlined my workflow greatly reduced our setup time and dramatically lessened the amount of equipment we carry more to the point its improved our sound quality
6914692 with the dramatic improvements in the quality of recorded music over the past 20 years fans have become far more sophisticated and their listening expectations are considerably higher
6914693 in addition internet based technologies such as itunes have created a level of consumer immediacy and a desire on behalf of artists and management to capture high quality live recordings for fast delivery to their eager fans the venue systems ability to combine live sound mixing with industry standard recording and production tools such as pro tools recording software is enabling engineers and musicians to meet the increasingly sophisticated demands of their listeners
6914694 its only through great advances in audio technology like pro tools that its now possible to achieve in real time a level of sound quality worthy of a live webcast like this one digidesign has enabled todays artists and productions to bring studio quality sound to live performance and to the internet
6914695 in this difficult credit market we are extremely pleased with the confidence and support demonstrated by our lenders
6914696 along with other available funds we intend to use this additional availability to fund our expansion plans acquisitions share buyback program and other general corporate purposes
6914697 mengold is very pleased to be renewing its relationship with mineralfields group
6914698 this is an important milestone in the growth of mengold and we look forward to working with mineralfields group as we develop our holdings
6914699 im more aware now of the inadequacy of political systems to solve the worlds problems
6914700 and therefore less hopeful that the whole world hinges on one candidate or another or one particular party i see the churchs role in the political arena as being more of a voice of challenge to all civic leaders to focus on what matters
6914701 that will mean calling them to the historically conservative pursuits of preservation of unborn life and fiscal conservativism
6914702 additionally we must call them to historically liberal challenges such as helping the poor ending racism and protecting the environment we need to express to our leaders that these pursuits are not contradictory but represent a vast majority of voting christians in america
6914703 if people will actually sit down and talk to each other
6914704 theyll find they have a lot more in common than they think they do
6914705 later this evening there will be a moment when the presumptive u s presidential candidates sit together with the evangelical preacher rick warren in his 23 000 member saddleback church in orange county calif
6914706 warren who has emerged as a leading voice and as an arbiter of public virtue and religious responsibility in our country will sit individually with the politicians and ask them about their moral center this will not be a tabloid expose as warren promises but rather a nuanced discussion about the future of our world that hinges on individual responsibility morality and sense of justice these questions of behavior morals and policy are not issues of left or right not national or international they are not political issues to be solved in the next election the decay of a sphere of ethics is all consuming and may result in either blind obedience to a totalitarian way or a throwing up of our hands in disgust and walking away from the events that affect our lives
6914707 shed old labels and methods in order to win an audience with people who need what god has to offer
6914708 challenged me to be a voice of truth to the culture while building bridges of friendship with all people in our community
6914709 but all races and the aged and those with special needs we need to stand for all life i want to make sure that the poor and helpless are given hope in our nation i feel that we should care about our environment and work to preserve gods creation thats just as biblical and worth my attention sadly many christians who have been labeled conservatives have given the impression that these issues dont matter
6914710 the company is very lean and we have not been backfilling when people leave in certain areas
6914711 we are continuing to do everything in our power to keep our costs as low as possible
6914712 neither major party wants to admit that the mining boom is heading into trouble and labor wants to avoid an election later in the year or early next year
6914713 we also want to ask why wa is doing so little about climate change
6914714 we should be the solar energy showpiece for the world but labor is building two giant coal burning power stations with plans for two more
6914715 the gas facility at varanus island was managed using safety case methodology derived straight from the nuclear industry
6914716 its bad enough that the state is suffering the gas shortages caused by that explosion this year heaven help us if it was a nuclear plant
6914717 the business pages of the west australian are full of mining companies announcing their plans for ripping the heart out of the kimberley region
6914718 suddenly the government has started talking about aboriginal communities as being unviable
6914719 all those who want to live in a healthy equal society should vote for the socialist alliance
6914720 the socialist alliance shares the ideology i fought for all my life people before profit and for peoples right to have a better future
6914721 by standing for election as a socialist alliance candidate we will open the door for other political refugees to participate fully in australian political life as australian citizens
6914722 as a migrant or as a refugee from the so called third world we can feel the heavy hand of racism in blacktown especially from the police and from those who still live in the era of the white australia policy
6914723 we have some very highly qualified people from overseas in blacktown working as security guards and cleaners meanwhile australia is importing people from britain or the us to work here as nurses or doctors we have to establish a way that these peoples qualifications will be recognised
6914724 there are very few jobs and the jobs that are available are very marginal ones instead of studying to get better qualifications people are forced to work in jobs which are not going to give blacktown a very bright future
6914725 the government is doing nothing to provide lower cost housing
6914726 the average price of a two bedroom flat is around 220 and this is really very high if somebody has only 300 each fortnight particularly for pensioners and single parents
6914727 they teach them how to act in australia but they dont teach them the language they will need to work with
6914728 there are many young families in blacktown and there are not enough places in public or community childcare this forces families to search of private childcare which is very expensive centrelink is helping but the lack of childcare places is still a major barrier for the families
6914729 we have to create places where they can enjoy themselves by learning and playing at the same time
6914730 over the last year many small businesses have been bankrupted because they cannot compete with the westpoint shopping centre
6914731 instead of concentrating all the shops in the one place westpoint and main street we need more shops in the suburbs such as doonside and rooty hill
6914732 the story borders on melodrama a number of times but it never quite goes over that edge
6914733 los abogados de la fox contactaron con warner bros sobre el tema de los derechos de distribuci n en varias ocasiones antes de que empezase la producci n de la pel cula pero fueron rechazados

6914738 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6914739 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6914740 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
6914741 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
6914742 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws
6914743 were trying to say what is the best way to approach this issue
6914744 whether the style of behavior demonstrated by a university president or a professor at a dinner or reception will be replicated by freshmen let loose at their first friday night keg party
6914745 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
6914746 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6914747 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6914748 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights

6914774 shaikh jalaluddin had many disciples in bengal he first lived at lakhnauti constructed a khanqah and attached a langar to it he also bought some gardens and land to be attached to the monastery he moved to devatalla deva mahal near pandua in northern bengal there a kafir either a hindu or a buddhist had erected a large temple and a well the shaikh demolished the temple and constructed a takiya khanqah and converted a large number of kafirs devatalla came to be known as tabrizabad and attracted a large number of pilgrims
6914775 baba uchah ganai went for circumambulation of the two harms mecca and medina in search of the perfect guide pir i kamil he prayed to god to help him when he heard a voice from the unknown that the perfect guide was in kashmir himself hazrat shaikh baba uchah ganai returned to kashmir all of a sudden his eyes fell upon a place of worship the temples of the hindus he smiled when the devotees asked the cause of his smile he replied that the destruction and demolition of these places of worship and the destruction of the idols will take place at the hand of the high horn sheikh shams ud din irraqi he will soon be coming from iraq and shall turn the temples completely desolate and most of the misled people will accept the path of guidance and islam so as was ordained sheikh shams ud din reached kashmir he began destroying the places of worship and the temples of the hindus and made an effort to achieve the objectives
6914776 although at that time there were very many temples of idols around the lake when the khwaja saw them he said if god and his prophet so will it will not be long before i raze to the ground these idol temples
6914777 it is said that among those temples there was one temple to reverence which the raja and all the infidels used to come and lands had been assigned to provide for its expenditure when the khwaja settled there every day his servants bought a cow brought it there and slaughtered it and ate it
6914778 the dev who was their leader when he saw the perfect beauty of the khwaja trembled from head to foot like a willow tree
6914779 the khwaja said i also bestow on you the name of shadi dev joyful dev
6914780 then shadi dev suggested to the khwaja that he should now set up a place in the city where the populace might benefit from his holy arrival
6914781 muin al din had a second wife for the following reason one night he saw the holy prophet in the flesh the prophet said you are not truly of my religion if you depart in any way from my sunnat it happened that the ruler of the patli fort malik khitab attacked the unbelievers that night and captured the daughter of the raja of that land he presented her to muin al din who accepted her and named her bibi umiya
6914782 the take over of pagan sites is a recurrent feature of the history of the expansion of islam the most obvious precedent is to be found in the muslim annexation of the hajar al aswad at mecca sir thomas arnold remarks that in many instances there is no doubt that the shrine of a muslim saint marks the site of some local cult which was practised on the spot long before the introduction of islam there is evidence more reliable than the tradition recorded in the siyar al aqtab to suggest that this was the case in ajmer sculpted stones apparently from a hindu temple are incorporated in the buland darwaza of shrine moreover his tomb is built over a series of cellars which may have formed part of an earlier temple a tradition first recorded in the anis al arwah suggests that the sandal khana is built on the site of shadi devs temple

6914784 it is said that in ancient days trichila an execrable monster with three heads who was a brother of rawan with ten heads had the sway over this country no human being could oppose him but as per the saying of the prophet islam will be elevated and cannot be subdued the faith took root by the efforts of hazarat natthar wali the monster was slain and sent to the house of perdition his image namely but ling worshipped by the unbelievers was cut and the head was separated from the body a portion of the body went into the ground over that spot is the tomb of the wali shedding rediance till this day
6914785 shah bheka when he was at trichinopoly during the days of rani minachi the unbelievers who did not like his stay there harassed him one day when he was very much vexed he got upon the bull in front of the temple which the hindus worship calling it swami and made it move on by the power and strength of the supreme life giver they abandoned the temple and gave the entire place on the aruskalwa as present to the shah
6914786 hazarat nur muhammad qadiri was the most unique man regarded as an invaluable person of his age very often he was the cause of the ruin of temples some of these were laid waste he selected his own burial ground in the vicinity of the temple although he lived five hundred years ago people at large still remember his greatness
6914787 j t osullivan will be our starting quarterback going into the season and im expecting him to succeed
6914788 im very confident j t is at the point where hes our best man for the job right now
6914789 this hasnt been a case of alex and shaun not performing well
6914790 this has been a case of j t performing very well thats why we are where we are j t has very good command of the offense hes played well in all three preseason games and now its time for us to get ready for the regular season
6914791 this is the way they campaign this is the way we campaign
6914792 there is a time when a tax credit becomes obsolete as a matter of fiscal policy
6914793 according to the legislative fiscal bureau the total uw budget was 2 5 billion in 1996 97 by 2006 07 just 10 years later the total system budget had ballooned to 4 3 billion an average increase of 5 7 per year over a decade of that budget state general purpose revenue increased every year from 1996 97 844 million to 2002 03 1 08 billion until governor jim doyle proposed cutting 250 million from the system over a two year period shame on wmc for getting doyle elected by 2006 07 state aid had increased to 1 04 billion per year with the legislature granting campuses the authority to levy 909 million in tuition more than twice the 400 million they collected in 1996 97
6914794 which economies should we aspire to the dynamic high income high tech twenty first century economies of minnesota delaware and massachusetts or the economies of south carolina tennessee and alabama
6914795 it is equally clear that higher taxation by itself hasnt hampered the economies of states that are outperforming wisconsin and lower taxation hasnt made the economies of tennessee and alabama any better in ways that benefit the citizens of those states
6914796 honestly if any political science student at uw madison used that kind of hyperbole in one of their research papers they should be forced to re take the course unless it was taught by kevin barrett

6914808 to explain it as a realist while remaining a surrealist by displacing the object in another context in this new setting the object rediscovers its quality as an object
6914809 i believe that the simulation argument is sound the argument shows only that at least one of three possibilities obtains but it does not tell us which one s one can thus accept the simulation argument and reject the simulation hypothesis i e that we are in a simulation
6914810 thus the simulation argument is not best thought of as a skeptical argument that would have us be more agnostic but rather as an argument that would have us increase our credence in one particular disjunction and decrease our credence in its negation it aims to tell us something about the world rather than to advise us that we know less about the world than we thought we did

6914812 the adoption of the shareholder rights plan is part of an ongoing effort by the board to protect and maximize the value of the shareholders investment in the company and to give them the optimum opportunity to participate in the long term value of the company after several months of consideration the board determined that adopting the shareholder rights plan is an effective and reasonable method to safeguard the interests of our shareholders we are focused on building value for our shareholders and our intent is to continue our strategy the purpose of the shareholder rights plan is to enable the company to continue moving forward with these plans without being subject to the distraction caused by tactics which may not maximize value for all of our shareholders
6914813 we appreciate the royalty holders vote of confidence in gryphon gold the restructuring of the royalty eliminates the uncertainty of a variable rate royalty which could have become a heavy burden as the price of gold rises further a fixed royalty should greatly improve the ability to finance a potential production decision on either of our two gold deposits at the borealis
6914814 with an approximate fair market value of us 6 4 million for the transaction we estimate that at 800 ounce of gold and an initial production rate of 50 000 ounce of gold per year from the oxide mine only gryphon gold would recover the cost of reducing the royalty in just over 5 years

6914818 in the last half century u s preschool attendance has gone up to nearly 70 from 16 but fourth grade reading science and math scores on the national assessment of educational progress naep the nations report card have remained virtually stagnant since the early 1970s
6914819 the results from oklahoma and georgia both of which implemented universal preschool a decade or more ago paint an equally dismal picture
6914820 the government of canada is serious about keeping our northern communities safe which is why we are focusing our crime prevention efforts on those who are most at risk
6914821 todays funding announcement highlights our commitment to working with the government of yukon and key stakeholders to support projects that are developed locally and respond to local needs
6914822 we are pleased with this latest significant public safety investment by the government of canada
6914823 this latest funding will compliment the ongoing work and accomplishments achieved to date in yukon
6914824 the narcotics checkpoints main objective was to get the narcotics off of the street
6914825 anything off of the streets is not in the hands of kids or anyone else
6914826 there just happened to be narcotics officers out there and it just so happened that we did our safety checkpoint in a certain area where the place is known for drug trafficking it just so happened they were all in the right place at the right time
6914827 the markets current lack of development capital positions tiomin to develop strategic partnerships with good quality juniors which may lead to further debt and equity investments the risk adjusted return to tiomin is attractive and this secured investment is only a small portion of our cash balance freegold has a highly prospective exploration portfolio in the united states and an experienced management

6914832 we had a great senior class and lost some outstanding players
6914833 but i think we have a solid nucleus returning i think the young players coming in will also vie for playing time
6914834 we put a lot of pressure and probably expectations on them last years seniors
6914835 this team is different the chemistry is different and i think its a good different
6914836 they had a good fall camp and i look for it to continue right into the season and nick and tim will be a major part of our success
6914837 he came back eager to pick up where he left off last year and could develop into one of the offensive leaders of this team
6914838 it appears he has continued to elevate his game over the summer heading into this season i look for him to continue to show the same progress this season as he did from his freshman to sophomore season
6914839 we wont rely on just one man to score as we probably have the last couple of years
6914840 i also think youll see us utilize more players this season
6914841 we have some outstanding newcomers some of which will redshirt
6914842 but i think youll see some real contributions from several of the newcomers
6914843 i dont put much stock in the pre season polls regardless if were ranked first or sixth
6914844 i think this team will have a better than expected season
6914845 he set out to locate a site of worship a place abandoned old isolated and decayed actually there were many such places to choose from and by a completely arbitrary means of selection he soon managed to settle on one of them this numinous structure bashed in roof and battered walls he cluttered with the fetishes of his new creed these consisted of anything he could find which had a divine aura of disuse of unfulfillment hopelessness disintegration of grotesque imbecility and senselessness dolls with broken faces he put on display in corners and upon crumbling pedestals thin lifeless trees he dug up whole from their natural graves and transplanted into the cracked tiles of the floors mosaic then he hung lamps of thick green glass by corroded chains from the ceiling and the withered branches of the trees were bathed in hues of livid mold as were the faces of the dolls and those of various mummified creatures including two human abortions which were set floating in jars at opposite ends of an altar draped with rags his vestments were also of rags their frayed edges fluttering like dead leaves about to fall standing before the altar he raised his arms over something that smoldered which was his own dried excrement upon a tarnished plate he glanced about at the defunct forest of which he was king at the brittle twisting branches some of which were adorned with hanging dolls and other things at all the various objects of refuse he had added to his collection finally at the green waters of those two occupied jars glowing upon the rags of the altar and he widened his mouth to speak and he said nothing so distracted was he with a gruesome contentment his old wonder had been ravaged and his hunger for mockery fulfilled

6914852 lets think for a moment of all those who passed before us because this is for them too

6914854 and for that for the actions of past governments let me say im very sorry
6914855 we want you to be the ones to set the direction for this
6914856 there should be more than an apology coming to the people of kalaupapa and of hawaii

6915074 we are pleased to be able to offer the airs system at a significant discount with free training to nlc and iafc members
6915075 based on the interest we generated during the webcast we want to insure we make the airs system economically accessible to all municipalities and fire chiefs wishing to deploy airs and its life saving features
6915076 the airs system has the capability to save lives and allow first responders to more efficiently manage their resources while providing a level of situational awareness not achieved prior to the use of this technology
6915077 it is critical that new technologies be applied in the fire service to help us help our own if they get trapped
6915078 if you can enable a rapid intervention team rit with the technology to find a downed firefighter with precision youve given them a fighting chance at reaching them in time to save one of their own there can be nothing more important to a firefighter than saving one of our own
6915079 we are pleased to be able make cities aware of this promising new technology through nlc tv
6915080 city officials are always looking for new solutions to e protect first responders in the line of duty
6915081 this technology was originally developed for the us dept of defenses
6915082 now that its being adopted by commercial companies for tracking and monitoring the status of shipments the price has dropped dramatically so that it can be deployed at a reasonable cost the lives of our first responders are invaluable so now that the price is reasonable we want cities to be able to take advantage of these advances in networked people trackers and sensors
6915083 we had significant traffic for this nlc tv webcast including viewership from the first responder community and fire chiefs nationally
6915084 the airs system is attracting a lot of attention across the country as we continue to see growing traffic to the video archive of the webcast over the last several weeks becomes more viral in the community
6915085 in the time period leading to the two national conventions and the inauguration that are all scheduled in the next 5 months the number of incidents will likely be on the rise
6915086 undts 5 agent detectors can accurately detect the presence of the 5 top bio terror threats in as little as 3 minutes
6915087 one of the most important things i look for when i evaluate a healing community and i think has that raw material is how well they provide the holistic care to their patients do you go past just the automatic reflexive life saving intervention you made on somebody to open a closed artery and make sure it doesnt happen again do you educate the community do you see each patient as part of an army that can go home and share the lessons youve shared with them so they can pass on the information and if we can do this intelligently we can build an america thats a lot healthier to live in
6915088 we are very grateful to the patients and study sites that participated in the azeptic trial the efforts of all the team members who joined us in this endeavor are to be commended completion of the azeptic trial is a significant milestone for ash access technology and reaffirms our commitment to develop breakthrough products in infection control we expect to analyze the data in the coming weeks and look forward to presenting it to the fda shortly

6915114 e dezastru ceva de groaza n a mai fost niciodata asa ceva pe aici nici de la batrinii mei n am auzit de asa ceva
6915115 nici nu pot dormi noaptea din cauza lor ma termina chiar daca dau cu trei sprayuri in fiecare seara prin casa parca e degeaba mi e si rusine sa mai port fusta de cite semne am pe picioare din cauza tintarilor mi e si frica sa nu capat vreo boala sa nu fie insecte infectate cu ceva
6915116 trebuie sa intram in casa devreme seara pentru ca afara nu se poate sta din cauza tintarilor niciodata nu au fost atit de multi nu stim nici noi cum sa i stirpim am dat foc la gunoaie ude mai fug ei din cauza fumului insa se intorc la loc si parca mai multi in gradina de porumb nici nu te poti apropia
6915117 parintii mei locuiesc in satul orpiseni din tutora si nici nu mai stiu cum sa se descurce cu tintarii nici nu poti respira ca ti intra in gura sint roiuri intregi miliarde mama nu se poate duce in gradina dupa legume decit cu tifon pe fata am sesizat autoritatile dar deocamdata nimic
6915118 vegetatia bogata si baltile de dupa inundatii au incurajat aparitia acestor insecte ne am gindit sa stropim cu diverse solutii insa pentru asta am avea nevoie de un elicopter chiar ieri n r miercuri am fost la aeroport sa vorbim in acest sens ni s a spus ca ne costa aproape 150 000 lei nici bugetul nostru pentru un an intreg nu e asa mare
6915119 pe linga banii pentru elicopter ne mai trebuie si pentru solutia de stropit am si vrut sa cumparam insa nu am gasit pe nimeni care sa produca asa ceva industrial si nu avem ce face cu citeva grame mai ales ca am discutat sa stropim aproximativ 200 de hectare din cite am inteles si solutia este la fel de scumpa ca si elicopterul
6915120 este o problema serioasa niciodata n au fost asa multi ca acum si parca sint si mult mai agresivi decit de obicei nu avem prevedere bugetara pentru astfel de situatii astfel ca sintem blocati
6915121 e mult mai rau ca in alti ani dam cu spray in casa insa afara nu ai ce sa faci
6915122 este nevoie de un aparat de zbor special care sa imprastie o solutie contra tintarilor si asta presupune o cheltuiala consistenta deocamdata nu am reusit sa gasim oferte in zona noastra pentru asa ceva iesenii trebuie sa stie ca aceasta problema este in atentia noastra si ca speram ca intr o saptamina sa putem gasi un elicopter sau avion
6915123 alte tipuri de tintari cel anofel de exemplu pot transmite malarie febra galbena febra nilului care duce la o forma de encefalita si alte astfel de afectiuni la noi insa nu exista tintari care sa reprezinte un pericol pentru sanatate cu exceptia disconfortului pe care il creeaza prin faptul ca sint atit de multi in rest nu sint probleme
6915124 merg seara de seara cu copilul la plimbare in parcul copou nu mai vazusem niciodata tintari pe acolo insa in ultimele zile nu stiu ce se intimpla dar vin basicata toata acasa si eu si copilul abia te mai poti apara mai nou ne dam cu autan inainte de plimbare de cind ma stiu nu am vazut tintari in parcul copou nu stiu care este cauza aparitiei lor acum
6915125 vom vorbi cu un departament de pe linga directia agricola care se ocupa cu problemele legate de daunatori si vom vedea ce masuri se pot lua in privinta tintarilor de obicei se stropeste impotriva lor dupa lasarea serii cind e racoare si are un efect mai puternic

6915204 the fact is clint zweifel has a plan for increasing college affordability while gov blunt has failed to keep college affordable and senator brad lager doesnt believe the state should help families afford college
6915205 governor blunt affirmed the state of iowa had the highest average cost for tuition and fees at four year public universities of any state with a school in the big 12
6915206 average annual tuition at four year public universities is higher in missouri than in any other big 12 state
6915207 the olympic moments that touch your heart and purify your soul belong to those who are fighting destiny triumphing over adversity or proving to the world that love can be as deep as ocean

6915210 the nations feeling of britishness when watching britain compete has soared by almost a third since the start of the olympics
6915211 we cannot underestimate the value of an occasion such as the olympics to the social cohesion of our nation
6915212 pe nesu l am vindut olandezilor de la utrecht si voi lua in schimbul lui un milion de euro dar el va pleca dupa meciul cu galatasaray din liga campionilor
6915213 stabilisem toate detaliile contractului iar jucatorul era de acord sa semneze cu noi a venit insa cineva care a pretins ca este impresarul lui neagoe si a cerut un comision spunind ca in caz contrar fotbalistul nu semneaza am refuzat dupa care am discutat cu cei de la steaua care ne au spus ca din moment ce ne am inteles neagoe nu poate pleca la bistrita asa cum ne a anuntat impresarul jucatorului acum asteptam sa vedem ce se intimpla
6915214 it was 30 years and i just had it with the hauling down the expressway in the morning and stuck in traffic in the afternoon
6915215 i needed some money and i needed some structure in my routine
6915216 i didnt have enough spunk enough outside stimulation to rise from the couch and do anything useful
6915217 the only problem is i dont have enough time to do what i would like to do mostly the stuff at home as long as it works ill stay with it
6915218 you should do some financial planning and you should also do some planning ahead for personal enrichment you got to have some reason to get up in the morning plan some goals to achieve
6915219 its like any stage of your life hopefully longer than many
6915220 i joined a writing group at the harborfields library and went back to the pottery studio
6915221 but if thats what the people want im not going to waste a bunch of time and fight it
6915222 he said are you working do you need a ride and she was like no and he pulled out the gun and shot her in the chest
6915223 as long as i committed a crime in their presence their trust went up
6915224 most guys think that cause i am hot that im like this super slut like mos
6915225 i am young and unknown to many of you i was born and have ever remained in the most humble walks of life
6915226 when you think of an african american presidential candidate it closes the loop that lincoln opened which was about human equality about the worthiness of every person
6915227 there are multiple reasons why sen obama chooses a lincoln site including covering for his short time in illinois trying to show people who are leery that he has midwestern values and trying to draw a parallel on experience between he and lincoln since both made a gigantic quick step toward the presidency
6915228 a presidential race is to a great extent about symbolism
6915229 barack obama has demonstrated he has the ability to evoke potent and powerful symbols about the highest office that anyone can achieve in the united states
6915230 seventy six people all civilians and most of them women and children were martyred during the operation by coalition forces in shindand district of herat province
6915231 19 women seven men and the rest children all under 15 years of age
6915232 the interior ministry while expressing its profound regret because of this incident which happened by accident has sent a delegation of 10 people to the area and more details will be announced once the investigation is completed
6915233 the coalition remains confident in our reports that were released earlier today
6915234 but ive respected the process from day one and i want to continue to do that today and allow any details about the process and final decisions to be made by senator obama and their campaign not by anybody else
6915235 i am not in that arena this is his decision and i respect him to make it however he thinks is best for him and the country
6915236 i think its a fair assessment that ive done more than anybody else in my position
6915237 john toplikar s last minute grandstanding during the budget vote last week was just that he put on a show for the uninformed
6915238 toplikar attended each and every one of these and chose not to suggest any budget cuts or amendments during any of these hearings
6915239 please check the transcripts for any input or objections from commissioner toplikar there are none if commissioner toplikar wanted to suggest true budget cuts he could have done so during any of the numerous budget presentations made by virtually every department in the county
6915240 the presentations were not made to just pass air through the lungs of the department heads or to pass the time commissioner toplikar should have paid attention and he could have gained the support of his fellow commissioners by requesting budget cuts at the appropriate time
6915241 instead toplikar suggested superficial cuts with no real numbers to support his mistimed motions which appropriately died for a lack of support
6915242 in each and every suggestion toplikar had no documentation then in a total reversal after he wasted the time of the whole commission he voted for the 2009 budget all toplikar accomplished was to alienate his fellow commissioners and again demonstrate that he continues to be out of touch with what is going on around him
6915243 toplikars grandstanding didnt save the taxpayers of johnson county one thin dime
6915244 there are areas that true tax savings can be made
6915245 at this rate the only people for the ripper to attack will be us
6915246 youre the one who is supposed to be his equal i hoped my voice did not sound nearly as flippant as i felt
6915247 it was foolish of us to think that the ripper would simply appear before us
6915248 its not as if hed be standing there clutching a butcher knife and the bloody heart of a dead prostitute
6915249 holmes would laugh at me if he knew where i was right now hed admonish me for poking around blindly i use the unique gifts which the creator has seen fit to bestow on me hed say then hed go about using some deuced elaborate means of conjuring up where the killer was i imagine
6915250 you a medical doctor with battlefield experience who has spent the past decade apprenticing under the keenest investigative mind to ever walk the earth and i with no deductive experience do possess a discerning mind and have seen much of this worlds underbelly
6915251 to view the handiwork of jack the ripper for ourselves
6915252 lets see what we two can discover even without the benefit of the mighty sherlock holmes
6915253 holmes knocks with authority letting everyone know he is on about serious business
6915254 we apologize for disturbing you at such a late hour but weve come about urgent business
6915255 youll not treat such a distinguished man as doctor john watson like so
6915256 were here on a special assignment from scotland yard doctor watson is to inspect the bodies of the ripper victims for clues and take his findings directly to sherlock holmes himself
6915257 better not be anymore damned lookie loos busybodies ill ave yez sorted after a right battering
6915258 please the attendant squealed and raced down the hall into darkness recognized yez right off
6915259 take down constable fawkes full name so that i know exactly how to spell it for my new sherlock holmes story titled the case of the dead harlots now dont misspell it like you did when we spoke to the chief inspector
6915260 hawkes is much too important to my story to have any mistakes made
6915261 we need inside details not what was in the papers locked her up for drunk an disorderly not a bad sprout an aw as it goes for her sort
6915262 about one in the morning out in dutfields yard off berner street
6915263 yez dont need to be seeing that an aw not fit for a lady nor a gentleman like the doctor
6915264 i was instructed to view the bodies for clues by the great detective
6915265 the extent to which the land described in these applications can be issued has not been investigated and therefore this letter should not be construed as an indication that any permits will be issued as a full review is still to be completed
6915266 its a lot easier if everywhere in lombard is 25 miles per hour
6915267 if you still support it i think we need to move forward
6915268 i dont agree with this piecemeal approach it should be more uniform its logical
6915269 it can be done just not as easily as in other communities
6915270 people will drive the speed they believe they can reasonably drive
6915271 a positive signal that vindicates previous misgivings surrounding the occurrence of the incident
6915272 we hope as civil society this action will bring the much desired outcome of a comprehensive independent investigation that will unearth the facts with the full cooperation of the states concerned and possibly identify and bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice
6915273 i think everyone was just too busy and we didnt get the vendors
6915274 it was a combination of things but everyone the staff and committee members were busy doing other things
6915275 spectator attendance has been slim except for some of the bigger events so i am hoping we can capture people coming out for the rides and live music
6915276 we want to do something to give back to the community
6915277 local peoples everywhere need to feel that they are benefiting from massive energy interventions
6915278 if people dont get that then they become the bandits some of them when people do get that they become key members of local civil society
6915279 on all of these things including security well help if we can if were asked
6915280 the sentence is appropriate and we are pleased that the victims have been spared the emotional trauma of testifying in court
6915281 were in our 44th year and the program has definitely grown
6915282 the area does get a huge influx of traffic on the weekends
6915283 maybe people can car pool or bring a bus so there isnt so many vehicles its tough when people park on both sides of the street the street is only 32 feet wide and it wasnt designed for that
6915284 it will be an inconvenience and people may have to park farther away but i understand why village officials did this
6915285 people were parking illegally sometimes this will be a safer environment
6915286 everybody either has to go to elgin or to huntley or probably to hampshire we have no essential services
6915287 im distressed by the lack of data of any sort even at the most basic level
6915288 worked on overtime scenarios and special situation field goals reviewed goal line and two point plays and some of our personnel packages
6915289 it was a mixed bag of special situations that you dont get to spend a lot of time working on during a practice week
6915290 i like attention i love men i like the glam outfits and the role playing i love being able to go nude in front of strangers i want them to enjoy my body i like to make men laugh in clubs i like to talk to them at stage side when theyre watching me dance

6915293 farul e o echipa valoroasa o respectam insa cred ca avem forta de a invinge
6915294 sa fim determinati si mobilizati si sa jucam putin mai bine decit in primele reprize ale meciurilor cu craiova steaua si bistrita cind am evoluat destul de bine in plus trebuie sa avem forta de a juca si impotriva arbitrilor pentru ca la cum am fost arbitrati pina acum e clar ca sintem vinati
6915295 rezultatele pe care le am obtinut pina acum se datoreaza greselilor pe care le am facut in proportie de 60 si arbitrilor 40 daca primeam penalty in minutul 15 la craiova aveam alt moral si obtineam alte rezultate in toate meciurile am fost tocati nimeni nu spune ca la bistrita a trebuit sa scot ambii atacanti pentru ca au fost loviti pina s au accidentat ci se spune ca popa e antrenor prost ca i schimba pe bilba si tanasa mai grav e ca nimeni nu ne baga in seama si cred ca sintem prea mici pentru un razboi asa de mare
6915296 mi e ciuda de caderea care apare cind luam gol asa ca m am gindit chiar sa apelez la un psiholog jucatorii nu au vrut insa spunindu mi ca eu sint cel mai bun psiholog sper ca acest lucru sa se vada simbata
6915297 din pacate nu am avut norocul altor ani cind am intilnit repede nou promovate de am fost chiar si pe primul loc e foarte posibil ca in zece etape sa nu luam nici un punct pentru ca avem o programare foarte grea oricum daca echipa nu si va reveni si mergem la matineu nu va fi nici o tragedie tragedie e la madrid unde s a prabusit avionul
6915298 pe la colturi am auzit ca unii jucatori sint acuzati ca au inceput sa vinda meciuri eu anulez cu tarie din start aceasta idee pentru ca in toti acesti cinci ani am fost o familie daca exista insa situatii de acest gen nu pot decit sa ma gindesc ca dumnezeu e sus si le vede pe toate

6915335 this tour in addition to the other alternative and renewable energy sites in my district is a perfect example of the energy policy that house republicans are working to pass as we speak the american public has made it clear that they support an energy policy that includes renewable and alternative energy in addition to the safe and responsible recovery of our domestic natural resources house republicans have laid out such a plan in h r 6566 the american energy act and h res 1206 which i introduced on may 15th
6915336 whip blunt and the house republican leadership have made it clear that we will continue to fight to have comprehensive energy reform legislation pass in congress as the democrat leadership continues to ignore the will of the american public
6915337 the fact that we erased all of yesterdays gains so fast suggests that were still in a bear market theres just not much demand out there

6915339 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force around this time last year has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment

6915343 anything that would better in real life with one eye closed
6915344 in previous incarnations of 3d you would wear a pair of paper glasses with red and cyan filters that allows only red light to enter one eye and anything but red to enter the other eye the left and right stereo images are then processed so that one has only its red values and the other has the green and blue values your brain then reassembles the images in to 3d this process is called anaglyph 3d the big advantage of anaglyph 3d is that you can display the images using standard film print technologies the downside is that it is a really awful 3d image creating the image requires throwing away have the information available and because it isnt the way your brain is used to seeing 3d it can lead to eye strain and headaches

6915353 you are not going to get anything out of me on the vice presidential nothin
6915354 i think the fact that the campaign could hold the information so closely for so long says a lot about the obama campaign
6915355 it says that theres a trusted circle of people around senator obama that he can trust and who have a lot of confidence and faith in him

6915371 i was very happy at liverpool and had no desire to leave but charles roberts his agent told me i should not dismiss the opportunity outright
6915372 when charles told me what napoli were offering it made my eyes water i was to receive 1m as a signing on fee
6915373 i was aware of my knees trembling and i nearly fainted when charles told me the bones of the deal
6915374 in addition to the signing on fee napoli was willing to pay me another 1m over a three year contract it was a thursday and the italian transfer deadline was 48 hours off charles told me that if i did not sign by saturday all bets were off
6915375 liverpool chairman john smith was in london watching the tennis at wimbledon and in the days before mobile phones charles didnt manage to get in touch until friday
6915376 mr smith told him he needed time to think and refused to discuss the matter until the monday morning which of course was two days after the italian transfer deadline
6915377 i managed to contact mr smith asked if i could come down to london to discuss the matter only for him to refuse point blank
6915378 though still not 100 per cent sure about whether i wanted to move or not i was angered by mr smiths reaction given the urgency of the impending deadline
6915379 the deadline came and went as a consequence the deal collapsed i then received a call from charles to say napoli had been in touch having been unable to speak to mr smith theyd had no alternative but to look elsewhere and had signed diego maradona
6915380 i was so upset with the chairmans belligerence and rudeness in not even returning napolis calls that for a long time a

6915389 the definitive authority of indian gaming is the federal agency the bureau of indian affairs bia which is under the auspices of the department of interior they have told us that since there is no federally recognized tribe or tribal land in ohio there is no possibility of any tribal gaming in ohio we have also consulted experts in the field of indian gaming to verify all facts
6915390 our approach has always been to be open and honest about this project from disclosure of our partners at lakes entertainment to clearly letting the voters know that this is a full scale casino our intent is to always respond to any questions or misinformation about this issue our facility will be built with private sector dollars and will be the largest private investment in ohio in the 21st century with no tax abatements or credits we are proud of this fact
6915391 further ohios general assembly and governor would have to pass a law with majorities in both houses to approve any tribal petition this has been tried multiple times over the years and because there are no federally recognized tribes in ohio has failed only by an act of the legislature could the state recognize a tribe in ohio and in 205 years that has not happened and will not happen

6915412 zuma nesta rock sounds like a water park ride or a new energy drink zuma is unusual and rather appealing for a girl its said to be taken from zuma beach in malibu and while place names are great they have to fit the gender of the baby but with the a ending and the popular z beginning as in zoe zelda zora zuma just sounds too feminine so does nesta supposedly bob marleys real name and its not a good idea to pair two a endings as first and middle names too cutesy
6915413 rock is probably thrown in there just to point to the parents careers and it does help to add some masculinity
6915414 this celeb couple certainly succeeded in choosing an unusual name and they succeeded in making an even stronger statement about their fondness for jamaica kingston is named after jamaicas capital and nesta was jamaican singer bob marleys given first name
6915415 when it comes to historical naming tradition both zuma and nesta are most frequently considered girls names as this child grows up he will likely encounter some name induced gender identity issues
6915416 as for the subliminal effect the first name zuma will encourage a career in acting or music so this baby could find himself following in a parents footsteps with ease but he is also likely to flounder when it comes to communication and relationship compatibility because he carries a name that will establish a highly private nature
6915417 it seems the rossdales scarified quality for quirkiness and its a good bet little zuma may be investigating a name change at some point down the road
6915418 first of all zuma zuma is a diminutive of the aztec name montezuma not sure the rossdales realize that but its also associated with the zuma beach in los angeles which is really beautiful a lot of people are using place names now and i think they used it after the beach most likely
6915419 i would recommend that the boy grow up using the name rock rossdale because thats probably the only normal name in there hes gonna grow up in the creative community so i dont think hell get picked on too much but theres only one percent of people surveyed on babynames com that said they loved it and 50 percent said they hated it thats a lot
6915420 kingston seems so upper class and just sophisticated that everybody was expecting another name that went along with it
6915421 instead of running to try to help my son he ran from the scene
6915422 he left my son and grandson to burn to death
6915423 my advice would be that if this book comes out and it contains things that are not true about what happened on that evening it would be my advice to them to make sure she doesnt make one single penny off of it
6915424 i think it would be fabulous and i dont think anybody would think badly about her in any way shape or form
6915425 the book is more about some choices that shes made in her life that shes regretful about
6915426 we felt sorry for her and we felt to some degree she had been victimized by the process
6915427 we wanted it to be over and clearly she doesnt want it to be over

6915435 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6915436 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6915437 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6915438 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6915439 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in

6915446 however you do see the gunman clearly kill a firefighter then himself
6915447 the firefighter had no chance he never saw the shooter coming he had his back completely to the shooter all together

6915462 in this case the plain and unambiguous language of act 321 of 1907 makes clear that the general assembly delegated power to the city to issue submerged lands licenses
6915463 moreover it is equally clear by application of fundamental precepts of statutory construction that no intervening act removed that power nor did the general assemblys recent expression during the pendency of this litigation operate to undo the authority the city enjoyed when it acted in november of 2007
6915464 we recognize that there has been a change in the executive office in philadelphia but the view of the current director of commerce for the city does not affect or undermine the legitimate exercise of the authority reposed in the former director of commerce

6915470 a major shift is under way in the politics and power balance of the islamic world and it calls for a fundamental change in american and western strategic thinking handled well the shift holds out the possibility of a lasting thaw in the tensions that now dominate relations between the west and islam but if it is mishandled or ignored the likely result will be a continuation of the current dangerous spiral downward right now it appears that our leaders republicans and democrats alike are missing the warning signs

6915504 its just best to have their full attention on the first day of classes
6915505 sometimes its tough to get a lot done that day while theyre tending to the academic side so its important to get everything lined up right there first and then turn to football
6915506 i really believe that no one can put more pressure on me than myself thats just the way i am
6915507 no one gets more mad at me when i throw an incomplete pass than me i think my coaches know that and i think my teammates know that its just the way i play the game its the way i approach the game the way that i prepare for the game wont allow me to fail thats just the way i feel
6915508 i think were each different in the styles we play
6915509 dan can do more things with his feet than i can but i think i can make some different throws that he cant make nate davis has a great arm i think ability wise theres not much difference between us but we each bring something different to the table to help our team win and i think our different abilities showed when you look at the stats from last year
6915510 i think my wife knows how bullheaded and tough i am but i think when you feel like you may lose somebody things change

6915514 i knew then what i was facing i think if i was ever down it was when
6915515 you read that i am third book where it talks about god family and then football and youd say jerry kill have you lived that way no
6915516 all these coaches tell you they do i need to meet one of them am i proud of that no but ive lived that way in my heart did i want it that other way yes but theres a lot of times i put football and family and god in no particular order but i spent more time doing football and worrying about career i love my family but was it really first thats a lie
6915517 if my daughters or my wife said hey i cant take this anymore and we need you and this games wearing you out id give it up
6915518 i wouldnt have two years ago for them but i would do that for them today because theyve sacrificed a hell of a lot for me

6915574 last year he was playing at a pro bowl level
6915575 he had good receivers a good tight end and good rhythm we definitely had to get ready for a big challenge
6915576 the guy played lights out last year there was no need for him to retire
6915577 but im not brett favre that was his personal decision looking at that game playing against him i didnt see a guy who you would say ah hes washed up he wasnt washed up he was playing at the peak of his game

6915639 i just want to keep riding the way i have these last couple of races and try and get some more podiums i think southwick is a really good track i race really well there
6915640 i got third overall at southwick last year after finishing third in both motos
6915641 im looking forward to racing there again this week ive been practicing and getting ready for the weekend ive been keeping my program the same just going week to week having two wins in a row has definitely helped with my confidence with my mind now im just ready to get in there and race and carry my momentum forward
6915642 ive really just been staying with my routine this week
6915643 im sticking with my usual training schedule ive been doing a little bit longer rides a few longer motos just to get ready for the sand at southwick ive never raced there but i know this will be our first track with rough sand it should be interesting
6915644 we are absolutely planning to start school with our students
6915645 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6915646 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6915647 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6915648 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6915649 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6915650 freedomland the pulitzer nominated drama by local playwright amy freed in the outdoor setting of theatre in the woods
6915651 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6915652 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6915653 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6915654 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6915655 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6915656 i think the easiest way to explain kinetic art isart that moves
6915657 sometimes it is movement driven by water or it is hand activated my work is basically wind driven
6915658 it moves with just a small one hopefully there wont be a big one
6915659 but i dont consider myself an artist i have the knowledge of steam and steam powered things
6915660 dicks really good at what he does hes got a lot of experience on us
6915661 we want to make sure we have qualified people on board
6915662 i spent my career developing state of the art putting people on the moon stuff on the weekends i revert
6915663 people love old machinery that was built well the original engineers made them functional but they were pretty to look at it was their art the old engineers that build them had an eye for beauty its something we appreciate
6915664 dick and i are the odd guys in that were coming at this from a first love of vintage steam and we combine it with the industrial art aspect
6915665 it was pretty amazing i have never experienced anything like it
6915666 everyone was dead tired but it was a lot of fun
6915667 it was worse than burning man but rebuilding it was the right thing to do it was the safe thing to do this project would not have happened without dick
6915668 ive watched some really amazing things come together with these guys
6915669 it gives an old guy new energy its just fun
6915670 i completed my two year contract and i feel like i accomplished what i set out to do
6915671 we value and appreciate the vision bob has put in place for montalvo
6915672 he has helped us broaden our artistic programs by integrating contemporary art throughout the organization
6915673 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6915674 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6915675 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6915676 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6915677 rue la la is an exclusive invitation only online destination where members discover premier brand private sale boutiques each open for just a brief window of time we hope to bring our members a welcoming shopping experience full of discovery and pleasure our focus is a well edited collection of sought after offerings from the best brand names in the world combined with helpful service
6915678 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6915679 mitigating risk managing costs and speeding delivery these are three functions that characterize a successful construction project when done well
6915680 using virtual construction contractors build the building twice once with the bim model in preconstruction and planning and once on site building that planning model with integrated cost and schedule data invites real informed collaboration within the project team and that leads to fewer rfis well managed risks and a higher quality experience and result for the owner that bigger picture is holders vision and they truly deserve this recognition by constructech
6915681 getting subcontractors involved early in the process is critical for the success of any bim project
6915682 this is one area where wed like to see bim coordination grow we should be able to accept and incorporate models from all the subcontractors in order to fine tune estimates and scheduling
6915683 over the course of the last few years constructech magazine has watched the emergence of bim technologies
6915684 we are happy to honor holder and vico with the vision award not just because they utilized a new technology successfully but because they realize how much further the technology can advance the aec industry
6915685 while data393 supports the city of denvers hosting role for the dnc we believe environmental responsibility cuts across all political affiliations
6915686 green data centers not only save energy they also reduce the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades to deal with increased power and cooling demands through the incorporation of advanced data center technologies data393 is becoming an industry leader in eco friendly cooling and power optimization which allows us to keep our costs down
6915687 the introduction of green technologies in the facility not only answers the call to action for environmentally friendly data centers but it provides a new opportunity to customers to take advantage of the cost savings that consolidation high density space and virtualized environments provide
6915688 newforma could not ask for a better qualified partner to service the needs of architectural and engineering firms in this market control groups vertical domain understanding and consulting services experience reduce costs and raise efficiency for clients by working together control group and newforma will make firms more profitable and better prepared to meet the challenges of integrated practice delivery
6915689 its a managed services provider focusing on architects and engineers in one of the nations most concentrated markets for architects and engineers as a result of their expertise control group understands the specialized needs of this industry and is therefore in a particularly good position to be a newforma authorized var partner
6915690 joining forces with newforma fits with our model of partnering with the leading technology companies serving architects engineers and constructors such as autodesk deltek and microsoft
6915691 our aec clients look to us to be their single source for technology solutions with the addition of newforma project center software to our offerings were the first managed services company in new york to provide the industrys most complete innovative solution for pim
6915692 is expected to give robust proof of concept for the nasal formulation designed to kill mrsa hiding in the nose
6915693 this continuation of an earlier study is a concrete expression of sinofreshs commitment to exploring ways to protect and promote nasal and upper respiratory health and hygiene
6915694 these results have exceeded our expectations the positive results of this in vivo study gives us the solid scientific platform we have needed in order to advance our efforts to fight mrsa to the next level
6915695 since bacteria can in effect change their metabolism to be resistant to antibiotics but cant very well change the laws of physics the chances for development of resistance to sinofresh nasal sprays mode of killing them is much lower

6915719 that ash tree is going to need to come down regardless
6915720 if you use wood from that tree theres another tree somewhere else that didnt have to get cut down
6915721 unfortunately its kind of timely relative to the emerald ash borer problems with a lot of our ash trees
6915722 but if we could turn it into electricity and energy to power up businesses and homes then its a good use
6915723 were trying to get people to understand that ash is a gorgeous wood
6915724 its perceived to be kind of a common wood but thats not true
6915725 its beautiful and it has a lot of variety of how it can look which for a furniture designer is wonderful
6915726 i almost feel like we dont deserve it that im walking into high school musical or something

6915728 barack obama announces he wont announce vp selection because the free media is just too damned good
6915729 please excuse me but im planning to teach my child not to let strangers get personal with him so i had better practice that myself
6915730 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6915731 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6915732 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6915733 as much as half of the water used to grow food globally may be lost or wasted
6915734 curbing these losses and improving water productivity provides win win opportunities for farmers business ecosystems and the global hungry an effective water saving strategy requires that minimising food wastage is firmly placed on the political agenda
6915735 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6915736 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6915737 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6915738 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6915739 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6915740 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6915741 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6915742 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6915743 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6915744 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6915745 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6915746 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6915747 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6915748 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6915749 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6915750 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6915751 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6915752 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6915753 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6915754 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6915755 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6915756 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6915757 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6915758 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6915759 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6915760 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6915761 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6915762 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6915763 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6915764 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6915765 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6915766 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6915767 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6915768 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6915769 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6915770 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6915771 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6915772 who are open to doing something on the production side
6915773 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6915774 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6915775 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6915776 finegan first selected interwoven eight years ago and our decision has continually been validated through interwovens ability to innovate and enhance their product line to fit the needs of this in increasingly complex industry
6915777 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6915778 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6915779 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6915780 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6915781 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

6915784 ohhh hes british right is that the guy who does mr bean
6915785 i wouldnt like to launch myself as the guy who just does funny characters he says on the phone from los angeles during a press junket for
6915786 i want to do funny interesting films play funny interesting roles and work with funny interesting people
6915787 hamlet 2 he portrays a director of a very different sort
6915788 i wanted to do something that was just a broadly funny movie says coogan who had been scratching around for such an opportunity for several years before landing
6915789 something that was laugh out loud funny but not brainless and those are hard to find
6915790 ive got plenty that i can do in the u k so im not hostage to having to work here all the time or just do stuff that comes along he explains im lucky in that i can be a bit more picky
6915791 hamlet 2 role was that it called for him to portray an american
6915792 theres an austerity to british comedy more than american comedy he says
6915793 its often about failure and i think american comedy ultimately has to be tied into some sort of success
6915794 thats where i get my news except of course for the mercury news
6915795 how did you know my one problem with junk food is cheez its
6915796 my mother loved them and i have to stay away from them im not tempted by chocolates or anything sweet but i have to watch out
6915797 my brother and i used to watch all the shows and we had all the action figures growing up we used to dress up like the wrestlers for halloween so its something that weve always enjoyed watching
6915798 my guilty pleasure is ebay the most comprehensive museum ever imagined
6915799 i try to find at least one item there for each show just check out the 1960s rolodex file in our production of doubt center stage on sister aloysius desk i love the idea that the perfect detail is actually available somewhere and i can search the entire country to find it
6915800 on the weekend i like to let my hair down what little i have left of it
6915801 and just be a regular guy blend in with the crowd im a relaxed rider where you put your leather jacket on and sit back its definitely freedom you feel like its just you and the elements its refreshing
6915802 thats a secret pleasure for me i dont even know exactly why i like it so much except that is has dench and she could gargle and id love it
6915803 my foodie friends would not be pleased but whenever i need a little lift maybe every three months or so i eat an entire tub of frozen cool whip its soothing its cold and i love it
6915804 if i can hit the gym between 12 and 1 my guilty pleasure is to reward myself for sweating by watching the e news and then the daily ten on the e channel at least i can honestly say ive never watched it just sitting down
6915805 ill eat anything kraft macaroni amp cheese im old school i like the kind with the powder i also like liverwurst or fried bologna sandwiches because my dad used to make them hes german but honestly i am surrounded by the other stuff at work so when i get home i like to keep it simple

6915807 i love horror films not just because i crave the goose bump factor of a good evisceration but also because horror is one of the most metaphorically rich genres of the postmodern age
6915808 horror is an allegory for existence teeth takes a bite out of sexism in society the last winter fast forwards to the rising tide of global warming even the granddaddy of modern monster movies jaws indicts the pettiness of business interests determined to keep the beaches open no matter whats in the water horror intimately reflects who we are what we want and what scares the capri pants off us from hamlet to hostel horror is as fundamental to human existence as comedy and tragedy its like beckett only with disemboweling whats not to love
6915809 nobody even seems that interested in my life in america or that ive just arrived from new york city
6915810 the magic of discovering something new about ones spouse as well as the opposite sex each day every day at least for a few years
6915811 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6915812 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6915813 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6915814 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6915815 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6915816 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline

6915819 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

6915860 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6915861 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6915862 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6915863 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

6915873 this report makes clear that too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and avoid paying their fair share in the united states

6915877 thats 0 28 percent which is 90 times less than the figure reported by the ap policymakers and the public should not be deceived by this story that misrepresents the gao report

6915895 once that genie is out of the bottle there is no getting it back in
6915896 weve got terribly big challenges now whether it be housing or employment its very very tough times its very tough but were still the most innovative the most productive the greatest exporter the greatest importer
6915897 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6915898 but ive respected the process from day one and i want to continue to do that today and allow any details about the process and final decisions to be made by and their campaign not by anybody else
6915899 i am not in that arena this is his decision and i respect him to make it however he thinks is best for him and the country
6915900 i think its a fair assessment that ive done more than anybody else in my position
6915901 maybe mccain thinks this economy is working for folks like him
6915902 theres only one person whos going make that decision and thats sen obama and im going to respect that
6915903 the obama campaign would say weve spent 18 months doing
6915904 you sit here with the radio the tv the computer and i am not getting any work done
6915905 presidential races are close and we expect this one to be no different
6915906 but they should figure out how to spin the fact that owns a dozen houses and thinks the fundamentals of our economy are strong before trying to spin our convention
6915907 in arizona the only way to get around the state is by small private plane
6915908 the only explanation that makes sense is that he really does have a surprise pick or hes trying to convince someone to join the ticket
6915909 im of the view that at this point waiting is a good thing
6915910 obviously the announcements going to get a lot of attention but its very important to build interest for the convention the closer the announcement is to the convention the more newsy the convention is
6915911 this time you had the olympics intruding and not getting a sustained ride but having it peter out
6915912 things move so quickly that the inevitable negative front would have come in 48 hours in this case the convention occurring within 48 hours will cut off the inevitable scrutiny of the vice presidential pick
6915913 every day that goes by not only do you step on your own message but you forfeit the opportunity to have a candidate hitting four media markets a day
6915914 every dollar spent on candidate travel is much more highly leveraged than candidate ads so theyre giving all that up by waiting this long
6915915 he wanted to create buzz and thats exactly what he did
6915916 im in california everyones pulling out their cell phones hoping they want to be the first to know
6915917 there has been anticipation for days that the vice presidential announcement would happen toward the end of the week
6915918 we may wait until wednesday and do it right at the convention
6915919 its sort of like a long movie about the civil war we know who won if they did it friday evening at 5 30 they would dominate the evening news olympics or no olympics if they do it tomorrow it will dominate tomorrow and sunday and well move on as we go into the convention but it doesnt matter a whit to the outcome of the election i think we are consumed by this here we are sitting here talking about it
6915920 the obama campaign has been masterful in building suspense and then like any good production there has to be a payoff at the end
6915921 they have done a masterful job in owning the media attention over the pick and understanding the presss fascination and obsession with the processes
6915922 a lot of the success of this is based on stagecraft the first 24 to 48 hours is the crucial period in informing the publics conception of the pick
6915923 the attention span of the media has gotten so short now that you cant drive a vice presidential pick for a week
6915924 the story gets more and more absurd every four years its underwhelming by definition
6915925 absent an inexplicable lapse in judgment these picks when all is said and done are never the most important things that happen during the campaign
6915926 they might have delayed it one day because they were enjoying the mccain house meltdown

6915942 there will come a time when the whole world speaks the georgian language
6915943 freedom plays an immense role in georgian culture whereas the key russian concept is superpower
6915944 the czechs and slovaks never shot anyone they also had no territorial disputes and they had never sent a tank into anywhere the only thing which connects the invasion of georgia with that of czechoslovakia in 1968 was that both involved a russian attack this is the nature of russian politics what the russians need is something like a french revolution which ultimately brought democracy if you look at the russian revolution and russian history it is clear that we have to give them time but we should not let them out of our sight

6915992 no offense to anybody else but its important to have a guy thats been there that has the confidence of the team not just on offense but the whole football team thats been with you for a long time and is a great leader
6915993 we went out and made changes and found what we call our kind of guys guys that have high football character that understand what it means to compete sunday after sunday
6915994 i know i keep saying this but i like this football team weve got the right guys

6916010 a certain concept of freedom which has widespread support in public opinion at present diverts attention from ethical responsibilities appeal is made today to freedom alone it is often said what matters is to be free released from all constraint or limitation so as to operate according to private judgment which in reality is often pure caprice this much is clear such liberalism can only be described as primitive its influence however is potentially devastating
6916011 we must ask how this common treasury of the human race the treasury of so many different cultures can be built up over time and we must ask how best to respect the proper relationship between economics and culture in deference to the overwhelming power of one sided market forces it matters little in fact whether this kind of tyranny is imposed by marxist totalitarianism or by western liberalism

6916015 fannie and freddie had nothing to do with the explosion of high risk lending a few years ago an explosion that dwarfed the s amp l fiasco in fact fannie and freddie after growing rapidly in the 1990s largely faded from the scene during the height of the housing bubble
6916016 partly thats because regulators responding to accounting scandals at the companies placed temporary restraints on both fannie and freddie that curtailed their lending just as housing prices were really taking off also they didnt do any subprime lending because they cant the definition of a subprime loan is precisely a loan that doesnt meet the requirement imposed by law that fannie and freddie buy only mortgages issued to borrowers who made substantial down payments and carefully documented their income
6916017 you could say that the fannie freddie experience shows that regulation works
6916018 village voice article doesnt know what it is talking about
6916019 internal documents show that even late in the housing bubble fannie mae was drawn to risky loans by a variety of temptations including the desire to increase its market share and fulfill government quotas for the support of low income borrowers

6916021 what belongs to the world literature has its place in the consciousness of all
6916022 the difference between a literary work of art and any other text is not so fundamental
6916023 the nearest i have yet got to an answer is that we seek an enlargement of our being we want to be more than ourselves each of us by nature sees the whole world from one point of view with a perspective and a selectiveness peculiar to himself and even when we build disinterested fantasies they are saturated with and limited by our psychology to acquiesce in this particularity on the sensuous level in other words not to discount perspective would be lunacy we should then believe that the railway line really grew narrower as it receded into the distance but we want to escape the illusions of perspective on higher levels too we want to see with other eyes to imagine with other imaginations to feel with other hearts as well as with our own
6916024 literary criticism is the discussion between equals of works of literature with a view to establishing common ground on which judgements of value can be based
6916025 literature is a function of being intellectually preserved and handed down and therefore brings its hidden history into every age

6916033 advocates for greater federal funding of embryonic stem cell research are worried that john mccain will do an about face on the controversial issue if he wins the presidency
6916034 rep mike castle del the chief republican sponsor of stem cell bills vetoed by president bush said he wasnt sure whether a president mccain would sign stem cell research legislation
6916035 wed be hopeful that hed leave bushs policy in place
6916036 based on his votes in the senate the answer to that is yes
6916037 predicted mccain would not act of his own volition he would probably wait for congress he said
6916038 maintained that obama is more dedicated to the issue and noted he would act swiftly to rescind bushs policy
6916039 and just to make it absolutely clear that the term pro life has no political value whatsoever you might want to take into consideration the following comment by another so called pro life contender senator john mccain
6916040 it also quotes pro life groups as well as material from mccains website and recent statements by mccain himself in making the case for a possible change what the import of all this is i will leave each to judge for himself

6916291 in his message to the church in china the holy father attempted to address both those who have heroically resisted the persecutions and continued their clandestine existence absolutely excluding any contact with the chinese civil authorities as well as those who despite having made too many compromises have tried to take advantage of the meager space measured out carefully which the political authorities offered
6916292 it is difficult to assess from the outside the thin line that exists between a cowardly retreat from a prophetic stand and prudence to keep what can be saved in face of oppression
6916293 the holy father has invited both groups without condemning anyone to overcome their lack of mutual trust and build the unity of the body of christ on the basis of forgiveness and reconciliation and unity with the universal church
6916294 has carefully avoided launching quick accusations and has abstained from passing a moral judgment of condemnation emphasizing the fact that in moral assessments it is necessary to take into account the true intentions of a person who makes difficult prudential decisions
6916295 the fundamental principle according to which in all moral acts in addition to the objective light that comes from the moral law both the personal consideration made by the agents reason as well as the agents interior intention are of decisive significance will be useful we hope when it comes to reading recent history and to overcoming the climate of suspicion and mistrust that life often engenders under totalitarian regimes
6916296 the assessment of thorny issues considered in the context of external oppression calls above all for respect sympathy and a feeling of compassion toward those who were forced to act in the face of impossible dilemmas only in a climate of respect and understanding will the wounds caused by persecution fear and suspicion come to be cured
6916297 words of caution so that grave injustices will not be committed on the part of those who living in a different social context apply simplistic criteria in their easy condemnations
6916298 it is necessary as john paul ii said in his may 2006 address to priests in warsaw cathedral to sincerely practice penance for past infidelities avoiding arrogant judgment of past generations who lived in another time and in other circumstances
6916299 is aware that reconciliation cannot be effected from one day to the next prayer and patience are needed
6916300 the holy father inspires hope and wishes to touch the hearts of people so that change can take place
6916301 no matter how serious the limitations to freedom are people must choose in fact the fidelity of catholics in china at the cost of great sufferings is much praised in the letter
6916302 a charity with which the pope requests reconciliation and forgiveness and a clarity with which he states that the church in china must be built on the rock of peter through the bishops communion with the pope
6916303 touches the crucial point of the problem the original cause of the rupture of unity
6916304 in recent years the church has enjoyed greater religious freedom than in the past but there still are great limitations which are harmful for the church and of no advantage for the state

6916327 it is probable that of his personality less is known popularly than of that of any of the three grant sherman and thomas who with meade comprise the four union army commanders whose responsibilities and service in behalf of the union was greatest
6916328 general meade was a most accomplished officer he had been thoroughly educated in his profession and had a complete knowledge of both the science and the art of war in all its branches

6916505 the social effect in schools is that i dont think children are learning the skills of taking turns deciding whos it organizing their own games i think in not having recess children are not engaged as well in the classroom
6916506 as children are less engaged in physical play and being active they are gaining weight

6916519 in case you missed it this week there was a tragedy in kansas ten thousand people died an entire town destroyed
6916520 over the last 15 months weve traveled to every corner of the united states ive now been in 57 states i think one left to go

6916524 we need to get our pride back in the fact that the country is richer fairer and more confident than 10 years ago
6916525 we will only get the space to defend our record if we are clear about what hasnt worked as well as what has
6916526 our arts and cultural organisations have so much to give
6916527 we need to work on that vision hone its components put it into more accessible language and show the public that we can build on the start we have made i think we can and will succeed

6916542 you can let the suspense build and build if youve got a hillary or a gore socked away somewhere possibly a biden or a webb or some unorthodox pick like a general or a republican but youd better not come with jack reed or evan bayh after toying with people for over a week

6916545 se detect opacidad complejidad y confusi n en las inversiones de pemex en acciones de empresas nacionales y extranjeras las cuales tienen m ltiples fines de las cuales 21 de ellas no son transparentes no rinde cuentas y sus resultados no son revelados con suficiencia en la cuenta p blica federal
6916546 regule la ilegal actividad desplegada por la defensa y en consecuencia se limite la actividad de los consultores t cnicos
6916547 la presencia en la pr ctica de las experticias comporta un derecho innegable que es inherente a la persona que se le haya dado tal cualidad lo que no resulta permisible es que se pretenda sustituir al experto designado y se procure la manipulaci n de la evidencia para la realizaci n de una experticia propia
6916548 con ello se afectar a de manera directa la credibilidad de la investigaci n cient fica y por ende la obtenci n de la verdad como fin ltimo del proceso
6916549 what we have put together is a kind of one stop shopping opportunity for customers to install solar systems with no out of pocket expenses
6916550 certainly with this interest rate there will be opportunities for customers to save money on a monthly basis
6916551 our goal is to achieve or exceed compliance with the requirement
6916552 in the past weve had finance entities weve worked with but we have referred customers to those entities and they would negotiate rates
6916553 that will be the big trigger point if this thing is going to be a success
6916554 aps is doing what i as an installer think should be done to get things moving forward
6916555 aps has gone from being not very progressive in their rebates to being one of the best in the country in the last six months
6916556 but do most people do it for that reason no
6916557 what you can do is lock your utility rate in for the next 30 years or so
6916558 obviously we want to look at the interest rates and fine print in the contracts
6916559 assuming its reasonable this opens the door to a lot of people without a program where this can be financed youre leaving it to just the most wealthy people to take advantage
6916560 we wanted to get people to step up to the plate and start doing some things
6916561 im out in the coffee shops meeting the people one at a time that is what its going to take to win this race i think
6916562 the questions are number one why are you running for office and immediately before that is what are you nuts
6916563 they say to me look the board of supervisors in san francisco has become a zoo present parties excepted
6916564 the main problem that were experiencing in san francisco is a very very basic issue
6916565 and that is can the people that are entrusted with making the laws in san francisco can these people get along and figure out ways to use the legislative process not for personal political reasons not for pay back not for any of that
6916566 but rather to use the legislative authority and power that they have to forward policy in san francisco for the betterment of san franciscans
6916567 i dont think the board of supervisors has been doing that and i want to be elected in order to bring a fresh face to san francisco politics to see if we can figure out ways and solutions you know a lot of supervisors from the far left to the far right have some great ideas
6916568 but these ideas are getting lost in some of the venom and in some of the personal ideologies some of the personalities
6916569 small business needs to be revitalized not just in north beach and not just in district 3 not just at fishermans wharf but throughout san francisco
6916570 if you walk up columbus avenue you will see five boarded up storefronts in the heart of north beach
6916571 science is more influential and relevant to our daily lives than ever before and natural history museums can and must deal head on with the issues of the 21st century
6916572 our goal is to create a new facility that will not only hold powerful exhibits but serve as one itself inspiring visitors to conserve natural resources and help sustain the diversity of life on earth
6916573 with the new academy we are creating a museum that is visually and functionally linked to its natural surroundings metaphorically lifting up a piece of the park and putting a building underneath
6916574 we are excited to collaborate with the academy on a project in which design and mission are so seamlessly integrated through sustainable architecture and innovative design we are adding a vital new element to golden gate park and expressing the academys dedication to environmental responsibility
6916575 they are opaque they are closed they are like a kingdom of darkness and you are trapped inside you dont see where you are but here we are in the middle of a beautiful park golden gate park so you want to look out and know where you are
6916576 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6916577 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6916578 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
6916579 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
6916580 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws
6916581 were trying to say what is the best way to approach this issue
6916582 whether the style of behavior demonstrated by a university president or a professor at a dinner or reception will be replicated by freshmen let loose at their first friday night keg party
6916583 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
6916584 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6916585 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6916586 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights
6916587 wed even raise a glass to him that is if we could
6916588 she wanted her picture taken and she was up on the ledge
6916589 her sandal got caught thats when i saw my mom trip over a rock and i saw my mom fall forward
6916590 buona partita contro una squadra che fa ottimo possesso palla
6916591 when i was given the chance to do my illustrated movie i wanted to put in things from my personal life and give my fans an inside look at me
6916592 the directors of the video let me shoot a lot of the footage and that was awesome
6916593 me and the girls basically hung out in a hotel room and made out with each other for a few hours and filmed it it was a lot of fun
6916594 sono arrivate le multem elevate con solerzia e rigore dai vigili urbani in una strada ubicata fuori dal centro storico sicuramente non percorsa dai turisti e dove i panni stesi sulla facciata degli edifici sono brutti ma sicuramente non fanno scandalo
6916595 they shut it down after the bubble burst even though they could have kept growing it for just the cost of the servers
6916596 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
6916597 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
6916598 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
6916599 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
6916600 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
6916601 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
6916602 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
6916603 we had a concern that this was going to happen
6916604 it was just kind of a strange sensation you know to eat with one tooth missing it kept me from being at 100 percent efficiency
6916605 what is no 1 for me is just making a personal best to just improve my performance over last year
6916606 la sensibilidad de nuestra instituci n hacia la uni n c vico militar es tiempo de que el pueblo entienda que los militares no somos una casta nuestra raz n se ser es el servicio a los civiles

6916609 i want us to go into this with our eyes wide open i read a lot about kids who make connections under their parents noses that then prove harmful so i want us to go very very slowly with this and ensure that we can help keep a safe as long as possible i m happy erring on the side of paranoia in this instance

6916613 you dont need to know yoga but you need core strength
6916614 fitness like literacy improves the quality of life so i guess thats what motivates me to teach both english and aerial yoga
6916615 in circus arts its about perfection what it looks like but in yoga its what you feel like
6916616 aerial yoga is playful but mindful you have to be in tune with your body when you are doing it
6916617 even though i want to believe its for everyone its just not
6916618 staging your comeback a complete beauty revival for women over 45
6916619 a lot of women figure out what works in their 20s and early 30s but those things all change
6916620 but you dont really have the time or interest to go back to glamour magazine and read all the articles i give women the tools and techniques for their second act
6916621 this is where you tell me how i dont know how thin fine and stick straight your hair is
6916622 i do but no you shouldnt need one if you have the right haircut
6916623 hair should be in proportion to your face and to the rest of you save the very big or the very flat hair for the very young and proportionate balanced fullness and shape will help lift an aging face and body
6916624 youre always pulling it back and rarely wear it down you keep fluffing it whenever you look in the mirror
6916625 having your brows tweezed where you need less and penciled or powdered where you need more will make the biggest difference not only now but as you age next to a good bra its the best thing you can do for a lift
6916626 bright or dark lipstick is aging soft natural and pale lips are more youthful
6916627 next time youre wearing a low cut top look straight in the mirror and cross your arms if you dont see crepe paper crinkling give yourself the cleavage permit if you see excessive vertical lines its time to rethink
6916628 goldie hawn there is a tipping point to cosmetic help and shes kind of well tipped id love to see who goldie has become rather than a repeat version of who she used to be
6916629 the biggest mistake is women who dont do enough they dont wear any makeup and dont do anything to their hair in florida they do too much its all about balance balancing your hair and your makeup and your clothes to your body type and to who you are now
6916630 they had called us and just took us under their wings so to speak
6916631 we had to tear out the drywall we had to tear out carpet basically everything from this lower level had to come out and it was trash
6916632 everyday theres been a blessing that gods bestowed upon us
6916633 this was a surprise for us that we were going to get these funds so we decided that god blessed us with that and were going to bless someone else
6916634 it made us realize how fortunate we really are to have all this and even this just everything we could have
6916635 theres only a couple of teams that get to play there and when i heard we got to play there i actually didnt believe it at first so the saying here is

6916646 motorcycle racing is a real world physics lab where the penalty for wrong answers is a lot more dramatic than a bad grade
6916647 every object persists in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed on it
6916648 this will happen until the rider runs out of track or other forces become nonnegligible such as wind resistance
6916649 all that excess energy has to be dissipated by the brakes in the form of heat
6916650 nothing that ever happens on a motorcycle breaks the laws of physics in fact motorcycles are excellent examples of just how well physics works
6916651 weve found that its much easier to throw these pitches and observe the results by throwing a styrofoam ball
6916652 a fictitious force also called a pseudo force 1 or dalembert force 2 is an apparent force that acts on all masses in a non inertial frame of reference such as a rotating reference frame the force f does not arise from any physical interaction but rather from the acceleration a of the non inertial reference frame itself due to newtons second law f ma fictitious forces are always proportional to the mass m being acted upon

6916665 im sitting there watching the first offense and i got a smile and thought hey this is really cool ive got a quarterback
6916666 no offense to anybody else but its important to have a guy thats been there that has the confidence of the team not just on offense but the whole football team thats been with you for a long time and is a great leader
6916667 we went out and made changes and found what we call our kind of guys guys that have high football character that understand what it means to compete sunday after sunday
6916668 i know i keep saying this but i like this football team weve got the right guys
6916669 we really do we got better by addition but mainly we got better by subtraction through this off season were doing the right things
6916670 i think were a lot further along this year than we were last year at this point
6916671 getting moose back this off season was huge not only for myself but for the running game and for steve smith for the last couple of years it has been a one man show its very simple steve was a one man show and we had to get on his coattails and let him take us as far as we could
6916672 im very excited what we can do offensively i think the passing game we can do some extremely good things but im anxious to watch running backs deangelo williams and jonathan stewart run im anxious to see their ability
6916673 i think this will be a true test against washington to really see their abilities but were light years ahead up front on the line than we have been in recent years
6916674 as yall know i came from chicago where we had a pretty good defense i like this defense better than chicagos
6916675 if you dont set that goal then what are you playing for
6916676 i think this year its our team goal and guys are working toward that
6916677 this tool is a critical first step in helping hospitals evaluate their disaster plans to find out what works and what doesnt

6916712 but i did read a lot of british comics when i was very young the stuff was weird in hindsight a football strip called billys boots about a young lad possessed by a dead footballer whenever he tied up the laces on his old boots
6916713 if i said it was a commentary on violence id be sniggering at the same time because lets face it when you write a scene about a bullet taking four panels to pass through a human head you arent thinking about the social commentary
6916714 you just think it looks fucking cool real violence is obviously horrible but these are comic characters or highly paid actors its great watching bad shit happen to them
6916715 moore said all that after finding his greatest success with watchmen one of the darkest books of his generation theres a certain guilt that seems to hit creators after taking these characters to the max but the weird truth is that the greatest sales and greatest excitement comes from the dark stuff my own experience is that the darker you make the material the more popular it is both creatively and commercially who am i but a humble writer i cant argue with the readers

6916717 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
6916718 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed

6916720 it could be like something out of a greek myth
6916721 not having a major fault is not a reason not to worry about earthquakes
6916722 instead of having a single major fault or a few major faults we tend to have a lot of very minor and sort of subtle faults
6916723 its a family of faults and that can contribute to the severity of an earthquake
6916724 i try to keep that as independent from my work as possible
6916725 a purely circumstantial speculative argument but while its speculative its within the scientific bounds of reason
6916726 may very well be among the safest places to go during a seismic event
6916727 potential causes of higher mortality in elderly users of conventional and atypical antipsychotic medications
6916728 if we treat all of the lettuce and spinach then theres going to be a very rare instance of exposure to illness causing microorganisms
6916729 whats sad is that the fda after a nearly nine year review selected only two products involved with the massive illnesses in 2006
6916730 i suspect it will take awhile for the supply chain to get into place because of the limited number of irradiation facilities in place in the u s
6916731 these facilities are relatively expensive to build so you have to make sure you have adequate product flow and a market for that product
6916732 it would have to be new construction thats for sure
6916733 we wouldnt expect any immediate adoption and in fact industry wont move forward unless they are sure there wont be a backlash from consumer activists the other issue is that there is a lot more product now being labeled organic and you cannot irradiate products labeled organic
6916734 theres been a lot of research done on that and basically products that have treated with irradiation are as good or better after 14 days typical travel time than those that havent
6916735 we now know that in order to kill e coli on this type of product we can turn down the dosage level the power of the beam effectively and lettuce and spinach remain just as crisp and wholesome as if you grew it yourself
6916736 the american consumer has shown willingness to purchase irradiated products such as strawberries and meats once consumers understand the food safety implications their unfounded worries about the safety of the cold pasteurization process are eliminated even though there are a lot of naysayers and anti irradiation people giving inaccurate information
6916737 the experience with ground beef is that consumers have not reacted negatively to the label
6916738 the only negative reaction is to price it costs more
6916739 in 2006 there were an estimated 50 billion servings of green leafy salads served in this country and there were approximately 1 200 people made ill
6916740 the odds of getting a food borne illness from produce are already extremely low based upon the number of servings that we see but what we have to recognize is that irradiation is one more tool we can use to ensure the safety of our products this is especially important for at risk populations immune compromised folks pregnant women children under the age of eight and elderly these people are at high risk for food borne illness and it may be useful to feed them greens that have been irradiated for that last margin of safety
6916741 the real importance of this rule is that produce companies wouldnt even look at the technology unless the government approved it the new fda rule makes them more inclined to take a fresh look at it

6916756 i did have health insurance when i was going to school but i stopped going to the u about a year ago now
6916757 a students private health insurance information is subject to periodic audits providing inaccurate or false information may result in unexpected charges and is a violation of the student conduct code
6916758 we get better rates overall by having a mandatory insurance plan
6916759 you have to weigh individual benefits versus community benefits its best for the entire community because we can keep the rates low
6916760 even if people think theyre invulnerable they still need insurance students say they cant afford it but by not having insurance they could end up in bankruptcy
6916761 right now the federal government isnt doing much to address this problem

6916935 the piece is a great conversation starter with the local proletariat
6916936 i use it to demonstrate how obama is all about change and unity and cutting edge postmodern sculpture and how he will fund public arts programs to bring it to their dismal little hellhole towns

6916948 from march to august of 07 through postponed announcement days staff changes firings resignations and general disarray the thompson camp was stunned by the incredibly positive response and didnt really know how to manage it the trial balloon soared mighty high and he found himself being dragged into a race that he was not even sure how to run
6916949 i dont think its fair that those parents who are abiding by the law and they pay their taxes then all the other parents need to pay their taxes also
6916950 to not know if youre gonna have a job one week to the next week to the next month just keep threatening the fact you may not have a job just adds to the stress level
6916951 ive been trying to make calls try to set things up let the officers know they need to get out and try to set some kind of backup system just in case something happens where were not going to be able to stay here

6916958 we heard about picking up teenagers 13 and 15 year old hitchhikers and mutilating them
6916959 there is no action but there is nothing other than what was alleged that there was a distribution of a web link
6916960 she wanted her picture taken and she was up on the ledge

6916963 we need to promote sports in the country and for this we want to make a stadium in nizampur which will boast a boxing ring a wrestling area cycling track and a ground for football since these sports do not have the required infrastructure especially in remote areas the entire project is likely to cost us upto rs 5 crore and will take around two years to build but we cannot sustain such a stadium on our own and would look for some private organisation or sports federation to take up the job of its maintainence
6916964 what is ironic is that stadiums made by us in the city are hardly put to use for instance barely 60 to 80 matches take place at ambedkar stadium in a year there is a lot of talent in the country and it is just a matter of giving it opportunity to prove its metal we want to provide similar facilities in all villages surrounding delhi
6916965 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6916966 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6916967 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
6916968 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
6916969 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws
6916970 were trying to say what is the best way to approach this issue
6916971 whether the style of behavior demonstrated by a university president or a professor at a dinner or reception will be replicated by freshmen let loose at their first friday night keg party
6916972 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
6916973 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6916974 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6916975 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights
6916976 wed even raise a glass to him that is if we could

6916981 in a series of eye movement studies we showed that social experience has an impact on how people look at faces specifically we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in westerners and east asian observers we found that westerners tend to look at specific features on an individuals face such as the eyes and mouth whereas east asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features one possible cause of this could be that direct or excessive eye contact may be considered rude in east asian cultures
6916982 but maybe eye contact is more than a little over rated

6916984 well im calling from canada can you tell me what his new number is
6916985 both sides use slander to attempt to win but is it the right thing to do ill vote for the man i feel is the best i have to vote for whichever one wins by the will of the people will be my president i will most likely not be very pleased with either and i promise to speak against the things the winner does wrong and give him credit for the things he does right
6916986 bush used cocaine clinton smoked pot who cares what they did as kids personally i wouldnt want a president who had been a teetotaler his her entire life

6916988 i think obama acquitted himself well under the circumstances he was honest and candid and thats going to matter to a number of christians
6916989 obama is the antichrist and his birth certificate is forged
6916990 judge not lest ye be judged see ya in hell my friend
6916991 first of all i dont believe in the antichrist after going through a century with hitler pol pot stalin and maybe a dozen other despicable players i find it disingenuous to even have an asinine article like this
6916992 i have it on good authority that he is actually the tooth fairy
6916993 and the libs are still thinking dialog will solve every problem take a good look at georgia and lets run over there and chat with putin
6916994 georgia initiated this conflict by a military assault on russian peacekeepers and by bombing the capital of south ossetia they bought the ticket and now theyre taking the ride
6916995 this whole rumor was started by obama operatives when their guy didnt do well they needed spin to attack mccain with a story they feel their guy needs to hit a home run every time
6916996 just because mccain is an ex pow and professes to be a christian does not mean that he cant be a lying deceitful weasel
6916997 obama did just ok and mccain did better than ok not great i give obama credit for accepting the invitation it took a lot of what jesse jackson wanted to remove from obama for him to enter that forum
6916998 what are the odds that two people in the same century drew a cross in the ground gosh hundreds of millions of christians millions of interactions with other cultures

6917033 you cannot define mendis under existing bowling categories as his fingers work differently to that of a regular leg spin or off spin bowler
6917034 i wondered why no one had detected the similarity in his finger work to that of a carom player
6917035 by the time iverson went to war as an ack ack anti aircraft gunner
6917036 the finger had become prodigiously strong and in games of french cricket that he and his comrades played using a ping pong ball and a ruler he found he spun the ball enormous distances he coiled the finger beneath the ball held it in place with the base of the thumb then flicked it out as though in a game of marbles
6917037 iversons hand at delivery looked like a but his stock ball was a wrong un players brought up traditionally struggled to adapt to such a heterodox idea
6917038 its very very difficult even gleeson struggled with it ive discussed the ball with shane warne he told me that his coach terry jenner had tried to develop an iverson style ball but warne could only bowl it over 11 yards
6917039 there may come a time when mendis would be unravelled the onus is on him to be a step ahead of the batsmen his partner in crime muralitharan is a fine specimen of a bowler who has evolved

6917051 this basic intervention implementing a household smoking ban has the potential to promote antismoking norms and to prevent adolescent smoking
6917052 this study provides evidence that even in a smoke free home environment parental behavior remains a strong influence on teen smoking attitudes and behavior
6917053 these bans send a strong message to teens that its not ok to smoke and in the face of so many other external factors that may influence teens to smoke peers advertising a home smoking policy is one thing that parents can control to some extent

6917059 chemical biomarkers may eventually serve as objective clinical markers of disease if effective sensor technology can be developed
6917060 within a second it can take a measurement and tell you whether or not its cancer
6917061 and you can move the probe around quickly to different spots of the skin
6917062 it can tell if the structures of the cells and the biochemicals present are associated with the progression of these cancers
6917063 many biopsies and surgeries would be unnecessary if you had a device that could catch the cancer earlier and identify the margins of where it exists
6917064 people think that if they take a medication their body absorbs it and it disappears but of course thats not the case
6917065 it brings a question to peoples minds that if the fish were affected might there be a potential problem for humans
6917066 pharmaceuticals are only present in very low concentrations and therefore could not be dangerous
6917067 septic systems are essentially small treatment plants that are essentially unmanaged and therefore tend to fail
6917068 i think its a shame that so much money is going into monitoring to figure out if these things are out there and so little is being spent on human health
6917069 they need to just accept that these things are everywhere every chemical and pharmaceutical could be there its time for the epa to step up to the plate and make a statement about the need to study effects both human and environmental
6917070 these are chemicals that are designed to have very specific effects at very low concentrations
6917071 thats what pharmaceuticals do so when they get out to the environment it should not be a shock to people that they have effects
6917072 i want to thank the legislature for stabilizing malpractice rates for the short term thereby ensuring that our doctors can continue to provide quality care in new york without getting suffocated by more back breaking fiscal burdens
6917073 that will give us more time to work out new reforms and solutions to this complex problem that is in the best interests of everyone that would be impacted
6917074 our methods have the potential for providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on

6917114 this was my response to the chaotic confusion in the construction industry

6917129 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
6917130 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
6917131 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
6917132 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
6917133 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
6917134 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
6917135 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
6917136 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
6917137 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
6917138 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
6917139 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
6917140 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
6917141 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write

6917162 midnight represents the passing of the latest deadline for russia to pull back its troops
6917163 since 16 august russia has made three public commitments to withdraw its forces
6917164 the reports of russian military withdrawal appear to be a step forward to implement these commitments but i remain deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the pre august 7 position as agreed
6917165 it is imperative that russian forces fully and speedily implement and abide by the commitments that it has made
6917166 as far as stepping down i did say it is public knowledge that i will be going some time this year and that is still what i will be doing
6917167 but it is nothing to do with a comment on government or anything else
6917168 the steady flow of national guard orders has provided cyberlux with both market share within the national guard community as well as an additional revenue and production stream in preparation for the 8 million in requirements we have already received from the united states air force
6917169 the manufacturing and logistics planning that has gone into our production model for the variety of tactical lighting systems contained in the 8 million commitment has been tedious and time consuming but enabling this capability was necessary in order to ensure the seamless rollout of such a large incremental military order we have experienced suppliers in place our facility is equipped and our employees are excited to deliver on such a large opportunity we expect full delivery of all current military orders by early 2009
6917170 lighting science is honored to be part of new york citys project to test long lasting eco friendly lights to illuminate our world renowned streets and boroughs
6917171 we are proud to play an integral role in realizing this important carbon reduction goal we expect this project will herald a new era of led adoption and the continued greening of new york city
6917172 the new streetlight is the first of its kind and will set the new standard of lighting for city streets worldwide
6917173 the long lasting properties of led technology enhances security minimizes maintenance and the energy savings can be considerable as the technology develops rather than outdating itself in 20 years the lighting solution can evolve with technology and improve with age becoming less costly and consuming less energy over time

6917195 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6917196 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6917197 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6917198 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6917199 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6917200 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions

6917221 from floor to ceiling there are these 20ft high walls covered with tiles like wallpaper with their jewel tones they are reminiscent of our traditional minakari enamelling work and almost have a three dimensional feel to them
6917222 we sent teams all over the country places such as baroda udaipur the south over a two year period and they procured the tiles from old havelis and houses that were being pulled down they were mostly used in hearths and the walls
6917223 there were only two kilns in india during the colonial times in saurashtra and gwalior which actually makes the decorative tiles on sale from these kilns rarer and therefore more valuable
6917224 ill put them at home where i can benefit from the good vibrations
6917225 mounted on a centre table with a glass top it was exquisite
6917226 you will find them on a lot of old parsi furniture in mumbai
6917227 after all this time the tiles still retain their original colour
6917228 iznik in turkey has been a centre of tile making for a few thousand years now
6917229 and tiles are still made the same way there and then lacquered and hand painted

6917236 soccer has not made ronaks body flexible and agile or given him more stamina and a better sense of focus all of which i think yoga can
6917237 although childrens bodies are not completely developed to do complicated poses the basic asanas make them flexible and if done regularly can help them concentrate
6917238 unlike dance or sports which are fun activities children view yoga with trepidation until they try it out
6917239 at the start if too much emphasis is laid on the correctness of postures and breathing techniques children lose interest
6917240 children cant appreciate that yoga is not just a physical exercise but a way of life
6917241 there are no abrupt changes in postures and stances and everytime something new is thrown in to keep them interested
6917242 most school instructors teach yoga in unimaginative ways children are made to do the same postures over and over again in a rigid textbook like format
6917243 we choose not to help you we dont have time for that
6917244 its pushed out a few bears especially after the news in british land
6917245 the real issue for the group is how long will the recovery take and whether the banks will be supportive
6917246 we see a rights issue as a distinct possibility interest cover looks low and with debt due to be refinanced we believe lenders will only lend at much higher rates as such the market is likely to worry about covenants
6917247 avevas long standing experience and engineering expertise in its focus industries positions it attractively with few direct challengers
6917248 should remain intact as long as oil stays above 70 80 per barrel
6917249 this really does put a rate cut firmly on the agenda although it is unlikely to come until we have seen the peak in inflation
6917250 we now believe the bank is likely to start easing by year end already despite concerns about the near term inflation profile we had expected for some time that the bank of england will cut the bank rate to 4 0 per cent by the third quarter of 2009 we now add a further cumulative half percentage point of easing to take rates down to 3 50 per cent by end 2009
6917251 the revised gdp figures confirm that the office of national statistics original second quarter estimate was too optimistic the messages signalled by our quarterly survey were more realistic the figures show that manufacturing and construction declined in the second quarter and total gdp stagnated given the heightened threats of uk recession it is vital that the mpc starts cutting interest rates in october or nov ember as soon as it is clear that cpi inflation has peaked
6917252 the real test will be 2009 and what happens there
6917253 the two big factors are what the new president will do with the us economy and whether the slowdown will hit china and there are entirely mixed views about that
6917254 there are a number of events that make 2010 look much better
6917255 we saw a tightening in the second quarter in western europe and the us
6917256 there has also been a little bit of tightening in traditional advertising in the uk the us france germany and spain
6917257 gfk originally referred to a source of capital but we know the wealthy german hertz family are not prepared to support the bid and we also know gfk spent four days in the us trying to drum up capital and didnt manage it

6917261 the immunization were most worried about is the mmr it turns out that measles is a pretty contagious disease that causes serious injury its about one in 3 000 will have permanent injury a small number of kids will actually die from it
6917262 right now when you have an epidemic its like 25 kids
6917263 its under control in the dozens rather than the hundreds once you have unimmunized people it comes back
6917264 almost any stress can push them over the edge but measles would be even worse

6917269 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment add to this mix a jump in inflation in part the product of a global commodity boom and the result has been one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6917270 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next
6917271 my feeling is that they will have to be raised because inflation is going to be a problem the bank cannot do anything about oil prices and it cannot do anything about global food prices
6917272 but its got to make sure we dont get into a wage price cycle bringing back really high inflation and making any slowdown worse than it otherwise would be
6917273 there must be a strong chance now that output is falling that the uk has already entered a technical recession
6917274 i can confirm our growth estimate for 1999 of 1 per cent to 1 5 per cent which is what i told the house in november followed by stronger growth
6917275 today i can report that in 1999 instead of the recession that many forecast the british economy grew by 2 per cent and britain has been growing steadily while meeting our inflation target
6917276 britain is today experiencing the longest period of sustained economic growth since records began in the year 1701
6917277 i can report that after 10 years of sustained growth britains growth will continue into its 59th quarter the forecast end of the cycle and beyond
6917278 while other countries have suffered recessions the british economy has now been growing continuously for over a decade the longest period of sustained growth in our history
6917279 the benfield board believes that the offer provides benfields shareholders with fair and certain value
6917280 we have a lot to do and will have to deliver it in increasingly difficult economic circumstances
6917281 the real issue for the group is how long will the recovery take and whether the banks will be supportive
6917282 it would be folly to rule out a rights issue but it is not something i have so far considered
6917283 its even more complicated if you look at a phenomenon like you being really locked into these places and with that i mean basically its very hard to leave if you are there for a longer time imagine you are on myspace and you are running a blog there and you are uploading photos to flickr for many years you are on facebook every day and have 500 friends its very very hard to leave without leaving all this material including your friends behind because these companies make it impossible to take this material with you you cannot export it and this is the very core of the business plan of many of these companies so that i think makes it really a capture of community so you are in a way entrapped
6917284 i am an absolute news junkie i am keen to see on google alerts if travelodge or any of our competitors are in the news
6917285 i have been in the business 30 odd years and quite often i know when i walk in the door whether i think it is right or not
6917286 we do a lot of market research and one of the things i am always fascinated to read is how customers expectations are changing
6917287 it is a hotel we have been spending some money on it is a very popular property particularly at the weekend
6917288 we got straight on to the guy for the construction of the facility and got him to make sure that the contractor knew it was unacceptable to leave things like this
6917289 the hotel managers need to be focused on the things they are responsible for they do not have responsibility for the top line that is driven centrally but they do have responsibility for margins of the business and looking after their customers and people staff
6917290 we recognise that the hotel industry is fairly transient but we have many employees who have been there for more than 25 years
6917291 the office at the bridgend hotel is absolutely immaculate and of course the hotel is like the office there are only five staff in the hotel they obviously take enormous pride in their travelodge
6917292 we get a lot of managers from supermarkets such as tesco and sainsburys we would always prefer to hire from retailers than from a hotel company because often hotel people think they are stepping down from a four star to a budget and that is not what we want
6917293 everyone expects my hotel visit memos some of it is we are missing a trick here and where are the opportunities
6917294 if i lived in a cave and did not read newspapers looking at our numbers i would say no impact

6917302 glad to see youre finally awake this late in the day
6917303 thats one of my good soup bowls dont give it to that vile animal ill have to throw it out
6917304 ill have none of your nonsense this morning charlie here is very shaken up as we were both nearly just killed we came over here to calm down a bit and call the police
6917305 you arent still having some drinking party from last night are you
6917306 because if you are drunk right now ill have no time for you
6917307 karen and john just arrived and we are having a coffee before me and john go play racquetball down at the gym
6917308 you better have a seat here simon and tell us all about what happened this is my partner constable karen collins
6917309 well this is quite convenient having two police officers right here it will save me a telephone call
6917310 the reason i ask is that in my day we didnt see too many women constables the cops i am accustomed to are usually all men and also usually both mean and irish
6917311 i just graduated from the academy second in my class last month and am now a fully trained first class constable let me assure you that i am completely qualified and also if this helps i am also of irish decent
6917312 please tell us what has happened constable collins here will take down the details although we are both off duty we can still take the statement and call it in
6917313 old charlie and myself were just going out for our morning stroll and since it is such a beautiful morning we decided to go walking a new route well as we got just up here by the corner we decided to cross over 17th avenue using the crosswalk thats a very busy street to cross at the best of times you know
6917314 so anyway as we were half way through the intersection i noticed a blue car speeding towards us with no intentions of stopping or even slowing down charlie was on his leash about 6 feet ahead of me and i quickly pulled him back as the car whizzed through the intersection without a care in the world old charlie could have been killed
6917315 i looked at the driver who looked to be some young punk and he was eating a bowl of cereal as he was driving his car and didnt even see us
6917316 did you get a chance to see the license plate or vehicle type sir
6917317 i was so concerned with pulling old charlie out of harms way i really could not tell you much more other than the car was blue amp speeding towards downtown and the young punk driving it was eating a bowl of cereal and not paying attention whatsoever it is disgraceful
6917318 had he run charlie over the driver would have been considered a serial killer haha
6917319 you seem to have no sense at all about such serious matters it is no wonder you still are single no one wants a damn fool for a boyfriend or husband talking such nonsense when a serious crime has just been committed
6917320 we will put in the report however it is rather unlikely anything will come of this as we would require a full description of the vehicle to even have a starting point unless we can catch this driver in the act there is little we can do reckless driving and driving with undue care and attention is unfortunately very common these days
6917321 well you will at least follow up on the information i gave you
6917322 plus perhaps he was not full amp decided to have a second bowl he may still be driving around
6917323 you know crimes of this type would not be happening so frequently if you police would crack down more on the less serious petty crimes
6917324 you can bet a guy who gets in trouble with the petty crimes will be less likely to try anything more serious nip it in the bud early i say
6917325 they let me drive almost all the time right now but to reassure you operating a police vehicle is also part of our formal training
6917326 no offence young lady however i rarely even let my wife drive and weve been married well over fifty years and old charlie here has already been traumatized enough for one day
6917327 it looks like you have the honours in driving me and poor old charlie home we are both in no shape to walk back after almost being killed
6917328 i want you to make sure you drive with care and no speeding on the way home i know you have a tendency to have a lead foot however i think weve seen enough of that nonsense today all ready
6917329 and as for you john just because you are my boys good friend and a passenger in the car doesnt mean you cannot order him to pull over and issue him a ticket if he is driving reckless remember you still are a police officer

6917337 south florida has taken huge steps toward becoming a big time program the past two seasons consecutive 9 4 showings including wins last year against established programs like auburn and west virginia have earned the bulls a lot of respect talented players a growing fan base and tons of media attention have created a buzz for a program that operated out of a trailer in the beginning while some would take time out to bask in recent success the man who started the program is too busy keeping his team focused on improving
6917338 getting to the top is tough staying there is tougher
6917339 the south florida bulls were several hours removed from embarrassing interstate 4 rival ucf in a 64 12 pummeling that was about as competitive as a 20 second ultimate fighting bout as the espn talking heads were sorting out the events of the day the bulls were the talk of the college football nation from unranked and virtually unheard of when the season started usf had ascended to the top 10 and by virtue of the blowout was headed toward the top of the polls and smack in the middle of bowl championship series conversations
6917340 thats just the sort of challenge murphy was looking for when he chose usf over rutgers which is about an hours drive from his hometown of elizabeth n j
6917341 i couldve gone to rutgers west virginia and others myself i wanted to go and play in the south because they said thats where the best players are at
6917342 that patent incapacity is what has characterised his first 100 days in office giving them the inescapable hallmark of failure

6917344 the external challenges facing him are huge including as they do the challenge of solving irelands eu problem the challenge of a by election and of pivotal importance the challenge of creating an effective stimulus for the economy
6917345 its not just that people are increasingly coming under personal financial pressure theyre also baffled that none of this was anticipated by the people supposedly in charge and astonished that the government isnt doing something about it
6917346 the problem is that this government has been so long in power it has a diminished capacity to envisage anything different and has run out of imagination innovation and creativity
6917347 like a rabbit caught in headlights it does nothing sees no possibilities
6917348 the same tired puppet with the same people in the background jerking his strings
6917349 nobody in this country believes for a single moment that the dumbeldore of castlebar is capable of waving a magic wand that will instantly transform the irish economy while the rest of the western world remains gripped by the sharpest economic downturn in recent history
6917350 this extraordinary picture shows that prison security is a shambles and is another major embarrassment for the government it begs belief that a convicted knife murderer would be allowed access to a potentially lethal kitchen knife
6917351 everyone coming into the prison prisoners visitor and staff will have to pass through the new measures and all handbags briefcases clothing etc will be subject to screening
6917352 ill hate going to the shop to try to get the paper wont i ill need a hat and shades and a false nose and a moustache what have i done
6917353 this is where it has all led to i believe that there is no point in getting through those ropes if you arent going to give it all when i come out of there win or lose there will be nothing left nothing
6917354 we are going to continue our enforcement of immigration law whether it is convenient for people or whether its not convenient
6917355 congress has mandated that we enforce these laws and that is what we intend to do
6917356 it seems to me ice used this as nothing more than a publicity ploy as a means to justify their harsh enforcement of immigration law
6917357 the gestapo agents at the department of homeland security they are in charge
6917358 disparaging remark that communities are terrorized by ice immigration raids
6917359 its one thing to remark intelligently on the need for immigration reform
6917360 but its quite another to berate ice law enforcement officers who are risking their lives to enforce the laws passed by congress
6917361 these gestapo comments cross any line of decency and are an affront to the men and women at this agency who perform their sworn duties often at great personal risk
6917362 most troubling irresponsible comments like these vilifying law enforcement officers can have a significant impact on officer and public safety
6917363 if i win ill especially dedicate my success to rafa hes a very important per
6917364 the fbi states and also reported to the 9 11 commission that none of the recording devices from the two planes that hit the world trade center were ever recovered
6917365 strange that sheirer four oem deputies and a field responder went straight to the north tower rather than to the nearby emergency command center
6917366 t he command center was out of business from the outset
6917367 we the 9 11 commission tried to get a sense of what sheirer was really doing we tried to figure it out from the videos we couldnt tell everybody from oem was with him virtually the whole chain of command some of them should have been at the command center
6917368 i dont know what they were doing it was sheirers decision to go there on his own the command center would normally be the focus of a major event and that would be where i would expect the director to be
6917369 no rationale for sheirers prolonged lobby stay no information conveyed to commanders and no steps to coordinate the response
6917370 right before the south tower collapsed i noticed a lot of people just left the lobby and i heard we had a crew of all different people high level people in government everybody was gone almost like they had information that we didnt have
6917371 still planes unaccounted for that may be heading for new york
6917372 while the pakistani inter services public relations claimed that former isi director general lt gen mahmud ahmad sought retirement after being superseded on monday the truth is more shocking
6917373 the conditions in the wreckage were irrelevant for the conditions before the collapse
6917374 we have asked the pentagon to allow a six month timetable for submittal of proposals in this competition
6917375 the reason were asking for that is since the issuance of the draft request for proposal rfp two weeks ago as weve engaged in our discussions with the pentagon and theyre asking for a different kind of airplane than they asked for in the first competition
6917376 if we dont get the sufficient time to prepare that proposal theres really little option for us other than to no bid in this competition
6917377 this is a new competition make no mistake about that the requirements have changed
6917378 the proposal will have the specific timelines in it im not going to get into it now and whether or not a company desires to compete is entirely up to them
6917379 we have taken what the gao has told us what they have recommended for us to do which in the scheme of the overall proposal were relatively minor but important addressed all the concerns that the gao raised
6917380 it views any delay to the amended request for proposal for the tanker replacement program as harmful to the warfighter and that a delay will result in a direct escalation in cost to the government thereby harming american taxpayers
6917381 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6917382 the agreement decides the provisions that would arrange the temporal presence and the timetable for the u s troops mission
6917383 the iraqi government still have to revise the deal and we are waiting for them and will wait for the decision of the iraqi parliament

6917444 the commission still has no real power to require builders to make needed repairs
6917445 because homeowners must submit to this process before they may seek remedies in court those who fail to satisfy its requirements either out of confusion or frustration lose their access to court
6917446 no other regulatory agency has a program with such a potentially devastating effect on consumers ability to seek their own remedies
6917447 thus instead of addressing critical construction issues the majority of actions taken against builders were for failure to timely renew a license
6917448 only 12 percent of all closed state inspection cases have resulted in a satisfactory offer of repair or compensation
6917449 the very outcome the inspection process was enacted to prevent

6917572 all those who want to live in a healthy equal society should vote for the socialist alliance
6917573 the socialist alliance shares the ideology i fought for all my life people before profit and for peoples right to have a better future
6917574 by standing for election as a socialist alliance candidate we will open the door for other political refugees to participate fully in australian political life as australian citizens
6917575 as a migrant or as a refugee from the so called third world we can feel the heavy hand of racism in blacktown especially from the police and from those who still live in the era of the white australia policy
6917576 we have some very highly qualified people from overseas in blacktown working as security guards and cleaners meanwhile australia is importing people from britain or the us to work here as nurses or doctors we have to establish a way that these peoples qualifications will be recognised
6917577 there are very few jobs and the jobs that are available are very marginal ones instead of studying to get better qualifications people are forced to work in jobs which are not going to give blacktown a very bright future
6917578 the government is doing nothing to provide lower cost housing
6917579 the average price of a two bedroom flat is around 220 and this is really very high if somebody has only 300 each fortnight particularly for pensioners and single parents
6917580 they teach them how to act in australia but they dont teach them the language they will need to work with
6917581 there are many young families in blacktown and there are not enough places in public or community childcare this forces families to search of private childcare which is very expensive centrelink is helping but the lack of childcare places is still a major barrier for the families
6917582 we have to create places where they can enjoy themselves by learning and playing at the same time
6917583 over the last year many small businesses have been bankrupted because they cannot compete with the westpoint shopping centre
6917584 instead of concentrating all the shops in the one place westpoint and main street we need more shops in the suburbs such as doonside and rooty hill

6917588 the fairness creams are not effective and they just make tall claims
6917589 the herbal ingredients in the cream do not cause any drastic change in the skin colour some people use steroids to bring down the pigmentation but if it doesnt suit the skin the result is acne allergic reactions and skin irritation
6917590 if the chemical hydroquinone is used in any of the creams then it might get deposited in the skin leading to pigmentation
6917591 as the mayor it was my responsibility to provide facilities to the people
6917592 the kashmiris have given a fitting reply to the sangh parivar by uniting ranks and remaining peaceful throughout the current agitation

6917596 ponds is loves helping hand it doesnt make someone fall in love
6917597 i use the product its not a fairness cream but a cream that promises glowing pink skin
6917598 i am not a fairness cream person the cream i endorse does not only talk about fairness it deals with reducing dark spots also
6917599 fairness has no role to play in confidence my cream promotes a fresh and even toned skin
6917600 i personally feel my skin colour has helped me in the industry ultimately its not your skin colour that matters but your personality and talent
6917601 depicting better opportunities on account of fairness is sheer stupidity grown up and educated people should know better
6917602 i did try out those creams from personal experience i can say that none of these creams work
6917603 i like my skin colour but i do not find anything unethical with fairness creams the obsession with fairness is a very indian thing and the market is trying to tap on that which is perfectly ok

6917612 capitalism in india has evolved a long way since independence and is fairly well diversified today not just in terms of production profile but also social base capital is not a privileged bastion of a few mercantile castes the way it was its base has expanded to incorporate a wide spectrum of communities however this inclusive capitalism has been more a feature of southern and to some extent western india

6917626 we will study the drugs and the results should take another couple of days
6917627 some of our scores never showed this is boxing and cuba has too much clout too many judges in boxing are biased and sold out

6917629 were liberated to do what we do best because we know what is best for our campuses most of the time and you trust that that trust is critical for the proper functioning of any system
6917630 how much is it worth to the state of wisconsin to produce that one degree in terms of future tax revenues reduced impact on the healthcare system reduced impact on the prison system and all the other benefits that are disproportionately flowing to people who hold degrees beyond high school
6917631 how much is it worth to the state how much is it worth to the individual and who should pay which fraction thats the real question thats the debate we should be having
6917632 led their campuses with real integrity and intelligence the positive influence of their leadership will be felt for decades to come most directly on their own campuses but also in the way we operate as a system

6917634 i met him at a football game and we became inseparable
6917635 we were platoon leaders executive officers battalion staff officers and company commanders at the same time
6917636 being with another person in the military we both had a common understanding how things went and with not rushing into starting a family we were able to adjust to deployments a lot easier in the early years
6917637 we worked together as a team and it worked out very very well
6917638 i understand love in a different way than the way i did before
6917639 i understand loving my parents loving my spouse but the love for a child its unconditional its awesome it inspires you to go above and beyond anything you ever expected
6917640 we have a 14 month old boy and i have been deployed for nine months so i miss my son and havent had a lot of time to be with him
6917641 so far the army has been good at keeping us together
6917642 even with this deployment we were both in iraq within a few months of each other and will redeploy back to the states within a few months of each other
6917643 leaving my baby was the hardest thing i did for this deployment this has been one of our toughest years in the military one of the toughest years period
6917644 were looking at retirement homes were looking where we want to retire
6917645 no matter how big you think it is its bigger than that
6917646 we want them to know that even though theyre gone theyre still a member of the organization and will be when they get back
6917647 when youre deployed overseas you want to know there is a real world back home and you stay grounded in the insanity that youre doing by remembering that theres a reason behind it and its your family and your coworkers and your friends and everybody else
6917648 so its important we do the e mail it keeps them connected with that real world
6917649 theyre good experienced candidates that usually fit well into the training scheme
6917650 they come with a great set of work ethics that kind of sets an example for others to follow
6917651 its just kind of what we do and we didnt realize that not everybody did that
6917652 boston celtics sign sorta kinda semi retired forward darius miles
6917653 and then laughed and laughed while no one else laughed
6917654 i believe in individuality as well because it is spiritual
6917655 in an economy that everyone says is in a recession the freedom formula is teaching entrepreneurs how to create their own economy by combining
6917656 the intangible certainty of a refined almost aesthetic spiritual sensibility that married intercourse actually coarsened the spirit
6917657 er was niets in de speech van bernanke om de heersende verwachting dat de rentevoet voorlopig op het huidige niveau blijft aan te passen
6917658 forensically the scene was fairly clean not a whole lot of leads
6917659 just observation just looking at them they were almost identical
6917660 were definitely spent a lot of man hours in this case and hope to get it resolved here pretty soon
6917661 its a great feeling to be able to almost find a needle in a haystack on the internet
6917662 ive got the computer set up in there were watching the flights to make sure everythings going on time and on schedule
6917663 they were so busy over there he didnt get to call as much as he did the first time around
6917664 he went to iraq back in 2005 and that time not everyone came back so its probably the greatest thing this time that all of them are coming back
6917665 i know his biggest thing is to get some bbq some buffalo wild wings and a sub
6917666 for me to witness this is just incredible especially being 22 years old and being able to go out there and see it first hand its just amazing ive used the word surreal a couple of times

6917672 i feel like students want to go out on friday nights so i feel like the football games were a good thing and then saturday afternoons i dont know if theyll get that big of a crowd
6917673 saturday afternoons are a pretty good time for a high school football game it might conflict with some peoples tv viewing and going to college games but you know its better than having kids out late at night
6917674 i thought for sure it would pass and then someone on the metrolink campaign made the decision to advertise that the train would connect mid rivers mall with
6917675 that pretty much killed it right there soon you had people saying metrolink riders would come to st charles by train and leave by car stolen car
6917676 i know its not politically correct but how else do you explain it
6917677 madison police believe brittany zimmermann called 911 before she was stabbed and beaten to death inside her doty street apartment but the 911 center failed to send help after erroneously concluding the call was a mistake the 21 year old uw madison students body with multiple stab wounds to the chest and blunt force trauma to the head was discovered at 1 08 p m on april 2 by zimmermanns fianc the scene was such a mess that he initially believed zimmermann had been shot zimmermanns murder is the fifth unsolved madison homicide in the past 10 months two have occurred downtown inside homes during the day apparently by strangers four weeks after zimmermann was murdered her killer or killers remain at large and little is known about the investigation

6917680 to attain this degree of proficiency in a trick generally played with a tennis ball is something commendable
6917681 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6917682 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6917683 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws
6917684 were trying to say what is the best way to approach this issue
6917685 watching television can slow the development of children under three even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them

6917694 if it wasnt for the help of the russian army here there would be thousands and thousands more victims i am very grateful as an ossetian to my country great russia for this help
6917695 this is the last tragedy on the land of south ossetia i have already prepared an appeal to the president of russia and the government of russia to recognise the independence of the republic of south ossetia
6917696 this war was prepared not only in tbilisi but also in the united states and ukraine
6917697 we have never fought and will never fight against the people of georgia we offer them the hand of friendship and to all those who want to live in peace in the caucasus which is our common home i am convinced that we will all meet here again soon to celebrate the recognition of the independence of south ossetia the caucasus is a russian region and we will never surrender it to such adventurists as mikhail saakashvili the georgian president and condoleezza rice the us secretary of state

6917711 sen mccain worked with republicans and democrats alike to form immigration legislation and while the bill didnt pass only mccain demonstrated a real commitment to reforming immigration in a way that honored our laws as well as our immigrants and traditions
6917712 and barack obama obama did not stand up obama did not speak out and when the time came for him to do the right thing he did not

6917742 in any case the discussion of jewish law should be left to jews

6918023 our performance reflects the current economic climate of low interest rates and a very soft real estate market in the second quarter we made a prudent decision to increase our loan loss reserve even though our loan losses have been minimal this year because we expect little if any improvement in current economic conditions until 2009 however it is important to note that we are well capitalized and are appropriately positioned to operate in this uncertain environment

6918049 growing up i was very interested in science partially because of my older brother it formed a basis for having something in common my older brother would otherwise ignore me except for the fact that we could talk about science
6918050 by the time i was in middle school i started imagining the kinds of things i would do with my life
6918051 i got a bachelors degree in physics at mit then joined the peace corps in africa when i was a kid listening to kennedy you either wanted to be a peace corps volunteer or an astronaut and so peace corps was always something that had been a dream of mine
6918052 but i also realized once i got my bachelors degree that i didnt know the mechanisms of how graduate school worked things like how it was paid for or whether i needed to go straight into graduate school after my bachelors my family hadnt done phds we hadnt done graduate school so there was a little sense that i was going into uncharted territory
6918053 it has had its occasional difficulties and socially it had its difficulties discount the fact that having an easy social environment helps a lot
6918054 i had one professor who would start every lecture with well boys
6918055 im sure he was unconscious of it on his part but i was a little sensitive to it at the time he probably has no idea that he used to start his lectures that way
6918056 in practical terms it was a bit of a hindrance when i would go into my junior physics lab a classroom of 30 people nearly all of them men and everybody had to team up in pairs
6918057 i had one professor who would start every lecture with well boys
6918058 i think they were just intimidated to actually go up and talk to the one woman in the room but at the time i thought nobody wants me
6918059 the good news is if you want to impact that someone like me is living proof that this is a door that women are allowed to walk through
6918060 thinking back its not so surprising that this old peace corps volunteer has a component her that makes her think she should be giving back to the world
6918061 my students that i taught in africa had very little prospect of ever going to college very little prospect of ever having any material wealth in life
6918062 and so the real reason i do it isnt sociological or anything else its simply to share and to open a door
6918063 i have to admit i am privileged to be able to work on some of the greatest missions of our century
6918064 the first piece of advice i would give to anyone is find out what you love and do it then share that joy of what you love with the people around you
6918065 the second thing ive learned it that when the moment comes where youre absolutely desperate and youre pretty sure youre never going to be able to do what youve always wanted to right on schedule its
6918066 if you feel inadequate youre also right on schedule i struggle with that feeling every day but i prefer to deal with it after im done with work for the day
6918067 it helps if you just broaden your context its bigger than you its bigger than your institution and its bigger than your mission
6918068 if you feel inadequate youre also right on schedule i struggle with that feeling every day but i prefer to deal with it after im done with work for the day
6918069 day to day we get tired but at the end of the day you have to take a much longer view of how hard this day was or how hard this week was or even how hard this mission was think bigger than that
6918070 one of the things that jwst is designed to do is to look at the most distant objects you can see
6918071 if you want to see the earliest objects in the universe first of all you need to realize that theyre going to be faint because theyre so distant so you need to have a big telescope with a big mirror to collect the light the mirror on jwst is 21 feet in diameter
6918072 the second thing you need to realize is that the objects furthest away are moving
6918073 so if i wish to look at the very first galaxies i know that i need a big mirror and an observatory that can see infrared light so the science youre after drives the design once you know what science you want to do you can define the instrument that you need to do it
6918074 one of the most interesting areas of research that the jwst will help us to perform is to look at the origin of life using the light that is shining through a distant planets atmosphere we can actually start to diagnose the atmosphere of the planet but not only could we diagnose the atmosphere with the jwst we could also look for an atmosphere that is potentially carrying signatures of life
6918075 i want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
6918076 this is his decision and i expect him to make it however he feels is best
6918077 obviously doesnt have a very clear sense of what ordinary americans are going through
6918078 maybe mccain thinks this economy is working for folks like him but how are things going for you
6918079 i was not going to take the chance of letting that happen to me and my family
6918080 my wife called me about 3 30 4 oclock after she got out of school and tells me the preacher from calvary has texted her and told me what the text message said call me when you get a chance
6918081 as pastor of calvary baptist church there have been false accusations against me i will continue to give god the glory calvary is where christ makes the difference
6918082 the white mans mission is to farm the world and its a big enough job cut out for him what time has he got left to understand niggers anyways
6918083 knowing that were going to help 150 people today is fantastic
6918084 we decided we want to give something back to the community and we all feel that as you can see our cooking skills are excellent
6918085 theres a lot of retired people and things like that that cant cook their wives have passed away
6918086 we sit behind a desk all day a day outside is kind of fun
6918087 hopefully when they have their get together next weekend theyll look around and think weve made a difference
6918088 when people dont pull up for enough those detectors wont detect metal and theyll be sitting there for a prolonged period of time at a red light
6918089 i know it can be intimidating with highway 18 traffic back and forth

6918096 my expenses at the university of nebraska were about 3500 year for tuition fees and books
6918097 if there were no debt available for education then the education industry in order to remain viable would make itself affordable to a society which had no access to debt
6918098 debt should be viewed not just as financial leverage but also as leverage against time
6918099 research has shown college costs being highly correlated with available student loans
6918100 i walk to work i walk back from work im at home at 6 oclock in my pajamas watching television
6918101 its important to be aware of whats going on in your medium
6918102 it gives you an indication of what youre doing right and wrong or gives you something to shake your fist at in defiance
6918103 ive loved television since i was old enough to reach the dial
6918104 television is meaningful to me its frustrating and fascinating all at the same time
6918105 this is a turning point for muslims with regard to our participation in the political process
6918106 that really shook my faith in the leadership of this country not only the leadership in the white house but the leadership in the military
6918107 i wanted to be an example for other asian americans and other muslim americans involved in the process
6918108 i realized this was a great opportunity to show that muslims participate
6918109 we are an important and active part of the electorate in this country

6918116 zuma nesta rock sounds like a water park ride or a new energy drink zuma is unusual and rather appealing for a girl its said to be taken from zuma beach in malibu and while place names are great they have to fit the gender of the baby but with the a ending and the popular z beginning as in zoe zelda zora zuma just sounds too feminine so does nesta supposedly bob marleys real name and its not a good idea to pair two a endings as first and middle names too cutesy
6918117 rock is probably thrown in there just to point to the parents careers and it does help to add some masculinity
6918118 this celeb couple certainly succeeded in choosing an unusual name and they succeeded in making an even stronger statement about their fondness for jamaica kingston is named after jamaicas capital and nesta was jamaican singer bob marleys given first name
6918119 when it comes to historical naming tradition both zuma and nesta are most frequently considered girls names as this child grows up he will likely encounter some name induced gender identity issues
6918120 as for the subliminal effect the first name zuma will encourage a career in acting or music so this baby could find himself following in a parents footsteps with ease but he is also likely to flounder when it comes to communication and relationship compatibility because he carries a name that will establish a highly private nature
6918121 it seems the rossdales scarified quality for quirkiness and its a good bet little zuma may be investigating a name change at some point down the road
6918122 first of all zuma zuma is a diminutive of the aztec name montezuma not sure the rossdales realize that but its also associated with the zuma beach in los angeles which is really beautiful a lot of people are using place names now and i think they used it after the beach most likely
6918123 i would recommend that the boy grow up using the name rock rossdale because thats probably the only normal name in there hes gonna grow up in the creative community so i dont think hell get picked on too much but theres only one percent of people surveyed on babynames com that said they loved it and 50 percent said they hated it thats a lot
6918124 kingston seems so upper class and just sophisticated that everybody was expecting another name that went along with it

6918130 there has been considerable interest in developing the natural gas resources contained in the marcellus shale interests that could yield a substantial economic boom for the commonwealth
6918131 dep has been working in cooperation with the susquehanna and delaware river basin commissions to create a consistent streamlined process for evaluating water usage and disposal in all areas of the state because this type of drilling requires significant amounts of water
6918132 this addendum to the permit application requiring a water management plan will reduce administrative delays for the drilling industry while helping us to determine what demands will be placed on our natural water resources
6918133 there is the potential for significant economic opportunity for the citizens of the commonwealth with the development of the marcellus shale formation but this resource must be extracted in a manner that is consistent with state and federal laws that protect our water resources
6918134 the drilling industry has been cooperative with this effort and dep regional staff has been trained on the new procedures so that permit applications can be reviewed and processed in a timely manner

6918144 i know there are thousands of people around the country who are making a difference in tackling drug use and i want to hear from the individuals and teams who are going the extra mile to help change lives
6918145 drug use is at its lowest level for 13 years and i know those at the frontline have played a vital role in reducing the harm caused by drugs and making their communities safer
6918146 the government is committed to tackling drugs through tough enforcement education information campaigns and where appropriate treatment so that communities can be free of drug related crime and drug users can lead positive lives free of illegal substances
6918147 i encourage anyone who knows an individual or team who has really made a difference to nominate them for an award
6918148 behind the scenes there are many people working day in day out to tackle drugs change lives and protect families and communities by reducing drug related crime
6918149 if you know an individual or team in the region who deserves to be recognised please nominate them for an award as they could be in with a chance of winning a prize for their local drugs initiative or project

6918249 i love horror films not just because i crave the goose bump factor of a good evisceration but also because horror is one of the most metaphorically rich genres of the postmodern age
6918250 horror is an allegory for existence teeth takes a bite out of sexism in society the last winter fast forwards to the rising tide of global warming even the granddaddy of modern monster movies jaws indicts the pettiness of business interests determined to keep the beaches open no matter whats in the water horror intimately reflects who we are what we want and what scares the capri pants off us from hamlet to hostel horror is as fundamental to human existence as comedy and tragedy its like beckett only with disemboweling whats not to love

6918254 all of the good feelings that i had last year at westchester basically they are there but as far as it relates to the course they are gone because were at a different venue
6918255 youve just got to go around and learn this one all over again and try to gain some good positive feelings from what youve got here
6918256 i think as we get further along into this tournament the scoring could get a little bit better
6918257 just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6918258 i feel like it puts extra pressure on you each week you have this extra goal out there that you are trying to make and its hard to focus on both things
6918259 so its been difficult to try to shove that in the back of my mind because it keeps coming up it keeps presenting itself to me that i very much want to be on that team so ive always got to try to put it back and concentrate on whats at hand
6918260 because they belong to that country near jerusalem which is a great way off so do camels but i think you have seen a camel at all events they are brought over here sometimes and if you would like to see one i will show you one
6918261 god makes no difference between those who wear good clothes and those who go barefoot and in rags never be proud or unkind my dears to any poor man woman or child
6918262 there is a child born to day in the city of bethlehem near here who will grow up to be so good that god will love him as his own son emphasis mine and he will teach men to love one another and not to quarrel and hurt one another and his name will be jesus christ and people will put that name in their prayers because they will know god loves it and will know that they should love it too
6918263 a child who will live to be a man whom all people will love

6918292 however my active involvement with the guild didnt begin until my son was hospitalized in 2003 at three years old he caught influenza and had to be placed in isolation for an extended period the amazing care he received spurred my need to become part of the organization
6918293 the guild is a significant provider of funds for st john
6918294 the hospital petitions us whenever they have a need the guild then works to fulfill their request recently for example the guild purchased a machine to supplement the hospitals groundbreaking work in cardiac research and a software system for patient tracking through the emergency department

6918316 we just followed the songs lyrical lead and built them up with textures and sounds that served the story the beautiful ones were darker and worked with lush arrangements we used the sounds of rain tree branches falling on the roof whatever kept the mood true to this haunted studio in the first stormy days of spring the second part became more anthemic like a reclaiming of personal power theres something raw about it to me it sounds weathered but not broken or cynical
6918317 its about being willing to take a risk even if its not going to end up well teeth is like rediscovering your backbone after youve gone through the loss
6918318 were getting additional support sen lamar alexander is helping us in the senate the fact of the matter is this session may very well get away from us without getting it done but weve laid the good foundation so we can hit the ground running in the next session again it makes no sense to me that when we have a limited amount of space in this country to store radioactive waste that we would become the only nation in the world thats going to take it from other countries which would take space away from this country
6918319 the nrc will likely approve the license because they have a narrow criterion
6918320 however the compact there in utah does not want to accept it and now energysolutions is actually suing the compact saying you have to take it we need to have a national policy and get out of the court i dont want to be the only country in the world that accepts it from elsewhere

6918323 probably the most significant factor in this reevaluation has been the success of the surge in iraq
6918324 almost all the experts said it wouldnt work and it did work and the evidence is everywhere when a president is right and all of his critics are wrong sooner or later voters who are not hard partisans recognize that and give the president credit
6918325 the foreign policies in place now are more sensible moderate and mainstream
6918326 in many cases the next president should follow rather than reverse them
6918327 i think were getting hints of the image rehabilitation that will inevitably come but it wont come until some time in the next presidency or two
6918328 it generally takes time for peoples partisan feelings to abate and for people to look back and take a fresh view of an old presidency
6918329 if you are reading this then you are already dead

6918333 im very confident j t is at the point where hes our best man for the job right now
6918334 this hasnt been a case of alex and shaun not performing well
6918335 this has been a case of j t performing very well thats why we are where we are j t has very good command of the offense hes played well in all three preseason games and now its time for us to get ready for the regular season
6918336 we want to play our best players that give us the best chance to win
6918337 for our football teams sake its time to get ready for our opening game this decision puts more focus on where it should be now
6918338 ty tribble is one of the few networkers out there whos really on top of the internet marketing world

6918341 bo short develops great leaders he has a talent for coaching people to attain significance in their personal and professional lives
6918342 bo touched our people in a way no other speaker has done his lessons on leadership are inspiring
6918343 as a true solutions provider ty is someone who genuinely cares about the best interest of his prospects and business partners he wants to help others get to the next level in their business regardless of what business they are in network marketing or not
6918344 very seldom does someone come along with the expertise to make an organization better bo has done just that his leadership and ability to communicate have lifted our executive team to greater heights
6918345 we lost all of our track position and seemed to lose focus
6918346 it was just one of those long nights where we were great to start and then went down the drain pretty quick that was disappointing
6918347 i feel like every race im getting ready to be cut loose almost
6918348 i never have that false sense of job security i think a lot of guys get in trouble feeling like you can be here forever and i feel like going into this weekend if i dont perform right if i dont get the job done if i make mental mistakes im going to be on that border line
6918349 last year we would struggle for a while but then wed bounce right back and have some top 15s we knew it was around the corner we just had to make good decisions and not make mistakes but i still have that same feel i feel like that im not irreplaceable that i can mess up for a few weeks in a row and ill be on the hot seat
6918350 davids done it the way that i think it should be done
6918351 he came in going to prove to the world that he had to figure out how all this worked and he backed it down and he became much more concerned about running well but also understanding they were 500 mile races
6918352 he deserves a tremendous amount of respect and accolades because hes made huge improvements and hes done it in a quiet way you can have several approaches in how you do this but one thing you have to understand is you make the rules for everybody else so the way you drive is the way everybody else drives you his first few races i dont think he got that but he did learn it really quickly
6918353 i tried to be aggressive my first few starts in this series and i didnt have the experience to back it up and i looked like a fool
6918354 now ive got the experience to back it up ive obviously got better car control and a better feel for what i need in the race car to go fast and probably have a little bit more respect from the competitors out on the racetrack and everything is just a little easier
6918355 when you have all those things you can afford to be more aggressive
6918356 its like having a 3 year old and being mad because that 3 year old acts like a 3 year old
6918357 you cant have a young driver and then give up on them because he acts like a young driver once you make that commitment youve got to be willing to see it through and help him mature and it looks like all parties did that with ragan
6918358 weve got as good a shot at getting in as any of the guys in the top 14
6918359 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6918360 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6918361 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6918362 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6918363 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
6918364 its a lot more fun when youre not hitting out of the trees and chipping out sideways
6918365 i need to go out saturday and have a good day and shoot 6 or 7 under

6918371 well you have to give the director a scenario in which they can pull it off
6918372 you have to create a situation in which the actors and director if youre not going to hear what theyre thinking you have to see it choreograph it on the page i would definitely not be doing my job if i left that up to the cast and the director to figure out

6918428 we were shocked at the extent of abuses of employment rights
6918429 it is unacceptable that these practices exist today and equally unfair that when they do services to help vulnerable workers are left over stretched and under funded
6918430 sustainable funding is also needed for independent employment rights advice so that when workers experience problems they can access support and government trade unions and employers need to work together to make sure this happens
6918431 for me i just had probably the best game of my career we got in late and i was kind of tired today but a lot of guys say when youre tired you have your best days

6918728 that bloke from oasis said i couldnt play guitar someone shoulda told him im a mutha bleeping rock star today is gonna be the day that im gonna throw it back to you im living life as a rocker
6918729 you cant say its the economy because there are shows like mamma mia that are selling out
6918730 its not that katies bad in the part shes good enough the producers are just getting the feeling people still want to view katie as her character sweet little joey potter
6918731 we get a laugh out of it shes really cool she just takes everything as it comes
6918732 she doesnt read about herself but i think people tell her and she gets a kick out of it shes very calm and very secure she knows people are always going to talk that stuff doesnt bother her
6918733 if you like airplanes you get to see a lot of neat things were always looking to add to our membership in getting kids and younger folks involved so its a really good hobby the people here its good companionship and its just good friends
6918734 todays destination is lake metigoshe state park its one of north dakotas hottest weekend attractions and although the summer may be coming to an end activities go year round here at the park
6918735 most of the people that come here are either going to be on the lake doing recreation whether its jet skiing skiing fishing or a great number of them bring their bikes with and theyre hiking and biking on the trail system just enjoying themselves and a lot of those activities are connected right with the learning center that weve got so the combination of that gives a family a great opportunity to come out and spend time together
6918736 there are also miles of scenic trails winding around the park that allow you to see the wide variety of plant an wildlife offered here at metigoshe
6918737 were a complete year round operation we have the typical activities as far as the campground and the boat ramp and picnic areas and those things but once fall starts a lot of great bird watching opportunities go right into winter then it becomes the skiing snow shoeing were right on the state snowmobile trail its a complete year round activity
6918738 its very very inexpensive for a family or an individual to come out and enjoy themselves
6918739 its very important to us because when you have people that were as supportive of minot state university as doug was its a chance for all of us to give back in his name and weve got recipients of that scholarship now that i know doug would be very proud of that they are receiving a scholarship in his name for their actions not only in competition but in the classroom
6918740 creo que nos est faltando m s tranquilidad sabemos de la problem tica del equipo y aparte que se nos complican los partidos en casa entonces hay que tener m s tranquilidad y decisi n de tres cuartos de cancha hac a adelante para liquidar los juegos nos falta m s contundencia
6918741 ellos se encontraron con el gol porque para m el penalti lo regal el rbitro porque son jugadas normales dentro del rea adem s el defensa me jal primero y yo met las manos para equilibrarme pero son decisiones del silbante
6918742 creo que sac dos o tres pelotas importantes pero para eso est un arquero creo que hizo un gran partido y ellos se llevan un resultado importante de aqu nosotros tenemos que seguir trabajando en la tranquilidad y la contundencia hac a delante
6918743 es un rival fuerte din mico y sin duda ser un juego muy complicado en el que nosotros tenemos que salir a como d lugar por los tres puntos estamos en casa y tenemos que hacerla respetar
6918744 es una ofensiva muy r pida con grandes jugadores este a o llegaron extranjeros importantes pero nosotros tenemos que estar muy pendientes de que no nos hagan goles tempraneros
6918745 eso ya nos ha pasado en los ltimos partidos y todo resulta muy complicado as que tenemos que poner mucha atenci n en no permitir goles en los primeros minutos
6918746 nunca hay equipo f cil todos se arman con la intenci n de ser competidores importantes en el torneo y si bien atlas atraviesa por una mala racha eso no significa que no sean un equipo peligroso
6918747 no se ha dado pero estoy trabajando en eso y con la convicci n de que en cuanto caiga el primero vendr n los dem s en racimo as pasa con las rachas y lo que hacemos es no desesperarnos
6918748 no nos importa no perder sino seguir sumando que para nosotros es importante y m s cuando estamos en casa

6918750 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
6918751 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader
6918752 to date the cftc has found that supply and demand fundamentals offer the best explanation for the systematic rise in oil prices
6918753 regardless of their classification the cftcs market surveillance group scrutinizes daily the positions of all large traders both commercial and non commercial to guard against market manipulation
6918754 when the cftc granted the 1991 hedging exemption to j aron a division of goldman sachs it signaled a major shift that has since allowed investors to accumulate enormous positions for purely speculative purposes
6918755 legitimate businesses that hedge and take physical delivery of oil are being trampled by the speculators who are in the market purely to make profit

6918813 ella estaba lista para pelear en todos los puntos y empec a sentirme un poco cansada
6918814 despu s de eso fue empeorando y finalmente para terminar el encuentro en los ltimos dos games yo ya estaba fuera de combate
6918815 me sent bien en el segundo tiempo me queda duda de la jugada del gol registrado a los 35 minutos fue una distracci n nuestra la culpa es m a pero en el segundo tiempo siento que hice bien las cosas y nos llevamos un punto importante

6918819 este es un nuevo reto una nueva ilusi n que tenemos con un equipo lleno de ganas de hacer las cosas bien en espa a y de retener el t tulo que es lo que todos deseamos

6918821 ellos han trabajado y el cuerpo t cnico ha planificado las cosas bien igual para ser campeones y para entregarse en la pista aunque el deporte es muy incierto la disposici n es igual

6918845 its tough probably the lowest point for me that ive had to deal with i think ive kind of bottomed out but that doesnt mean i dont believe that i can come back and be a legit starter for this club
6918846 throughout my career and especially when it comes to situational pitching ive always felt like when ive had my legit slider which is my out pitch ive felt like i could get out of anything and this year for whatever reason its just been inconsistent off and on you can just see that in times when ive gone up against a good left handed bat its been a very very effective pitch its been a plus pitch and its not a plus pitch right now its inconsistent when it flattens out its very hittable and its cost me in bad situations in a ballgame
6918847 skips got a job to do and hes got to make the decision for this club and right now you cant feel good about me going out there after what happened in texas i mean i dont feel good about me going out there after what happened in texas i know i have better stuff than that if i dont have anything to throw off of that fastball then im in trouble

6919057 in most cases there are no snags because we wouldve caught it when they came back from another show or flight
6919058 if everythings good we store the aircraft and go home
6919059 or often when were on the road we go to sign autographs or attend functions dealing with the public is a lot of fun

6919083 lo m s dif cil en el mundo es reducir el gasto corriente por eso cuando se quiere reducir o moderar el gasto p blico por lo general las que terminan pagando el pato son las inversiones
6919084 el nfasis est en el gasto corriente y pido a todos reflexionar sobre cu nto pueden ahorrar en celulares papel combustible etc pero pido tambi n una reflexi n sobre la calidad de las inversiones planeadas
6919085 sabemos que no es un consuelo que los precios suban en todo el mundo por eso no nos cruzamos de brazos
6919086 pero todos tenemos que hacer un esfuerzo combinado el poder ejecutivo el poder legislativo y la poblaci n
6919087 es all donde el congreso tiene una responsabilidad yo solo puedo invocar a los gobiernos regionales a modular su gasto pero los congresistas tienen m s capacidad de persuadir a las autoridades de sus regiones y a la poblaci n para que compartan las responsabilidad de luchar contra el proceso inflacionario

6919113 those guys are perverts the type who climb telephone poles and peep through windows at trailer parks
6919114 it is becoming increasingly clear that seiu leaders often see students and campus workers as little more than pawns to use as they see fit
6919115 seiu has sought to maneuver these pawns in a way that brings new members and dues into the union in the short term but keeps workers in poverty and actually hurts our collective efforts to help unions grow at a massive scale
6919116 the deal ensured unc workers could not join seiu by letting aramark decide which workers could join the union
6919117 the information in the letter from the student organizations to andy stern is simply not true
6919118 we would never even attempt to respond to such a document which seems to be part of an anti stern campaign
6919119 but i want to make the point that its just an extension of what unions have been forced to do
6919120 when summer break came the swu organizers left promising to return the following year
6919121 after weeks of unreturned phone calls students and workers learned that seiu leaders had cut a deal with aramark
6919122 our employees have the right to choose whether or not to join a union in a process that is free from coercion or intimidation
6919123 the students are motivated by this kind of ideological emotional and political vision of unionism and correctly so and i think seiu is in danger of pushing that aside
6919124 they should have insisted we insist on north carolina or berkeley one of the hotspots
6919125 we respect the right of each of our affiliates to act autonomously
6919126 however we as a national organization are committed to remaining neutral in seius internal conflicts and those of all our union allies
6919127 we already had our campaign going on and then this other union comes in that was shady
6919128 this blatant effort by aramark to undermine the workers sic efforts is not surprising but seius complicity is appalling
6919129 i dont want to see the union behave in a way that engenders distrust
6919130 i think it actually could result in long term harm in the labor movement
6919131 i think there probably are clearly times where the union has kind of used students as leverage
6919132 i dont want to say as pawns but certainly as leverage in order to win these agreements or win these campaigns and i think that creates a lot of resentment on the part of students
6919133 especially in this economy the way it is this needs to happen much more
6919134 we save and save and we come here and spend
6919135 its expensive now days you can only go so many places without running out of gas and baby stuffs extremely expensive
6919136 farm sanctuary changing hearts amp minds about animals amp food
6919137 what has concerned us is the violence the disruptions that has led us to be concerned about the safety of our employees our equipment and investment and of the viability of the process
6919138 we need to protect our people how would we be able to bring our managers and their families if they are going to get beaten if anybody is under the impression that because we have made a large investment of 15bn rupees 184m we would not move then they are wrong because we would move to protect our people
6919139 tata say they have no plan b the factory is nearly complete and the money is spent in west bengal if they start again somewhere else it will take time and there will be a cost implication however nano will be loss making at this price so tata may save some money in that way
6919140 its disastrous the real problem is the way that land was acquired by government strong arming people into selling their land
6919141 i think the real question here is whether indians want to remain starving peasants or part of an urban proletariat my bet is the latter
6919142 i think we are seeing local people having a say in the process and sometimes projects are pulled just recently 11 dams were cancelled after local protests in sikkim
6919143 industrialisation has been violent in other countries but i think indian democracy can accommodate it without the violence
6919144 whats in it for me i heard you the first time
6919145 youve got a nerve to be asking a favor weve been through this before

6919150 the only thing worse than sitting in that senate room and having only one vote is to be forced to sit in that senate sit and have no vote
6919151 oh crap bruce ennis is going to be nothing but a younger more healthy jim vaughn who needs that
6919152 i know its too late but its still a good idea and certainly worth considering for the future
6919153 i didnt have a choice about whether i was going to do this or not because i think about this all the time
6919154 you got to be honest with what you do every day youre going to wake up and youre going to look in the mirror when you shave and you have to deal with that person youre looking at
6919155 thats ridiculous what do you think youre going to do why would anybody want that
6919156 well maybe its time to go open up a coffee shop or something
6919157 i stood up in front of 300 audience members and gave her a keepsake
6919158 we were already self sustaining at that point but having oprahs approval helped a lot
6919159 this is a family business that started as a hobby with our daughters we want to maintain that integrity
6919160 i have to have one for tom cruise and katie holmes
6919161 i could see there was a real lack of high end services in hawaii
6919162 it was like heres the challenge they already think i dont have what it takes so ive only got one hour to win them over
6919163 i went around to about 100 independent pet stores in northern california and 100 in southern california
6919164 i got about 35 000 in revenue in our first month
6919165 that was a big key to me managing my own destiny
6919166 i quickly realized that there were no fashion based products for pets
6919167 we got our chops wet in servicing the boutique market
6919168 i had a great foundation in terms of creating and launching products
6919169 with pet fashions nobody had really implemented a multiproduct fashion based offering in the mass market and thats what we did
6919170 being able to motivate them and relate to them since i wasnt that much older i saw there was a niche for that type of mentoring and tutoring
6919171 we are dealing with the futures and the lives of the students its not just a matter of being able to sell the program
6919172 its important to be able to provide that follow up service and really deliver on our promises
6919173 we were growing so fast at the time and i wasnt paying attention to my dashboard or thinking macroeconomically
6919174 this is a global business that were growing and there are global opportunities
6919175 energy conservation is one of the very few things that you can do in every part of this world
6919176 having to live that every single day and constantly struggle with it really teaches you a lot about budgets and growing companies
6919177 we had a dorm room that looked like an office
6919178 i can proudly say that after that initial investment weve been profitable ever since
6919179 when we starting doing collaboration and community software seven years ago it wasnt the cool thing to do
6919180 that was before web 2 0 the market evolved at the same time we were evolving our products
6919181 we loved being a bootstrapped company but we always knew at some point it would be time to hit the gas
6919182 i figured out that i didnt want to be on the front line i wanted to be on the back line
6919183 i have to thank my mother for being able to deal with different attitudes and the timing issues and for making sure i got to school
6919184 our culture isnt just about living in the projects theres so much more
6919185 the way that im looking at the music business now is that its an overall business of entertainment
6919186 one of the things that makes karmaloop unique is that were much more than an e commerce site
6919187 we had to learn on a very tight budget and be very careful about every penny we spent
6919188 weve framed it as a movement to help save people from the evil forces of mcfashion
6919189 clothing and music and culture are completely linked its all symbiotic
6919190 its those lessons that make us who we are today
6919191 our competitors focus on price and availability but we discovered a market that craves service
6919192 did 27 million last year with 112 salespeople we did 16 million with 14
6919193 whose model is better we need to focus on the human aspect of employees and customers
6919194 i would have tried harder taken bigger risks and made even more mistakes
6919195 formal education will make you a living self education will make you a fortune
6919196 i have arrived i am wonder boy im a multimillionaire
6919197 pretty darn awesome there is certainly talk about a sequel i have no doubt that it will happen im sure that it will be a trilogy

6919203 there just seem to be too many excuses for not being assertive enough to move these things from recommendations to requirements
6919204 many of these things go back to aircraft piloting 101

6919344 i also have heard senator obama refer continually to afghanistan and he references being on the foreign relations committee

6919359 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6919360 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond

6919597 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6919598 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective

6919600 technically by aug 19 the judges should have been reinstated
6919601 should be debated on monday and tuesday and on wednesday this resolution should be passed and the judges should be reinstated

6919608 it is my duty to thank mr president he has performed a great act of maturity
6919609 changing constitutions will be possible only with a new parliament we need to be realistic the existing parliament is not likely to agree on any change of the existing constitution thus turkey needs to head for elections to write a new constitution
6919610 the greatest obstacle before a new constitution is the tough stance of the main opposition republican peoples party chp and the opposition nationalist movement party mhp statements by chp officials note that although the party itself is displeased with the existing constitution it does not need reform to make up for its deficiencies chp deputy group chairman kemal anadol in one of his speeches suggested that his party would not cooperate in changing constitutions
6919611 this decision by the constitutional court has shown that the court will feel itself free to revise all constitutional changes in essence though it is not authorized to do so cooperation with the chp to replace the constitution seems impossible it is however necessary to replace it because a constitution prepared under the shadow of a military coup cannot meet the needs of turkey on the path to democratization and modernization i believe if supported by a required number of voters no power will be able to hinder efforts to replace the constitution
6919612 such an initiative by toptan would be a well intentioned effort but i dont believe he will be able to ensure cooperation among all political parties for a change in constitution unless all political parties agree on the idea of replacing the constitution it will not prove beneficial for turkish democracy

6919710 we are you know the finish last week didnt show it but we ran as good as we have at a two mile track all year and the short tracks we feel comfortable coming back to these places and weve got an idea of what we want to do when we come here we just need to start rolling off some of these top 15 and top 10 finishes and see what we can get out of the rest of this year
6919711 the first time i came here you walk in and its overwhelming the place is awesome its so many people 170 000 people packed around a half mile track its just cool to come here
6919712 we thought that we could be a little bit better than what we ran in practice but were just a little bit too free getting in on the first lap and we made some small adjustments i just feel that were a little too free with the mobil 1 dodge but the big thing is that we keep our heads up and keep working at it the car hopefully will be pretty good in race trim i think that we found out some things that are going to help us out a lot from the time when we switched over to qualifying today that were going to be able to take with us to a racetrack looking forward to getting that final practice in and see where were at it was a little scary a little too free getting into one and into three on that first lap i was hoping that we didnt get ourselves into another problem weve had a frustrating day for sure
6919713 i dont know what happened our valvoline dodge was strong in practice and i was happy with the setup the crew did a great job this morning getting it prepared i was just really loose getting into one and two the car slipped up the track and i had to catch it i guess the track just got really slick sitting in the sun all morning right now were not happy the valvoline team is better than this and weve made every race weve attempted to qualify for this year so this isnt going to sit well but ill tell you one thing it really motivates us for next week

6919732 same car it seems to run good this car was new at milwaukee and its ran good every time weve run it hopefully we can keep up the good work and race hard all night and be there at the end when it counts
6919733 greg fornelli president and ceo of stock car steel and aluminum and sri supplies for racing amp industry always jokes that his favorite words in nascar are when we yell theres trouble in turn two

6919735 our business is all about providing new sheet metal and supplies for race cars so at least this is good for our business
6919736 by joining dsr we hope to brand nhra and other racing venues as well

6919738 what we were looking for initially was consistency with fuel especially oxygenated fuels
6919739 with the way that fuels are typically oxygenated they lose their oxygenation content and other different factors as soon as the seal on the can is broken which causes inconsistencies with performance
6919740 the really great thing about it is that we burn all of the fuel so there are no residuals therefore the emissions are clean its essentially a horsepower producing green racing fuel
6919741 we are proud to welcome xxx racing fuels to don schumacher racing
6919742 we will work closely with them to help raise the awareness of their remarkable product within the
6919743 since last year this time weve made a ton of progress
6919744 it really is like being on a knifes edge even when your setups are close you can still get off really easy were definitely still working on that and trying to make that not so much of a knifes edge when you lose it on a long run and have to wait last week i was just waiting for the next pit stop waiting for 50 laps to try and get our setup back thats just how it is right now but yeah the car has come a long ways the set ups the things were doing to get the car to go around the corner is definitely much better
6919745 i dont know for sure but when you look at jeff gordon and look at how much hes won in the past to me if he didnt win last year or this year you just look back and see how much he won four years ago or three or seven years ago the guy has been so good in this sport that if hes not winning whats wrong why isnt jeff gordon winning why is that i dont know hell get there to winning obviously hell figure it out and win plenty more before hes done
6919746 more than likely youd want the track position the tire is different for this race until we get some practice in today it will be tough to tell what well be doing during pit stops but i know at times you can put on tires if there are 40 laps to go and definitely pass a lot of cars and other times you just stay in your spot it will be something that well have to figure out as the weekend goes
6919747 i dont know ive played a lot of basketball a lot of baseball so i understand what they other athletes do to a certain point because of coaches they run you and things so as far as being in that kind of shape no were not i dont think that you have to be like that i try to stay in good shape carl edwards is in great shape jeff burton theres a lot of people that are in great shape that could go out and play basketball on a pick up team for sure and have fun as far as do you have to i dont think you have to be in that kind of shape to race in the sport i think what you have to have is the focus for four hours without ever losing that focus theres definitely a lot there that you have when you play sports in terms of focus and want and drive but in terms of do i have to run five miles straight to race i dont think so
6919748 i think our consistency has been there i havent looked at results in a long time but i feel like weve been from about seventh to 15th since weve won those races all star and coca cola 600 maybe not every one but there are a lot that have been right in that area so consistency weve had last week we had an engine problem thats a part of racing thats how it goes theres nothing that you can do about that i think that our consistency has been good we havent been consistent on winning running in the top three but who has other than the 18 kyle busch i dont think anybody has carl edwards is getting up to that point jimmie johnson is getting much better from seventh to 15th i think that weve been very consistent our team has done a great job it takes time last year at this time we were 28th in points and didnt have a shot at anything i think weve come a long ways as team and our consistency from seventh or eighth to 15th has been really good as far as im concerned

6919762 voters who are strongly opposed to abortion are much more likely than other voters to say that these are very important voting issues
6919763 not good enough for the pole but we went out in qualifying so early third that the track was real slick my stanley tools dodge crew did a great job preparing the car weve got 500 laps to run here on saturday night well just have to pass more guys than wed like qualifying isnt as important as it once was here as you have two grooves to pass i think we have a fast car here at bristol well just work on it some more and go racing saturday night
6919764 ill take it im happy that we improved our alltel dodge from where we were at in practice earlier today well start 11th its not a great thing but considering we were down in the speed charts during practice 28th well take it
6919765 we just couldnt get our budweiser dodge to turn good on that qualifying run its hard to go fast when you cant turn the track didnt seem a whole lot different from practice to me it seemed really similar we just have to keep working on our car to get it better for tomorrow night we had a great car in practice no 1 overall but were just a little tight on the qualifying run we just have to fix it
6919766 we were just slipping and sliding around no matter how hot or cold the track was today i just couldnt get our miller lite dodge to turn at all
6919767 it was good to get back into the car this weekend may seems like a long time ago we werent very good in practice but stewart cooper crew chief did a nice job with the adjustments this team is fun to be around man theyre just racers i didnt realize how much i missed them we have one more practice session tonight so we need to continue to work hard and get this no 45 wells fargo dodge dialed in
6919768 were just happy to be here this weekend with tums on the car were trying to figure out how to get it better when we got here the car was tight now its loose in and tight off we have to do our homework this next hour before practice and figure out how to get our car better
6919769 we were just too loose the track changed got slicker and we just didnt make the right adjustments on our barrett jackson auction dodge we just made a mistake and thats going to hurt us tomorrow night
6919770 we thought that we could be a little bit better than what we ran in practice but were just a little bit too free getting in on the first lap and we made some small adjustments
6919771 the car hopefully will be pretty good in race trim i think that we found out some things that are going to help us out a lot from the time when we switched over to qualifying today that were going to be able to take with us to a racetrack im looking forward to getting that final practice in and see where were at it was a little scary a little too free getting into turn 1 and into turn 3 on that first lap i was hoping that we didnt get ourselves into another problem weve had a frustrating day for sure
6919772 we just havent hit on a set up were not hooked up with the track right now we dont have an answer well make changes and try to get a something that will work during this final practice session we have some work to do
6919773 we were just way too loose i couldnt get the car to turn and lost too much momentum to try to get a fast lap
6919774 right now were not happy the valvoline team is better than this and weve made every race weve attempted to qualify for this year so this isnt going to sit well but ill tell you one thing it really motivates us for next week
6919775 with just four drivers in contention to win the indycar series championship the pressure is on and in order to help fans and viewers at home easily identify those four contenders firestone racing will debut a new tire look for the eligible cars while these tires will be the exact same specification used by all indycar series drivers they will make the top four really stand out in the crowd based on our experience with this particular spec earlier this year in mid ohio we are confident that our softer road course tire compound construction will help drivers navigate the twisting infineon track and all of its elevation changes so as the championship battle reaches its concluding stages drivers will have the confidence in their tires needed to focu s on the task at hand
6919776 it was a nice lap i think this year ive been pretty good at the end of the session its nice to be back at a road course after having some trouble at kentucky its a new track for me so im learning every time i go out there and ive been working well with the team im surprised because even though we were fighting for the pole the whole session we had a fuel pump problem on the last two laps i couldnt believe that i would make it but i pushed any way when they said i got pole i couldnt believe it i guess its good but now im disappointed because we could have been so much quicker
6919777 we expected to be on the pole but it was a tough session it was difficult to time traffic so i got traffic on both of my new tire runs so it was quite difficult but at least the guy im battling in the championship is right behind me so thats a good thing well see i think we have a consistent car for tomorrow so we need to make sure we make the right adjustments for the race tomorrow
6919778 qualifying for us was ok the gearbox let us down in the last two laps i think the shift cable broke maybe i pushed too hard on the cable but were pushing because its qualifying im hoping to put up a solid finish tomorrow with the lucas oil lifelock car and gain the maximum amount of points possible
6919779 being sportsmen in our country weve met a couple of times whenever they do awards back home im a big fan of all sports and for sure i support sportsmen from my country
6919780 there is a lot of competition in any sport especially when you come overseas people dont really recognize you you have to learn the language and you have to learn a lot of the different things that we dont deal with in our country you have to work really hard to stay on it and be humble about it this is my 20th season in the big leagues so im really proud that i still have the chance to go out there and compete at a very high level
6919781 its the first time to watch the indycars in person
6919782 thats what wed like to do but you can see the competition is going to make it tough helio is very strong and so is tk tony kanaan and my teammate dan wheldon as well weve had a pretty good streak recently if we can keep it up and gain points on helio castroneves then thats the way wed like to do it
6919783 weve had a bit of rough year on road courses compared to the past especially at st pete and watkins but at edmonton we showed that the team is very strong we have the speed but it seems we struggle a bit more in qualifying we just cant seem to get the speed the others have for one or two laps the race were fairly confident
6919784 its a slight change i think it will help it opens up a passing opportunity but its tough because you have cars that are fairly equal so its hard to pass its very easy to overshoot so if youre close enough to someone in the race you could pressure them into a mistake it will be a lot easier to make a pass than what it was
6919785 were trying to put it all behind us every time we go back to the truck its hard to forget because were missing a lot of our tools that we would be able to use here the good news is that team penske is always prepared we had a truck that came from charlotte n c and brought a bunch of stuff that well be able to use as replacements this weekend but things like the seat that i really liked it unfortunately burned but you cant complain the car is actually in great shape and ready to go they are trying to make it look like nothing happened and to be honest if you didnt know about the fire it would probably still be like that this is the team that ca n rebound they know how to do it it happened once and hopefully this will be the last time
6919786 i told them that my setup was on fire all joking aside the good news is that nobody was hurt and things can be replaced whats amazing is the attitude of the team theyve been working a lot and theyre going to be working a lot up until the race theyre not complaining nobody is having any trouble so for me this just shows how incredible those guys are and to have the opportunity to work with people like that is just incredible
6919787 absolutely otherwise i wouldnt be here there are still a lot of points in the game we know what we need to do i think they have more to lose than us were going to continue trying like we have been doing the last two races were going to be fighting even if there amp rs quo s just one point and even if it looks impossible we amp rs quo re g oing to have the faith we can get it
6919788 the good news is that i am very comfortable with the road courses the bad news is that he is also very comfortable with the road courses its going to be neck in neck in his situation he doesnt have to do much i think just following can be the best thing that he can do because if he makes a mistake it would cost more than he would gain im not counting on him making a mistake and im not wishing him a mistake what i can do is just focus on the work ahead of us and thats what were going to do
6919789 realistically i dont think i can win the championship i just want to focus on having a real strong finish to the season and do well in these last few races and australia obviously i dont think scott dixon really needs too much help at this point but ill certainly be the teammate that he needs me to be in any given situation
6919790 i guess weve been in the top five an awful lot and weve won a couple of races is it the season i would have liked no is it the season i expected no theres just been some situations that just havent really gone our way from a car standpoint you look at how fast we were at kentucky and we werent quick enough i was running flat out behind scott and i just couldnt keep up we havent always had the fastest cars but thats just sometimes how the seasons go but if we can end strongly that will certainly change the way people see the season out
6919791 its for the fans so its good they can appreciate whos on a championship run and who is not it was a great idea and i enjoy being a part of it for sure
6919792 i think that being fourth the pressure is a lot higher because im trying to catch the other guys hopefully i can do well and keep the white ring tires for the next few races
6919793 if there is a team that knows how to rebound its team penske again they did a fantastic job they tried to make sure i dont feel a difference and to be honest i dont the car is basically the same i keep joking that the seat that i loved burned up but the one i have here is very similar its a good start for whats been a tough two days to finish the day in p1 is a great deal but tomorrow is a bigger deal and so is the race so were going to keep working hard
6919794 not really we tested here last week for the first time since about january i didnt test but ryan briscoe tested actually it wasnt even ryan it was romain dumas it just proves that a little bit of laps around this place helps a lot we may not have gone fast but it helps eliminate some things you may have tried today it was just one lap but i tell you everyone will come back tomorrow and try to go fast again
6919795 it was a good day for the team 7 eleven guys we worked on the qualifying setup in the morning and we concentrated on the race in the afternoon session im pretty pleased with how today went were going to try and maximize our situation and finish as high as we can in the championship im just working on winning some more races for the team after you win the championship finishing second third fourth or fifth i dont think will make a big difference obviously we are working toward a real possibility that there will be a big fight between me and dan wheldon for the third position in the championship if you look at helio castroneves and scott dixon they are so consistent right now that i think its going to be really difficult to catch them so im foc used on winning races
6919796 it helped kv racing technology to come here to test last week it brought us closer to the established teams which is where we want to be but we still need to keep working its getting very close to the end of the season and everyone is very eager to win so it is good that we are in the ballpark for the pole we still have all day tomorrow and then the race on sunday before it is decided until then we will keep on learning and trying new things with the car overall i am happy with the progress we are making
6919797 it was very difficult to get a good lap in with so many cars on track but the aussie vineyards team australia car was quick we still need to work some things out to make the car a little bit better our aim for tomorrow is to not only make the firestone fast six but to be right up at the front
6919798 we had a good day today in the delphi national guard car we knew we would have a good package after the test last week and luckily that translated into today there was an issue this morning with our braking but the panther guys were able to fix that during the break and you could see how quick we were this afternoon were happy with fifth position overall in practice today and look forward to making a run at the firestone fast six tomorrow
6919799 today we mainly worked on our qualifying setup qualifying on road courses this year has been really competitive so we want to be sure that we know what we have in the car for tomorrow were happy with the car even though we werent at the top of the speed charts we put on a new set of tires right before the end of the session but we were unable to post a time well just continue working in the morning and hope for the best come qualifying in the afternoon i have to say that im super proud of our crew with the way that they have handled the adversity in the wake of the transporter fire they have been working really hard since they landed yesterday to make sure that i have what i need in the car and i have no complaints
6919800 i am happy with the way the motorola car did today in both practice sessions we found some direction on some things that we needed and i feel really good about the direction that the car is going hopefully we will continue to build from the practices into qualifying tomorrow i am hopeful that the motorola car will be in the firestone fast six at the end of the day
6919801 the blockbuster star clone wars car was not too bad today i still think we have some room to improve we had our best most consistent balance at the end of the afternoon session once we are able to put new tires on that car we should be able to be pretty good
6919802 we had an electrical problem in the first practice session and i made a mistake on the second session causing the formula dream car to go off the track fortunately the car wasnt damaged and the car is getting better so hopefully we will be able to have a good practice session tomorrow morning and do well in the qualifying
6919803 i thought i checked up i dont know who got in the back of me and lifted the back tires off the ground i had no control i was going to go low it is a shame the camping world chevrolet was good we knew johnny benson pitted and we were just trying to gain some points on him i didnt know he was running sixth but with 20 something laps to go we had to stay out we needed one more stop to make the truck good enough to beat those guys but we still had a good enough truck to run in the top five its a shame and i hate to see that happen its tough on the points
6919804 with the midget its all about having seat time and getting comfortable with the car with this only being my third year of full time usac midget series racing i think im finally beginning to get into a rhythm when i compete in one of these cars this time last season our dirt program really began to step up and we were able to get our first win around this time of the year i am really looking forward to going back to angell park this weekend i know were very prepared and i think we have a good shot at putting chevy and bass pro shops up front on both nights
6919805 the history behind midget racing in the sun prairie area is what makes it such a great track to compete at this type of racing is a fan favorite in the wisconsin region and its always a great time getting to talk with the fans after the night is over they really support the sport and their local race tracks and thats a pretty neat environment to come into as a driver i would love to put my name and tony stewart racing in the books as an angell park speedway feature winner hopefully thats the outcome we see this weekend
6919806 leading the points doesnt necessarily take your focus off the race to race aspect of the championship youre always aware of where you sit in the point standings you ultimately have to win races in order to win the championship or to stay ahead of the competition were always focused on how we can win the next race its a process that never stops our dirt midget program is doing well this year and i am confident that were in a good position heading up to angell park this weekend
6919807 normally i run at angell park several times during a season this year ive only had an opportunity to compete at the track one time during our regular season i went up on an off week from our usac racing schedule to compete im very familiar with angell park or sun prairie as we call it and i am looking forward to racing there this weekend
6919808 i was able to win the pepsi nationals at angell park a few years ago and that was a really cool achievement the competition up there is really tough there are a lot of guys who can win on any given night id really like to win the hall of fame classic this weekend and put chevy and bass pro shops in the winners circle for the first time i think were going to have really good cars and that its a possibility for this tsr team
6919809 throughout the season the performance indicator that the driver has received is based on percentages how many cars how many were inverted and all of the other factors are in relation to the track within the other tracks
6919810 the number of races part is a number that doesnt float its solid

6919841 ernie cope crew chief and the guys gave me a great truck
6919842 prior to qualifying we changed everything the entire setup after qualifying i felt like we were going to have a good race i was really saving my stuff after our only pit stop i knew that i was going to have to race that set of tires a while so i was conserving and trying to stay out of trouble by the end of the race we were a top three or four truck with about 20 laps to go there was that wreck in one and two by the time i figured out what was going on hornaday had the brakes locked up and so did i i got into him and ruined his night i hate that we got together after that it was just survival my night was over too

6919849 were excited about everything the foundation is doing and were thrilled we brought a new component to the event with the helmet of hope

6919864 were fortunate enough not to have lost anybody on that day
6919865 it was just the atmosphere from that day it was filled with such sorrow and it was such a negative time we just wanted to contribute something positive thats the idea of why we entered the competition
6919866 the design had to be like no other because 9 11 was a day like no other
6919867 we wanted it to capture the magnitude of the events that played out that day

6919871 however my active involvement with the guild didnt begin until my son was hospitalized in 2003 at three years old he caught influenza and had to be placed in isolation for an extended period the amazing care he received spurred my need to become part of the organization
6919872 the guild is a significant provider of funds for st john
6919873 the hospital petitions us whenever they have a need the guild then works to fulfill their request recently for example the guild purchased a machine to supplement the hospitals groundbreaking work in cardiac research and a software system for patient tracking through the emergency department
6919874 i want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
6919875 this is his decision and i expect him to make it however he feels is best

6919878 rows of vegetable trays bins overflowing with icy soda and huge bags of chips covered the tables hundreds of dollars worth of food was donated specifically for this event reaffirming why we have been costco members forever their community support deserves to be applauded
6919879 all i can say is yo jamaican sprinters are taking over the world
6919880 what i do i do for myself my coach and the fans im just showing my personality
6919881 that ryder cup is there a couple of weeks away when he makes that decision
6919882 im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible
6919883 i want to make that team i think i could help that team i think i would be a good addition but its hard when im thinking about that and when im trying to play golf here too
6919884 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth even though we are out east this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere
6919885 the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6919886 i feel a little more pressure to tell you the truth coming into this week just because of that reason trying to make the team
6919887 ive got two things going on at one time and im trying my best to separate them out
6919888 ive been on the other end of the spectrum from two other captains on a sunday night saying were not going to pick you
6919889 it was a good summer and it was enjoyable hitting with a wood bat
6919890 i also caught for some really pitchers which really helped me out
6919891 anytime you can go out and get 100 plus at bats it gives a player good experience
6919892 i was able to go out and implement some stuff gary ward taught me and it really helped
6919893 were on the right track with the race cars thats for sure we just need to change our luck somehow and well be fine
6919894 we had a very fast car at dixie until the fuel pump let go i just hate it for everyone on this team chad was really bummed but its part of paying your dues and just needs to keep his head up
6919895 were running both cars so we have two chances to try and break our bad luck streak we were really good at dixie before dropping out so hopefully we can build from there and get a solid run in one of the two races preferably both
6919896 we are gaining little by little in our program but we just need stayed focused and good things will come our way
6919897 were looking forward to milwaukee were going to pull some double duty and hopefully crack the top five in both races
6919898 as we continue to sponsor the team along with paul davis restoration inc we are committed to providing support to scott for his work on behalf of finding a cure for als our companys mission to support those in need is at the heart of our core values paul davis restoration and remodeling of southeast wisconsin supports the race team and many additional non profit organizations through the paul davis charitable foundation
6919899 i think people will catch up to us throughout the weekend
6919900 the car was really strong from the beginning of the test it was really good right out of the trailer the afs andretti green crew did a fantastic job and i just have to thank them for that i think well improve a little bit more but i think everyone else will improve as well hopefully we can maintain the advantage that we have so we can fight for the pole be in good shape for the race and the championship
6919901 we had a really productive test day last week that i almost wish we had earlier on in the season because we found a lot of stuff and this being my home track i have a lot of track knowledge i think were looking pretty good i think thats a pretty competitive time i think some of the other guys used an extra set of tires and we didnt we just used one set throughout the day i think well be looking pretty good for tomorrow
6919902 having a lead does help your confidence but theres a long way to go so we have to take it one weekend at a time looking race by race
6919903 ive won cup races before big titles like a f3 fia world championship one off event or two events so far ive never won a long distance championship but ive watched people do it before and they take it race by race and be as humble as they can i have no choice but to be humble because im not exactly running away with a 200 point lead
6919904 its a big race for us last year it was definitely a turning point for us chasing for the championship we came up a bit short but this year is looking a lot better so far coming back here having done so well here last year were definitely looking forward to that
6919905 were going to do everything we can to finish ahead of dixon hopefully as far ahead of him as possible
6919906 weve been trying to do that all season were looking good infineon is a place where we feel comfortable
6919907 if theres a team that can rebound from something like this its team penske
6919908 theyve done it before and were going to do it again its tough because you have some small bits seats for example i loved the seat that i had and im going to have to use the spare one little details the car was prepared for here my guys are going to do what they can were going to go out there put that behind us and hopefully that will give us even more motivation to go out there and do well
6919909 it really comes down to the amount of work that has to be done the material things arent easy and everybody has to write checks but the difficult part is the amount of time and effort that goes into the customization of the race cars and the trailer and the pit equipment and that type of thing thats where the biggest loss really is its time from a financial perspective its never easy and never fun but you run a similar risk every weekend when you crash a race car
6919910 the transporter is about 350 000 or 400 000 along with the contents obviously you have two race cars at the end of the day you can say theyre 400 000 you can say theyre 600 000 but who knows there are certain parts of the car that are going to be salvageable and certain parts that arent total estimate is probably more than one million dollars and less than three million dollars
6919911 what we brought here today are very small things very unique tools things you cant buy ill put it that way customization type things things that will come tomorrow on the straight truck are basically the things that we see are somewhat unscathed and easily utilized
6919912 im confident that with the quality of our people anytime we bring a backup car to the racetrack that backup car should be prepared as if its going to become a race car otherwise we shouldnt really have it here at the level we participate at the question will really be if we need to go to a back up car at what state the back up car is going to be in for the weekend
6919913 its our goal to be sure that theyre not but that chance is probably more so than what it would be on a different given weekend
6919914 roger goes right into the technical whys and wherefores of how does that happen what happened whats the extent of the damage the first question he asked was if everybody is ok but beyond that it becomes more of a methodical process with roger theres usually not a lot of emotions on anything rogers pretty much to the point with what the process is going to be and how are we going to be sure that this doesnt affect the outcome of sundays race thats the game
6919915 ive called races before where we basically just had a computer and a radio so the things you get used to and whats necessary and whats a luxury are kind of two different things
6919916 its been uphill for me here at infineon so thats good i look forward to coming back here more and more every year i think as i mature as a driver i understand a little bit better what i need out of the car and am able to do what i need to do on the track to go fast im slowly but surely learning im excited to be here again
6919917 theres always one area of the track thats a very slow corner i dont think its going to make much of a difference i didnt test here a week or two ago marco andretti did i think its definitely made it a very clear hairpin turn now i know that there was ability to pass there before with the way the track was set up but maybe with it being even slower now there will be even more so well just have to see how it goes no matter what its still going to be the same great sonoma with just a hint of a change
6919918 jeff simmons has done a great job for us this season he had us in the championship hunt even though he didnt compete in the first race of the season
6919919 at this point in time tom wood and i have decided to take the opportunity to have a look at jonathans road course ability in preparation for the 2009 driver line up with talks continuing with pablo donoso this race will give us the chance to look at how they work as teammates
6919920 i am very thankful for the opportunity to drive with team moore racing this year and proud of my performance and the contributions i was able to make in the development of the car
6919921 i knew from the very first event we did together that it was going to be race to race one of the main goals was to attract good drivers with sponsorship funding behind them to the team we were able to do that and i hope that will put the team in a stronger financial position to be competitive
6919922 i want to thank tom and mark for their consideration and wanting me in their car

6919933 we have asked the pentagon to allow a six month timetable for submittal of proposals in this competition
6919934 the reason were asking for that is since the issuance of the draft request for proposal rfp two weeks ago as weve engaged in our discussions with the pentagon and theyre asking for a different kind of airplane than they asked for in the first competition
6919935 if we dont get the sufficient time to prepare that proposal theres really little option for us other than to no bid in this competition
6919936 this is a new competition make no mistake about that the requirements have changed
6919937 the proposal will have the specific timelines in it im not going to get into it now and whether or not a company desires to compete is entirely up to them

6919958 its certainly a great honor to be with roger penske and to have him have the confidence in you to put you in as a rookie crew chief especially with where we are right now in the top 35 as important as it is for our team to run well its a great honor you know i kind of look as something that ive been working towards its something that ive been building on for a long time and even prior to this in my driving career i kind of always knew that this might be a pretty good fallback plan for me and thats why i went for my engineering degree and got the technical background i needed to handle this side of it its a great honor its an awesome bunch of guys it was a fun practice for me because it was a lot of new faces a lot of new people but ive already kind of built a lot of faith in them already a lot of confidence having a team thats already up and running is kind of the perfect case for me to get in i didnt have all winter to worry about it think about it i found out monday im after it this is all ive been worrying about from now on and thats cool for me thats the way racing is its the way our schedule is
6919959 my experience on paper may not be a lot you look at it and ive been a race engineer for a couple of years now and have had an opportunity to work with crew chiefs that did consult me a lot of those decisions and thats really helped me so that when that pressure is on okay i can still make those decisions because before i was playing it through my head how i would do everything and then i try to suggest it and they take it for what it was worth and we either would or we wouldnt and then id try to evaluate on that its like okay i can evaluate his plan and mine at the same time and figure out which one is going to work better i enjoy that side of it as far as how much engineering is there i feel like there is very little and i feel like thats where i really rely on my racing background to kind of play in as a strength there engineering school doesnt teach you when you pit at a road course it doesnt teach you what two or four is going to do to your car ive been going racing every weekend since i was a little kid is what teaches you how to make that work
6919960 weve just got to get as a company running better i think there is no mystery that the 2 and the 12 are kind of in the same boat that we are we all need to perform better part of that is getting is just getting to work better with all the new stuff but i think as far as the 77 goes obviously we need to be in the top 35 thats a forgone conclusion and its something that i dont really think about that much its just going racing and points take care of themselves i want to be able to feel like that weve got a 13 race foundation built to go into next year and forget about worrying about top 35 and just worry about running in the top 10 i think this team has the potential and i know sam has the potential to get himself to a top 15 car every week and thats where we hope to finish out the season
