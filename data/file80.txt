800013 i work for a large insurance company i am a nurse reviewer who approves or denies claims for members we have to go by each insurance contract that each company has believe me the public has no clue what and how much infrastructure goes into the insurance industry i have no trouble believing that if we cut out the middleman that there will be more than enough money for universal healthcare profit has no place in healthcare
800014 the nurses dont actually deny the claims we review the policy and then send it to the physician reviewers with a recommendation to deny the actual denial is the physicians responsibility his id number and name goes on the denial if i recommend denial it is still their decision to deny he can approve the claim even if a nurse recommends denial i cant speak for pacificare and how they run their company but ultimately we have to go by policy if i approve something that is against the policy i will get in hot water

800153 by just not letting that water disappear down the drain we are saving and then reusing around 32 400 cubic meters of precious water in a year and that in turn saves the hotel approximately us 20 000 per year
800154 located on a private beach overlooking the pristine azure waters surrounding cebus mactan island we are very concerned with preserving our environment as it is a huge part of our business however any hotel anywhere in the world can see the excellent improvement this has made to our bottom line and consider both the economic and eco friendly benefits of saving an important resource such as water
800155 whilst transaction activity has shown a marked decline from the historical highs achieved over the last two years we are still cautiously optimistic about the future of hotel investments over the medium term
800156 at 13 9 billion hotel investment volumes are now at a level comparable to that of 2004 which similarly recorded 14 0 billion worth of transactions within the first half of the year
800157 more importantly transaction volumes are still significantly higher than those achieved in 2002 2003 which remains the lowest point for the industry in this decade
800158 following the events of september 11 2001 the iraq war and the sars outbreak in 2003 transaction volumes sunk to a low of 3 6 billion in the first half of 2002 and remained weak through the end of 2003 based on year to date numbers the hotel investment market in 2008 appears to be in a much stronger position relative to the 2002 2003 period
800159 on the other hand with the weaker trading outlook anticipated for most markets sellers are expected to start adjusting to new pricing levels

800176 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars

800187 after some time mr saxena came to mr argal s residence alongwith with a person and delivered rs 1 crore advance money
800188 the video recording would show that one of the persons present there seeks mr saxena s mobile number
800189 if during the period when mr saxena was at the residence of mr argal the telephone records show repeated calls to the phone installed at the sp leader s residence and the video recording shows that he dialed the phone repeatedly to get the mps to speak to mr amar singh there cannot be a more clinching evidence the bjp leader argued
800190 in every other state junior doctors are paid much higher we have to work with minimum infrastructure we have no security no fixed work hours and yet have to take the maximum workload this simply cannot continue we are going ahead with the strike whoever wants to can join us
800191 services will definitely be hit if junior doctors are not working we have asked senior doctors to be available from early morning in any case emergency and operation theatres will face an acute problem
800192 there is no point in calling a strike now and harassing people
800193 the kjrc backed organisations will set up camps around the tata motors factory site the agitation will start at 2 pm on that day and will continue till 400 acres are returned to farmers
800194 most villagers are not too keen to be part of the rally some villagers have already started working as casual labourers at the car plant some of them dont want any more trouble the rest have realised that they can never get back their land and have resigned themselves to fate
800195 in many ways the hype over the potential impact of web 2 0 is similar to the way the internet was first presented to the insurance industry in the
800196 the grand visions of web 2 0 are obscuring the real value that insurers are creating today by making it faster easier and cheaper for employees to share information and knowledge
800197 web 2 0 is pushing the boundaries of what todays interactive web sites can do however in the rush to add features security often becomes an afterthought
800198 during our presentation at black hat we will demonstrate and share the source code of jinx a fully implemented javascript malware which is the creation of our research that unlocks a number of interesting vulnerabilities within many web 2 0 operating environments including the popular mozilla product line
800199 the mass collaboration of web 2 0 and the power of social networking can radically change the face of government and improve the effectiveness of delivering services to citizens
800200 the beauty of web 2 0 is that boundaries get broken down
800201 the underlying issue is that youve got to be able to do trusted computing from anywhere even non trusted computers and dont leave a path behind of your transactions but were still spending time and attention on how were building security in big systems

800213 the depths of misery for poison ivy sufferers is unmatched in my opinion
800214 because it comes in a container with a small applicator brush on the top the material comes out only thru the brush which makes it very easy to get the stuff only on the plant to be dispatched whats really neat is the weed dies when only six or eight inches of the base of the stem are brushed with the herbicide it also works in the winter
800215 let me second the effectiveness of vine x the active ingredient is triclopyr which you can buy in many other herbicides but that brush is really handy and environmentally smart keeps the herbicide where it belongs
800216 if contacted affected areas should be washed immediately with soap and water as well as any clothing or objects that may have come in contact with the oil
800217 after coming in contact with the allergen the best way to prevent skin irritation is to pour a mild solvent such as isopropyl alcohol rubbing alcohol over the exposed area and then follow this with plenty of cold water warm water enhances penetration of the oil within a few minutes of exposure
800218 using only a small amount of water or disposable hand wipes is more likely to spread the toxin than remove it soaps can be used to wash but only if used with copious amounts of water otherwise they too will spread the toxin
800219 so water temperature is definitely a detail over which disagreement persists
800220 if a rash develops after exposure to poison oak the use of a product called tecnu which is sold at most drug stores will relieve the itch and reduce the rash when applied once a day it stops the itching for most of the day and clears up the rash in about 7 days

800275 this arises out of the concern about the high and rising food prices and their impact on the poorest in the country
800276 but given the current impact of high food prices and its global its clear that you are faced with a systemic challenge with regard to this some structural challenge which is affecting the whole world
800277 and therefore you need an agency which is kind of more permanent less ad hoc with greater capacity to look at the entirety of the food system not only as it affects us but within the global context so that we respond to this bearing in mind it is what seems to be a long term feature of both the domestic and global economy
800278 particularly given the impact of high food prices on poor people

800332 we believe it s important to expose our residents to life after the grove living here is pretty sweet with no worries about roommates not paying rent or bills and the luxury of having a full amenity package at their fingertips we don t want them having total culture shock when it s time to enter the real world
800333 we know college is stressful so we help balance that stress with a lot of fun we put together themed parties like peace love grove event where students wear tie dyed grove shirts love beads and participate in green days
800334 other ways we help residents relax are through fitness classes pool parties monday night football parties and movie nights
800335 our events are successful because they are led and organized by our community assistants peers attending the same university when residents feel a part of something they are more likely to stay where they are making our residents better makes the grove a better place
800336 one way we help residents is through designing programs to help them look at things from a different vantage point for example in one of our past events residents helped blow up hot air balloons and took tethered balloon rides illustrating how different things look when you see them from a new perspective

800338 the mexican side of the border is essentially a war zone with the mexican government fighting losing or sometimes in collusion with the heavily armed drug cartels you re not going to see much about it in the mainstream media and for some reason this just isnt a topic anymore

800343 he was a distributor of narcotics up the east coast and he was lowered down under a ruse to come down and see the mexican suppliers here in atlanta and when he went to a house just in the metro area he was pulled into a garage where seven armed men took him took him out essentially beat him brought him down into the basement of this house where he was shackled in this unfinished basement and his hands were cuffed then they took rolls of duct tape and essentially his entire face his nose pretty much everything was just covered with tape and over the course of a week we became aware of this and what we ended up doing glenn through a number of different investigative means we found the house where this individual was being held and what we did was we conducted a rescue operation and this individual when we found him was chained in the basement severely dehydrated and he was beaten as well and we saved his life
800344 not a lot of people because nobody is really covering this in the mainstream media according to beck google or click on young girl raped and beheaded in florida by mexican traffickers

800365 it is not enough that your legislature should be numerous it should also be divided
800366 what would or should we do if in the post june 30th period a so called sovereign iraqi government asks us to leave even if we are unhappy about the security situation there
800367 well if that scenario evolves than i think its obvious that we would have to leave because if it was an elected government of iraq and weve been asked to leave other places in the world if it were an extremist government then i think we would have other challenges but i dont see how we could stay when our whole emphasis and policy has been based on turning the iraqi government over to the iraqi people
800368 progress has been due primarily to an increase in the number of troops and a change in their strategy
800369 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there
800370 our troops have performed brilliantly in lowering the level of violence

800425 im thrilled at the number of bendigo residents who are taking advantage of the new and improved bus services
800426 patronage data shows strong growth across the network and im very pleased these services have been well received by the bendigo community
800427 were getting a lot more inquiries from people who openly tell us that they dont usually use the bus but that because of petrol theyre finding new ways to go to work and do the other things they need to do he said
800428 one of the things that ive noticed particularly in the last two months is people inquiring a lot about buses because petrol is getting too expensive
800429 im amazed that the general publics feedback to the media has been basically nil theyre just not buying into the argument he said
800430 but the general thrust of everything weve learnt is that passengers want to be in mitchell street

800432 on saturday we had so many police officers out we werent really faced with any major problems acting sergeant craig pearce said

800441 the bendigo community deserves a genuine conversation to canvass all proposals and ideas for fortuna
800442 closed door discussions by mr gibbons with the city council are no substitute for the real thing
800443 i am appalled mr gibbons has failed to engage the wider community and when pressured to show some leadership can only respond with childish utterances dismissing the option of a one dollar concessional sale of fortuna to the local community
800444 mr gibbons has already dudded bendigo twice in eight months an 8 million gp superclinic has been scaled back to a 5 million price tag and the rudd government was 500 000 short in its funding for the chinese precinct development
800445 now the rudd government and mr gibbons are setting themselves up to inflict a nasty trifecta on the people of bendigo
800446 senator ronaldson is well aware that fortuna was earmarked for sale in may 2004 when the howard government wanted to move current fortuna tenants defence imaging and geospatial organisation to canberra
800447 and he and his liberal colleagues had to be dragged kicking and screaming to agree to keep digo in bendigo and only after an intensive campaign by the bendigo community
800448 i must say its good to see senator ronaldson taking an interest in bendigo once again after eight months of deafening silence
800449 its just a pity that when senator ronaldson does say something about bendigo its the same old carping from his spring street lair in melbourne
800450 now that hes in opposition his hypocrisy about fortuna is breathtaking he has completed a triple backflip with pike and is desperately trying to restore his credibility in bendigo mr gibbons said

800462 barack hussein obama is an anti semite who will brutally pressure tiny israel to commit national suicide obama also supports muslim terrorist iran and the rest of the jew hating islamic world
800463 obama is anti american as well and his pro muslim radical left wing policies endanger the very survival of the united states and western civilization
800464 therefore jews who support obama are self hating jews who are working to elect an anti semitic anti israel and anti american president who despite all of his lying denials was in fact born and raised as a muslim jews for obama and any other prominent jewish obama supporters to debate us on these subjects stop hiding behind the obama worshipping biased news media come out and refute any of our charges if you can in a public forum where both sides are afforded equal time to present their cases if you refuse to debate it will only further prove that obama supporters are unwilling and unable to defend their candidate when presented with the truth

800491 for vidalia we had these 10 songs and that was what we did no debate about it we werent recording with friends anymore
800492 we had one or two completed were good at coming up with ideas but not so good at finishing them
800493 the essential difference between the two is that vidalia we pieced together in chunks with a lot of overdubs

800498 truth is there are very few people being healed in lakeland i have worked with charisma magazine editor lee grady in discovering how many false reports have been released as facts
800499 charisma reporters and a few others like myself have tried to get these verified and cannot we actually had offered to help because any news of a resurrection in my opinion is world news if it can be validated but then when the totals continued to mount which led to hype and embellishment they began to ask us to stop asking questions
800500 friday night todd said that god said there were 1000 people that were to give 1000 and they were to receive a 1000 fold blessing the one hour drama on this giving subject was so deceptively evident that it was embarrassing to watch on top of that those that would give that money were able to come to the platform to be recognized
800501 i am praying for todd because he really is an evangelist and he is a gifted evangelist but he cannot go on embellishing speaking untruths hyping manipulating shoving kicking slapping leg dropping and bamming his way on the pulpit without consequences god will not be mocked and todd and others must answer to him for everyone led astray
800502 the biggest thing about lakeland is the lack of the fear of our awesome god lack of repentance and humility

800543 the poem of the apocalypse presupposes in the young evangelist a complete system and traditions individually developed by himself it is written in the form of a vision and weaves into a brilliant framework of poetry the whole erudition the whole thought of african civilization an inspired bard the author touches upon a series of ruling events he draws in bold outlines the history of society from cataclysm to cataclysm and even further still the truths which he reveals are prophecies brought from far and wide of which he is the resounding echo he is the voice which cries the voice which chants the harmonies of the desert and prepares paths for the light his speech peals forth with mastery and compels faith for he carries among savage nations the oracles of lao and unveils him who is the first born of the sun for the admiration of civilizations to come the theory of the four ages is found in the apocalypse as it is also in the books of zoroaster and in the bible the gradual reconstruction of primeval federations of the reign of god among peoples emancipated from the yoke of tyrants and the bonds of error are foretold clearly for the end of the fourth age and the recurrence of the cataclysm exhibited at first from afar is portrayed in the fulness of time the description of the cataclysm and its duration the new world emerging from the waves and spreading in all its beauty under heaven the great serpent bound for a time by an angel in the depths of the abyss finally the dawn of that age to come prophesied by the word who appeared to the apostle at the beginning of the poem his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength such is ormuz osiris chourien the lamb the christ the ancient of days the man of the time and the river celebrated by daniel he is the first and the last who was who must be alpha and omega beginning and end he holds the key of mysteries in his hands he opens the great abyss of central fire where death sleeps beneath the canopy of darkness where sleeps the great serpent awaiting the wakening of the ages

800568 mais nous voulons quil comprenne le contexte de ce que les m ls veulent dire
800569 ou encore inspirer de linconnu expirer de linconnu cest la respiration ordinaire de la conscience
800570 ill state something rash she had the most amazing smile i bet you didnt expect that
800571 tell your boyfriend if he says hes got beef that im a vegetarian and i aint fuckin scared of him
800572 whether water is necessary for life is i think very dubious
800573 life on earth learned to work with water because its the only liquid that is really abundant i dont think theres anything magic about it
800574 the dogma a few decades ago was that enzymes wouldnt work at all in non aqueous media
800575 but under some conditions enzymes can be very active in liquids other than water and that has been surprising
800576 we havent yet established the limits of enzyme function in terms of the range of liquids temperatures and pressures in which enzymes will work
800577 you can imagine minor differences but the hammer of biological selection is powerful stuff and the best comes out the pipe
800578 even if its built by different atoms i bet the cellular machinery will still look familiar
800579 if theres life on titan its probably quite exotic quite different from life on earth
800580 we would have to refine our understanding so we know what to look for
800581 if you look at environments where there isnt any oxygen and trace water then silicon chemistry becomes more plausible
800582 if you reached out with your space glove it could feel living flexible floppy
800583 but im not at all optimistic about finding non carbon life
800584 we know that enzymes can catalyse reactions in the vapour phase
800585 no one has ever duplicated the controls of the lr response on mars without resorting to biology
800586 except the by product is not h2o like on earth its h2o2
800587 when you heat those poor little suckers they pop and the h2o2 oxidises all of the organics in the cells
800588 they are only harsh solvents once water gets into the act
800589 dry sulphuric acid and dry hydrogen fluoride are very mild solvents if anything
800590 extender los lbumes de figuritas a la siguiente dimensi n con augmented reality
800591 no we just never talk about these things and it would be weird
800592 if youre going to continue this pregnancy we need to make sure that everythings healthy if you dont want to weve got about a week left based on when your last periods were if youre going to have an abortion if youre going to parent either way i think its time tell someone whats going on you need a little help
800593 we can get an emergency grant to cover most of the cost of the surgery we can waive much of the rest what we need from you to do is talk to someone at home about this youre going to need a ride and it doesnt sound like youve got another 200 for a cab ride right
800594 whatever you choose you know that you need some medical care to either see us and not be pregnant or start some prenatal care right
800595 im really okay with all of this i know it doesnt look that way we live in my in laws basement we cant have another baby right now i have an eight month old at home we dont even have a place of our own to live
800596 i had a cesarean for my baby shes just eight months and shes beautiful but
800597 im just so scared to have another surgery i know that i have to be put asleep and its just really scary
800598 carrie ann tell me about when your daughter was born
800599 i started as soon as i found out that i was pregnant we did all these classes we did the lamaze classes then we took the bradley classes you know the ones for the husband so that he can be the coach we were gonna do it together
800600 then i was at my due date and nothing no contractions nothing we practiced so much a few days later i thought my water had broken so we got all the bags and went to the hospital and when we got there her heart rate it kept changing going up and down they didnt even let me have any labor we didnt know what was going on it was just doctors saying it was an emergency and bright lights everywhere they just stripped me down and shaved me and the next thing i know they took me into the or owen was there but he didnt know what to do i was all doctors i didnt know and i couldnt feel anything
800601 yes i just know that its going to be like that again we had practiced so much and we both just froze i know that he feels bad too we were supposed to be there for each other and we both just froze he thinks he really let me down maybe i blame him a little bit too that he couldnt do anything i know that shes healthy and thats supposed to be the only thing that matters but i didnt even get to have any contractions this thing you know its been like a wedge between us and we practiced so much
800602 you know today is different its not an emergency we can take our time it seems like youre really scared about being asleep
800603 carrie ann maybe this sounds crazy but we dont have to have all those elements that are scary to you your birth was really scary and i dont want today to feel like that you and your husband spent all this time practicing your relaxation techniques together i know that its not exactly what youd practiced for but what if you were awake for the abortion rather than asleep many women compare the feeling of the abortion to working through one contraction it takes about the same amount of time as one long one when you had your birth you didnt have a lot of choice in what was about to happen it was an emergency and you did what had to be done to help your daughter maybe you could use this as an chance to use what you learned about in your lamaze classes it could be an opportunity to work together in a different way and really be there for each other like you wanted to be when your daughter was born this time youre in control maybe this could be something healing between you
800604 i had a disappointing birth experience i felt out of control i am pregnant again
800605 abortion is what happens when there is little or no education and or poverty that restricts access to birth control
800606 can i have an abortion and still be a good person
800607 a guide to emotional and spiritual resolution after an abortion
800608 women provide abortions and have abortions because if they dont they perceive they cant be equal to men
800609 i cannot share a child with the man abusing me
800610 just turn a scared 19 year old out on the street because she did not make the right choice
800611 i wouldnt want to bet on what the japanese are going to choose
800612 no one can tell you how the edge plasma will behave in a machine we havent built yet
800613 its become an urban legend in our field that the casimir effect somehow measures quantum zero point energy
800614 must have something to do with the zero point energy
800615 we have no way of measuring the energy in the vacuum nor any properties of the vacuum in the context of our laboratory experiments
800616 the demonstration in the casimir effect of the reality of zero point fluctuations
800617 the vacuum fluctuations themselves are very real as evidenced by the casimir effect
800618 the vacuum field energy is so large that the universe would have blown apart or squeezed back to a point long before we would ever know about it
800619 with vacuum fluctuations we have to distinguish between evidence for the existence of the fluctuations and for their energy
800620 you think you get rid of them but then they creep in the back door
800621 to me the reality of zero point fluctuations in the casimir case means neither more nor less than the existence of a force between conductors
800622 you can see the image of a person in the flames and i think it is the servant of god pope john paul ii
800623 it was only afterwards when i got home and looked at the pictures that i realised i had something
800624 i showed them to my brother and sister and they like me were convinced the flames had formed the image of pope john paul ii
800625 i was so happy with the picture that i showed it to our local bishop who said that pope john paul had made many pilgrimages during his life and he was still making them in death
800626 if you really want to hear about it the first thing youll probably want to know is where i was born and what my lousy childhood was like and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me and all that david copperfield kind of crap but i dont feel like going into it if you want to know the truth in the first place that stuff bores me and in the second place my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if i told anything pretty personal about them
800627 hop a long cassidy and forex kid live at est 08 30
800628 if the prices are high it may be time to sell and if the prices are low it may be a time to buy
800629 it will be suicide to use the high leverage without close stops
800630 hey if you get back call me well have a party
800631 papa last night they gave me a reception on the rooftop underneath the stars overlooking the mediterranean
800632 son a reception on the rooftop underneath the stars overlooking the mediterranean
800633 there are many virtues and values but heres the greatest one person caring for another
800634 i mrs nesbitt being a resident of the north riding of yorkshire declare that yorkshire is three ridings and the city of york with these boundaries of 1124 years standing that the address of all places in these ridings is yorkshire that all persons born therein or resident therein and loyal to the ridings are yorkshire men and women that any person or corporate body which deliberately ignores or denies the aforementioned shall forfeit all claim to yorkshire status these declarations made this yorkshire day 2008 god save the queen
800635 everything ive done over the past 20 years has taught me that seti as currently practised is not the most sensible thing to do
800636 because a patterned signal is so inefficient it is very unlikely to be the kind of thing used by an advanced technology
800637 the only way to do it is by a process of elimination
800638 we can then say that what is left over may be an intelligent signal
800639 even if we were to find a transmission containing the digits of pi it is always possible that a natural process could be generating it
800640 the question is this an intelligent signal is very unlikely to have a simple yes no answer
800641 they may use a deliberately beamed beacon that by design will be energy inefficient directional and easily detected by our present methods
800642 it would mean tailoring a signal for a civilisation that has developed radio communication but has not yet developed efficient radio communication
800643 all artefacts will be as complicated if not more than natures
800644 we can look for extraterrestrial intelligence in the physical universe or in the computational universe
800645 but the task is a lot easier in the computational universe and theres a lot more there
800646 the truth is it is more efficient for us to simply search the computational universe ourselves
800647 what could extraterrestrials tell us apart from weve done more computations than you and here are some good algorithms weve found
800648 its a redefinition of abortion that does not match any of the current medical definitions its ideologically based and not based on science and could interfere with the development of many new therapies to treat diseases
800649 cest au moment m me o sa t te rencontra le sol quil se rendit compte que son corps tait plus lourd que son r ve
800650 its too bad youre such an ass if it wasnt for your looks youd actually be a man lol
800651 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
800652 they leave the security council no choice but to increase the sanctions as called for in the last resolution passed
800653 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
800654 chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
800655 throughout the investigation and prosecution of this case the anc president has had his rights repeatedly violated by institutions of state
800656 shell need our support because she may not be as self confident as you and i

800675 s vim dizer que vamos trabalhar mais em busca da recupera o
800676 a vida n o feita s de rosas mas de espinhos tamb m em um momento como esse era mais do que oportuno que nos apresent ssemos para dirimir quest es que estivessem incomodando a opini o publica

800681 we understand the green issue and we dont want to prohibit that but want to make sure its done in a safe way
800682 ik stop onderweg wel nog even aan de bilbo is dat een probleem voor u
800683 its a good thing you can do this more than once because i sucked
800684 we have confirmation now that 145 people have been killed
800685 we found eight to 10 stones which had fallen off and probably scared the people causing the stampede
800686 many children and women were shouting for help and i saw people tumbling down the hillside
800687 there were rumors of boulders coming down on us and we all ran like the others
800688 we need more medicines and blood but we are trying to do our best with what we have
800689 there were too many rumors we tried our best to keep things under control but it went out of hand
800690 hertz is constantly innovating and expanding our service offering to ensure that we cater for every type of traveller scooters provide a fun convenient and easy mode of transport for the adventurous and young at heart
800691 i just had to be comfortable over it towards the end it got kind of shaky
800692 it was to a point where it didnt matter what the bike was the size or what the capability was
800693 they knew they wanted a scooter they knew it was hot they knew if they didnt buy it right then it would go away
800694 not only did i get the color i wanted the seat i wanted i got the style i wanted and i would imagine that prices might go up
800695 theyre a physical team a big team but we played with a lot of energy it was a big win
800696 even though were so far away from the states it felt like we were playing at home
800697 o treinador fez um esquema muito bom e a gente n o cumpriu
800698 n o fizemos nada hoje praticamente s viajamos para s o paulo isso n o pode acontecer todo jogo fora acontece isso ent o melhor a gente n o jogar fora
800699 o treinador fez um esquema muito bom e a gente n o cumpriu
800700 o extra campo n o teve nada a ver isso n o atrapalha dentro de campo faltou vontade mesmo para a nossa equipe temos que assumir a nossa responsabilidade
800701 precisamos vencer fora at para recuperar a derrota para a portuguesa

800786 es normal que el envio por paquete azul tarde 5 dias habiles es el tiempo normal
800787 el articulo lo compre el dia 14 el pago fue mediante pay pal pago inmediato ya que lo tengo por tarjeta de credito segun el matasellos del sobre lo enviasteis el dia 22 8 dias despues y lo recibi el dia 24 el plazo de correos es normal con lo cual mis votos neutros con respecto a vosotros creo que estan fundados en los echos lo menos que podiais hacer es mirar porque se ha votado de forma neutral y no simplemente poner
800788 que injusto amigo mio como te dijimos en el mensaje que te enviamos a tu email personal tu paquete nos fue devuelto a los pocos dias con un golpe mayusculo por los de correos y como habian pasado 4 o 5 dias te dijimos que si lo querias anular y te dabamos tu dinero o preferias que te enviasemos otro paquete que nosotros corriamos con los gastos y ante la ausencia de tu respuesta procedimos a enviarlo de todas formas que tenga un buen dia
800789 a ver no me sean ustedes cinicos y por lo menos dignense a reconocer que tardan mas de la cuenta en enviar los paquetes eso de que me digeron ustedes que habia recibido un golpe el paquete en correos es una invencion para salir del paso y lastima que no hubiera sabido antes la clase de gente que son porque mi voto en logar de neutro con una descripcion buena habria sido negativo y recomendando no comprar en su tienda les vuelvo a repetir molestense en comprobar sus ventas no se limiten a enviar de mala manera los articulos ganados por sus compradores y si no saben como tratar a sus clientes les recomiendo que monten otro tipo de empresa atentamente un ex cliente descontento

800934 it is now as certain as anything can be in the course of american politics that governor dewey is elected and the nation knows it and yawns over the final three weeks of a campaign whose outcome was certain before it began

801004 even more telling ryan is not among the 110 poets included in the encyclopedic bay poetics anthology

801023 it was a grief and a bewilderment to feel her there so near to him and as far away from him as when first he had held her in his arms a warm enigma theat he would not read or strive to read if he had studied her and all her changes he might perhaps have seen there was no evil in her eyes that was not first his
801024 i am going to change the english language and the way people read poetry how to do it
801025 has it not be said of you that your life was your art and your art was fishing
801026 for the cover rather than the black with a dog collar aesthetic of an acker i think there are all kinds of questions here about how much of this is in minnis control
801027 a sense of shame some concept of all this being somehow dirty
801028 i also think that maliki recognizes that theyre going to need our help for some time to come as our commanders insist but that the help is of the sort that is consistent with the kind of phased withdrawal that i have promoted were going to have to provide them with logistical support intelligence support were going to have to have a very capable counterterrorism strike force were going to have to continue to train their army and police to make them more effective
801029 youve been talking about those limited missions for a long time having gone there and talked to both diplomatic and military folks do you have a clearer idea of how big a force youd need to leave behind to fulfill all those functions

801037 when we talk about pushing a tests limit of detection or lod were referring to the signal to noise ratio
801038 its really a matter of figuring out how to reduce the background noise and make the signal stand above the noise
801039 we identified a location that has the maximal signal to noise ratio
801040 by focusing on this signal rich point of light we extended the lod by two orders of magnitude
801041 about 90 percent of our time was spent in sample preparation not actually performing the assay
801042 with further integration and automation of the test the time could be reduced significantly
801043 the optical sensor requires a more expensive set up because of the confocal microscope
801044 so in a small dental or doctors office the electrochemical sensor generally would be easier and cheaper to use but to really push down the signal to noise ratio the optical sensor has the advantage
801045 but the technology is advancing so rapidly its difficult to predict how the optical sensor might be used in the years to come
801046 at this point it has certainly pushed the envelope for the limit of detection and this will be an important capability in advancing salivary diagnostics

801054 previous attempts to find better ways of encouraging skin cell growth have used chemical additives and other elaborate techniques to produce scaffolds but their success has been limited weve found that skin cells are actually very smart its in their dna to sort themselves into the right arrangement they just need a comparatively uncomplicated scaffold and each other to help them grow in a safe natural way
801055 ultimately we can envisage treatment of burns victims and the undertaking of reconstructive surgery using the scaffold and the patients own skin to produce bespoke skin for that patient

801057 in general our results show that mutations in the filaggrin gene are extremely strong risk factors for atopic dermatitis and beyond that for hay fever in the case of pre existing eczema they may also cause asthma
801058 we are now interested in finding out the precise consequences of filaggrin mutations
801059 the next thing to do is to examine the metabolic pathway of this important protein in addition we want to clarify which molecular mechanisms play a role at the genetic level but also concerning the protein itself then the final aim of course is to find a therapy for patients with atopic diseases
801060 if a lack of filaggrin is such an important factor in allergic diseases it would be almost conceivable to increase production of this protein or to replace its function in other ways

801184 dopo il federalismo bisogna passare anche alla riforma della scuola non possiamo pi lasciare martoriare i nostri figli da gente che non viene dal nord il problema della scuola molto sentito perch tocca tutte le famiglie la padania ormai nel cuore di tutti noi ai bambini la insegnamo fin da quando nascono insegnamo loro che non siamo schiavi e non lo siamo mai stati tutto quello che dico la verit un nostro ragazzo suo figlio renzo ndr stato bastonato agli esami perch aveva portato una tesina su carlo cattaneo
801185 dopo trentanni di scuola di sinistra di esami di sinistra di professori di sinistra di presidi di sinistra i nostri ragazzi sono disorientati i nostri studenti hanno bisogno di essere guidati da uno come umberto bossi
801186 nella nostra proposta di riforma della scuola abbiamo previsto lobbligatoriet
801187 bossi e la lega negli anni hanno dimostrato di avere a cuore il cambiamento e la modernizzazione del paese ma qualche volta come accaduto oggi le loro manifestazioni sconfinano
801188 spero che la reazione di italo bocchino allulteriore oltraggio e alle inqualificabili espressioni di bossi verso i simboli dellunit della repubblica apra una fase nuova da parte di tutto il centrodestra e dello stesso presidente del consiglio verso comportamenti assolutamente inaccettabili
801189 se davvero bossi ritenesse degno di insulto il sentimento didentit nazionale e di amore per la patria che alla base dellimpegno di tanti giovani in divisa che difendono la libert e la sicurezza nelle missioni internazionali allora non mi sentirei di stare a fianco suo e degli altri ministri della lega nord nel consiglio dei ministri con cui invece voglio continuare a vivere lo sforzo comune per rilanciare la nostra nazione
801190 bossi attacca gli insegnanti del sud ma senza di loro la scuola
801191 e evidente che lunit della nazione fuori discussione come anche la sacralit dellinno nazionale daltra parte bossi ci ha abituato ad espressioni e a gesti inusitati che sono funzionali al rapporto con la parte estrema del suo popolo questi atti non sono condivisibili va per considerato il nocciolo politico del suo discorso che quello di voler realizzare la riforma della giustizia ed il federalismo con la maggioranza e addirittura ricercando lintesa con lopposizione il resto fa parte di un gesto che va respinto ma che non muta il nostro giudizio positivo di fondo su bossi e sulla lega
801192 non possiamo far martoriare i nostri figli da gente non del nord
801193 dopo le impronte digitali ai bambini rom ora bossi vuole cacciare gli insegnati meridionali chiss se vale questo anche per la moglie manuela marrone siciliana di favara agrigento e per di pi insegnante e per i suoi tre figli rei di avere in parte sangue siciliano e dopo cosa far proporr le liste di proscrizione questo dubbio afferma cuffaro toglier il sonno agli italiani per le prossime settimane che si chiedono anche ma bossi la storia ditalia lavr mai letta lo sa che grazie ai meridionali se oggi lui e tutti i leghisti godono della libert di parola e di opinione lo sa bossi che se oggi la padania non un territorio austro ungarico grazie al sacrificio dei tanti patrioti e fra essi la maggior parte meridionali che dal piave a caporetto hanno sacrificato la propria vita per difendere i confini italiani i siciliani prosegue cuffaro a partire da ermocrate che nel 408 avanti cristo coni lo slogan n dori n joni ma siciliani oggi scimiottato dai leghisti sanno bene cosa sia lautonomia e il federalismo sono autonomisti e federalisti sin dalla notte dei tempi ma sono consapevoli anche del fatto che la grandezza di una nazione si misura dal grado di solidariet che essa sa esprimere
801194 essere del pdl non significa che bisogna tollerare quanto detto oggi da umberto bossi e da paola goisis

801212 this lyrical four part fugue is of unusual beauty its subject creeps from f sharp up to c sharp using a devious chromatic route before descending back to the tonic the countersubject is based on a sighing two note figure that gives the piece its sorrowful character the subject appears twice inverted in the alto in bar 20 and in the bass in bar 32 the climax is reached with the bass entry in bar 29 after which it calms down to the final reiteration that ends the piece

801256 big deal anyone can play another hendrix song to tell me it matches jimi hendrixs musical qualities
801257 its very rare i would say its somewhat of a fluke
801258 the only time its really a factor is when the ground is absolutely saturated in heavy clay soil on a slope where the soil may be destabilized thats extremely rare
801259 in this case it had nothing to do with that it was decay at the base of the tree it wasnt as though the whole tree shifted up or uprooted
801260 the staffer who is needed to prune a tree cant because hes dealing with a tree that has fallen over
801261 if we dont inspect the bridges that weve built eventually theyre going to fall its going to be a tragedy but we dont let that happen because we have engineers that go and inspect the bridges on a regular basis
801262 but with trees we dont have that level of rigour theres kind of just this thought that trees are ubiquitous and they just sort of live and they do their thing and thats that
801263 i figured if i show up on a reserve by car theyd probably think i was lost but if i arrive by bicycle with my helmet and jersey and sunglasses and loaded down with saddle bags on front and back it will break the ice and catch the kids attention
801264 it wasnt that long ago you lost your indian status in canada if you earned a university degree so a lot of aboriginals still resent that and think of post secondary education as a form of assimilation
801265 ill tell them hey just because you leave the reserve to get an education doesnt mean youll lose your identity
801266 you might even get skills you can bring back and use on the reserve
801267 for us as a big institution to do outreach on the reserves would be hard but josh is young hes cool and as an aboriginal hes keen to talk about his experiences we couldnt help but support his idea
801268 we need to be proactive to bring aboriginals into the professions including law because they face huge barriers and their representation is really quite stark
801269 in south australia theyve been working at this for some time
801270 as a result of dr mustards influence our state is even better positioned to provide the very best start for all south australians
801271 ensuring that our children develop to reach their potential as health and competent members of society is a priority
801272 you cant dump the whole responsibility for child development on families
801273 you have to build a system families can be a part of not controlled by the government but where the government sets standards
801274 its fair to say that these children are doing better than the average canadian child
801275 harsh truth is that school performance is already set by the time you enter the school system
801276 its very difficult and you can but its very difficult to change that what comes out of this is if you do not have good verbal skills by the age of 3 you probably will not do well in language and literacy in the school system
801277 there is a striking correlation between language and literacy and behaviour
801278 appear to have really high scores in those three domains
801279 in a way i would put more emphasis on the fact that those children are doing exceptionally well
801280 basically you are telling teachers and parents telling this community that there are many children who have at least one area of development where they are not doing as well as they should at age 5
801281 its a lot of good experiences in the first few years of life
801282 you start at an early age which is crucial and at the same time you have the health sector involved in such a way that they are involved in the development of children
801283 i felt that having a baby wasnt something that i wanted to be treated like a medical emergency
801284 it kind of redeemed the first experience i had a lot of hope for that ideal of having a baby at home i knew it could be a great experience
801285 i feel like every midwife i met at the practice was really compassionate and they really loved women and loved the care of women
801286 just the idea of birth being a family thing it can happen in the home its safe it can be a spiritual experience i felt like the midwives honoured that tradition
801287 women arent cookie cutters they have their babies at different rates and different ways
801288 midwifery gives that much more freedom to women to be able to have faith in their bodies and to be able to reclaim their own self
801289 at work no one has a midwife so everyone thought i was kind of crazy
801290 there were some kids around but apparently it fell without hurting anybody seriously
801291 were very fortunate it did fall in an area where kids do play there was a playground there its a very big tree and it could have killed people
801292 its a good sized tree that just fell apparently because it was old and rotten
801293 there was excessive decay caused by fungus it eats away at the tree
801294 in this case the decay was likely in the tree for a decade and slowly spread
801295 about four per cent of women were found to have type 2 diabetes within the first nine months and after that the rate was continually stable over the nine years
801296 probably the first nine months reflects women who had undiagnosed type 2 diabetes they probably had diabetes before the pregnancy and were not diagnosed
801297 so if you were pregnant in 1995 and had gestational diabetes your risk for developing type 2 diabetes was slower than if you were pregnant in 2005 and had gestational diabetes
801298 likely and they cant prove this from the data they have likely its because the population is heavier 10 years later
801299 commercial sites designed to sell product reinforce branding or advertise to youth
801300 only 19 of kids in grade 4 and 31 of kids in grade 11 critically question the presence of branded products in their virtual playgrounds
801301 the amount of advertising aimed at kids hurts the way they feel about themselves its harmful to them and it inhibits their happiness
801302 the target group is not only lesbian moms but also the men who donate sperm to them their children existing and ensuing as well as the other people who end up intentionally or not invested in the situation
801303 there are boundary issues brought up that have to be talked about
801304 is the donor okay with being a good friend but not dad are you okay with people in his family having access to your kid it can feel really scary trying to negotiate this risk to account for every possibility up front people get very worried but opening up doesnt have to be a bad thing
801305 what has always been important to me is that we be able to tell the truth about my daughters life i dont want to have to be less than honest just to make other people more comfortable
801306 some parent bloggers have a business motive some may be competitive some may believe they are just darn good bloggers and should be recognized for it some may not care at all
801307 mommy blogs are very popular but there are so many of them out there now that they are very hard to find
801308 by trying to establish themselves as the authority on mom blogs they are inviting mommy bloggers to compete for higher rankings this will mean more bloggers who want to rank well must produce more posts with more links and say things to generate more readers
801309 parenting is not the most ego gratifying job on the planet

801324 everyone jokes that there are already enough lawyers but in fact there is a severe shortage of lawyers skilled in aboriginal law and who practice in northern communities
801325 we see this law school as an important investment in the future of our people as it will encourage first nations youth to pursue careers that will enable our people to deal more effectively in business resource development
801326 we recognize that education is a key to our success
801327 our government has a pretty ambitious list of post secondary priorities more graduate studies 100 new medical spots for example but to be honest a new law school is not one of them
801328 we havent seen increased demand for law school and were looking at a study that shows a number of law students arent able to find articling jobs
801329 this is a major disappointment no question but were viewing it as a setback not a dismissal were not going to give up the ship
801330 we believe there is a need for a law school in northern ontario because weve seen the participation of northern students declining in law school partly because of the distance and cost
801331 we have to accept the governments decision but were disappointed because we do feel the proposal had merit particularly the idea of integrating the practical and theoretical all along the way

801346 draw near to godand he will draw near to you

801349 if a man will not work he shall not eat
801350 and you feel hes going to send you an already established flock of sheep that are giving enough in the offerings to support you and your family
801351 thats how weve done it before and thats how thousands of other pastors have done it before and thats how pastors and churches are doing this right now weve obviously got it wrong in the gospel according to mike
801352 let me encourage you to cease any response to this
801353 i just dont get how anyone can judge what anyone is doing in their life you dont see what sweetmummy and her family are doing day by day who they talk to how they talk to them the people they encourage the people they give wisdom to
801354 last year i never used to eat right now i eat healthy and work out a lot last season i played at 205 pounds and right now im 225 so i put on about 20 pounds hopefully it will help me through the long haul this season i thought i was a little small at 205 and i worked out a little bit toward the end of the year and i felt that if i put on some weight and muscle i could maybe last a little longer and be stronger towards the end of the season so thats pretty much my goal
801355 i think our wideouts are probably the most talented group we have on the team obviously mike jones and are our proven guys who made a lot of plays for us i think is going to have a really good year this year he has worked hard and hes good is another guy who has had a great summer and is going to really help us this year also our freshman is the guy who is the most ready to play he spent a lot of time with us in the off season and i think he will make a difference for us this year
801356 i think it will really help us out like i said we need to have all those guys in the field like those wideouts because theyre our best group we cant have them sitting on the bench and i think if we can just get the ball in my hands and get it to those guys fast and let them make plays that will be a key in our passing game and help from people blitzing us so much
801357 its hard to make a big play when youre going through short routes and you have to get it out im more worried about doing what is best for our team and helping the team out so if they have to get it out of my hand then that is what i am going to do
801358 to be honest i dont really know i do know we are ranked no 16 in the coaches poll and no 2 in the pac 10 but expectations are expectations i expect to have our team win as many games as we can all the expectations will take care of themselves at the end of the year i think we just have to be worried about taking one game at a time
801359 part of me loves it because it will be a great opportunity for us as a university and as a football team to show what we can do against some of the best teams in the country we are going to be in front of the national media which is going to get us out there even more than last year if we can do well then again its pretty rough because we have georgia cal usc and oregon all in row and two of those four are on the road so that can be a pretty difficult stretch if you dont take care of things because we could be hurting by that time of year
801360 its unbelievable thomas is really a huge asset to our team because we can put points on the board from all over the field he really helped us out last year because we had trouble scoring sometimes so it is great having a good kicker and it is great having faith in a kicker
801361 i think they will help hopefully well find out when we start practice tomorrow as soon as we start playing against our defense well see if it is going to help us out but i think if we can run those new things we put in effectively it will slow down some teams from really blitzing us like they did last year
801362 i think it will be better because we have all of our facilities here technology for film our weight room and our training facilities for when guys get hurt we dont have all that stuff up there so i think it makes it a lot easier being here and its more convenient guys get more rest and sleep better without all the traveling it will at least help make guys more enthusiastic during camp when it starts to get hard and well be better because of that
801363 i think we just know what to expect from the coaching staff we know how they are how they run practices and do everything on and off the field they also know how we are we all have a better feel for how things go and obviously its much different than from when coach koetter was here and were all adjusted to that weve adjusted to the new teams on offense and defense and i think the second year will be better than the first year
801364 it means a lot to me actually because its rare that people start a lot of consecutive games for a couple reasons people always want somebody else and on top of that injuries can happen so im thankful and im grateful that i have had the opportunity to play a lot of games and i have been healthy to do that i also know that experience usually helps a lot throughout the course of the season especially at my position
801365 the less you blitz the better off you are youre a little more sound across the board if our front four can get pressure and we can sit seven deep then thats going to be great for our pass defense its when teams keep six or seven in thats where we can get creative and find new ways to get pressure were going to put a couple of blitzes in were definitely going to blitz and if were having trouble getting pressure then were going to create a little more hopefully our front four especially with our ends will be able to minimize that as much as possible
801366 spring helped quite a bit did a lot of the blitzing for us last year and we need somebody to step up and fill that whole be able to get pressure and create movement in the pocket if we cant find that in the fall then were just going to have to find another way to get pressure
801367 a couple of the young guys with they really have that burst that robert had they just got to be a little more consistent throughout fall camp and they will be able to help us out a lot come fall
801368 so far over summer he is making all the times jon is fast and he should help us but he has a lot of things he needs to work on like being disciplined and taking it all in hes also still young too but he should help us a lot
801369 usually you know before the play if youre going to be doubled team or not just by playing a shade or a 3 its tough but at times you have to make a play and youll find a way to do it hopefully i can make some this year
801370 most of it is experience with the speed of the game when you got a 12 play drive compared to a 3 play drive its a lot different and it got me ready for my senior year i just cant wait and those long plays wont even hurt me with the experience
801371 plazes is a location aware service connecting you with the people and places in your vicinity and all over the world
801372 this is always an exciting time for everybody in college football everybody is undefeated you get a chance to talk about whats going to happen in the future its a fun time for me its as fun as there is theres nothing like college football the anticipation what tv game is on whos going to win the national championship whos going to go to the rose bowl and all those different things thats what makes it such a great sport this is a great time were excited about our football team weve got a lot of returners back in a lot of different areas and weve got a lot of areas where weve got to have people step up and where were going to be very young i dont know that its unlike any year that youre going to have youre going to have people coming back and experience and youre going to have inexperience to me its a matter of how you come together what happens during two a days what happens in the fall injuries who steps up and all those different things we had a very good summer from what i understand as far as the offseason workouts thats how it is anymore its an all around every month everyday job anymore there is no time off our guys spent a lot of time here with our strength coach and did a lot of things on their own hopefully it pays off for them
801373 well continue to close that gap weve had good players here as ive said many times coach dirk koetter did an outstanding job recruiting here were continuing to do that were going to be very young at some positions our recruiting class that we got a year ago were going to have a lot of those guys playing particularly in the offensive line this class coming in its good on paper theyre all good on paper but well find out tomorrow exactly where theyre at we feel very good about some of those young guys we really think that they can help us this year but that remains to be seen where were at right now we wont know until we start you dont know how good you are until you start playing a lot of times it takes three or four games to even find out where youre at sometimes it takes longer than that
801374 having an experienced quarterback is huge theres no question about it quarterback is a very key position is it the total answer obviously its not the total answer but its nice to have a guy like rudy carpenter coming back whos played as many games as hes played theres nothing like playing you can have a guy thats very talented and there are a lot of them in our league and a lot of new ones in our league that are going to be playing but theres nothing like having that experience on the football field with rudy coming back i feel very good about that aspect of it not only has he played a lot hes been very successful hes a guy were depending on hes been a real leader for us since hes been here hes been a real leader this summer for us as far as organizing the things that needed to get done were very fortunate
801375 i certainly hope so i expect him being in our offense for a year and understanding what we want were adding some things too that will really help him in my opinion were a little different team offensively just because of our personnel than we were a year ago just the experience of the rush getting the football off on time when people are in your face getting hit in the mouth which he did a number of times all that really makes a big difference
801376 i dont know if its an advantage or a disadvantage we made a decision a year ago that we were going to get a new facility here it has nothing to do with tontozona at all its about our indoor facility we really feel that well have one of the best indoor facilities in the country it wasnt just about that it was about being to work in there in the summer time being able to work in there in the winter being able to work in there in the heat not just during training camp but during the season when we need to that is such a plus when you look inside of it and go inside of it weve got so much room more than any of the places ive been as far as practice facilities are concerned its going to be a huge advantage for us so in saying that there was no reason for us to go up there because of weather theres an advantage to staying at home as far as facilities film work our own weight room and all those different things tontozona has been great for this program over the years and it was great for us last year it doesnt have to anything to do with wanting to go up there or not its just our new facility
801377 no i dont believe we have i try to put those memories behind me if we have thats tough you look at our schedule we play northern arizona on aug 30 michigan appalachian state coach jerome souers has done a great job up there and theyve got a great opportunity to come down here ive been on both ends of that stanford to me is huge thats our first league game at home you can go on and on its a tough stretch theres no question about it the thing about schedules is and ive grown to live with this the last four or five months the schedule is the schedule and you go play it you play them when theyre there and just go play them
801378 i knew theyd be on top and i knew wed play them both you knew what it was going to be like those are two great programs and we just happened to play both of them we happen to play both of them again next year so thats just how it is
801379 weve got to establish our offensive front theres no question about that were going to be young in talking about that who was at right tackle for us last year will not play this year he decided not to play football so adam tello will be our starter im excited about our offensive front but it is an area thats young weve got shawn lauvao and paul fanaika coming back theyre the two experienced guys and everybody else is going to be new theyre athletic and it will be exciting to see how they come about thats a real big question so well see what happens but thats probably the biggest one weve got right now
801380 were going to be involved in some different things as far as what were doing offensively ive been in a lot of offenses in my coaching career and spread it out before people were spreading it out so were going to do some of that get it off quick and try to give him a little bit better opportunities when youre in three and five step drops you get it off a little quicker hell get rid of it the offense will be conducive to him getting rid of it
801381 a lot of it depends on what our depth is there will be some that will play in my mind there will probably be four or five of them but who they are im not sure we need some help in the defensive front to develop some depth so thats a possibility same thing in the secondary at corner and or safety at wide receiver probably has a chance to compete and play its a good class well see where theyre at but i wouldnt be surprised to see four or five of those true freshmen play
801382 weve got a lot of starters back so were about the same as we were a year ago i think were a little bit faster weve got some young guys that will play and continue to improve our speed we will continue to improve our speed all the time thats what we believe in defensively to play fast and play very aggressive our defensive philosophy is based on guys that can run so our defense every year will continue to get faster we will continue to keep it simple like we have we really believe that if you dont have to think you play faster thats what we were able to do last year now well add some different things maybe bring a little bit more pressure because were a little bit more experienced but speed is the key on defense for us
801383 our skill areas offensively at running back and wide receiver is a strength for us any time you have keegan herring coming back and kyle williams mike jones at receiver so we do have some skill and then you throw rudy carpenter in there thats an area that i like our experience at safety with mike nixon travis goethel gerald munns so we do have some experience and i dont know that there is anybody thats got a pair of defensive ends like luis vasquez and that we have right now weve got to find a third one but theyre pretty good

801676 cheguei perto do alvo posicionando me a cerca de seis milhas de dist ncia dele o que ainda longe para que possa haver uma verifica o precisa ainda mais noite o alvo parou de se deslocar na minha dire o e come ou a subir eu n o perdi o contato radar inicial e passei a subir junto com ele continuei seguindo o contato at cerca de 30 mil p s quando perdi o contato radar e fiquei apenas com o visual mas naquele momento aquela luz forte j se confundia muito com as luzes das estrelas
801677 como piloto de alerta naquele dia fui contatado pelo oficial de perman ncia na vila dos oficiais local onde morava a informa o passada era a de que o piloto de alerta havia sido acionado e ent o por doutrina e treinamento eu me dirigi diretamente para o avi o e s depois da decolagem que recebi as espec ficas instru es necess rias minha miss o o piloto de alerta n o precisa passar pela burocracia de um v o normal o avi o j est preparado para a decolagem
801678 eu n o estava escalado de alerta tinha ficado em santa cruz para estudar para uma prova de ensaio em v o quando o alerta foi acionado pensei que era treinamento e continuei estudando at que o soldado de servi o veio com a informa o de que estavam precisando de outro piloto para voar ele s disse que havia alguma situa o de detec o de contatos desconhecidos e que at o avi o reabastecedor deveria ser acionado
801679 no caso quem n o estava preparado era eu o piloto mas eu que estava no esquadr o e ent o fui o kleber foi o primeiro para a gente era um treinamento normal mas com a evolu o da situa o outro f 5 foi acionado
801680 a decolagem foi normal fiquei em torno de 20 mil p s na dire o de s o jos dos campos por orienta o da defesa a rea desliguei todos os equipamentos de bordo radar luzes de navega o fiquei apenas com o r dio de comunica o ligado
801681 como os alvos n o possu am equipamento algum que transmitisse qualquer onda eletromagn tica n o era poss vel saber a altura em que voavam toda a orienta o que me foi dada era para que eu fizesse procuras visuais de acordo com os radares de bras lia eu deveria olhar para as minhas 2 horas e 11 horas alto e baixo mas eu n o via nada
801682 eu estava bem em cima da f brica da embraer e nada havia avistado at ent o em fun o destes alvos aglomerados na minha esquerda o controlador pediu que eu fizesse uma curva pela direita e voltasse em dire o a santa cruz com 180 graus defasados
801683 eu efetuei a curva estabilizei a aeronave na proa que ele havia recomendado e como pedido comecei a fazer uma varredura visual foi neste momento que eu avistei uma luz muito forte que se real ava em rela o a todas as luzes no litoral estava um pouco mais baixa do que eu a impress o n tida que eu tive naquele momento era de que ela se deslocava da direita para a esquerda
801684 olhei para aquela luz o seu movimento era muito evidente para mim perguntei defesa a rea se existia algum tr fego naquele setor no momento devido proximidade com a rota da ponte a rea na poca fui informado que n o n o existia aeronave alguma no local naquela hora informei ent o ao controlador que eu realmente estava vendo a luz se deslocando na minha rota de intercepta o s 2 horas minha direita um pouco mais baixo do que a posi o da minha aeronave foi naquele momento que eu pude ter uma no o da altura do contato algo em torno de 17 mil p s imediatamente recebi a instru o de aproar aquele alvo e prosseguir com a aproxima o e sua poss vel identifica o
801685 n o havia muito tempo para pensar nem para sentir medo a adrenalina que funciona na hora voc tem o avi o para voar est em um v o noturno supers nico sujeito desorienta o espacial eu confesso que n o tenho recorda es exatas dos meus sentimentos naquele momento a nica coisa que eu sabia que tinha que ir para cima do alvo e medida que as coisas v o acontecendo e devido ao nosso treinamento as rea es passam a ser um pouco autom ticas
801686 comecei a descer indo diretamente para o alvo mas tomando todo o cuidado com uma poss vel ilus o de tica proporcionada pela vis o noturna
801687 cheguei perto do alvo posicionando me a cerca de seis milhas de dist ncia dele o que ainda longe para que possa haver uma verifica o precisa ainda mais noite o alvo parou de se deslocar na minha dire o e come ou a subir eu n o perdi o contato radar inicial e passei a subir junto com ele continuei seguindo o contato at cerca de 30 mil p s quando perdi o contato radar e fiquei apenas com o visual mas naquele momento aquela luz forte j se confundia muito com as luzes das estrelas
801688 os meus r dios de navega o selecionados em santa cruz j estavam fora de alcance em determinado momento as agulhas do meu adf deixaram de ficar sem rumo e indicaram a proa a minha janela do dme que estava com a flag indicou 30 milhas fixas sem qualquer raz o para isso o combust vel j estava chegando no limite devido ao grande consumo das velocidades supers nicas e eu tive que voltar menos de um minuto depois que aproei em santa cruz novamente meu adf voltou a ficar sem qualquer informa o e a janela do meu instrumento dme fechou de novo deixando de aparecer
801689 ao chegar eu me dirigi juntamente com os demais membros da equipe de alerta imediatamente para os hangares onde estavam posicionadas duas aeronaves f 103e a equipe de manuten o j havia completado o seu trabalho e nos esperava ao p da escada com as aeronaves prontas e armadas para a decolagem completei os cheques previstos para antes da partida e entrei em contato com o oficial de perman ncia operacional opo para informar que estava pronto de imediato recebi ordem para acionar o motor e decolar isolado meu ala permaneceu no solo
801690 em seguida fiz contato com an polis que me passou de imediato para a freq ncia do copm que controlaria a intercepta o a primeira informa o que recebi foi de que meu alvo se encontrava a uma dist ncia de 100 milhas da posi o em que eu estava pude perceber que o tempo estava bom n o havia nuvens e nem a lua aparecia o c u completamente estrelado fazia um belo contraponto com a escurid o da noite
801691 medida que a dist ncia diminu a como n o conseguia contato em meu radar de bordo passei simultaneamente a realizar uma busca visual no espa o a reo em torno da posi o informada pelo copm s que mais uma vez nada apareceu
801692 ainda estava nesse procedimento sem sucesso quando recebi a informa o do controlador de que meu alvo havia mudado deposi o e agora estava em outra dire o a 50 milhas de dist ncia fui ent o orientado para essa nova intercepta o
801693 sem sucesso nesse procedimento fui novamente informado de outra altera o no posicionamento do alvo e recebi novas orienta es para uma terceira intercepta o mais uma vez n o houve qualquer contato radar ou visual fui orientado a baixar ainda mais o n vel de v o permanecendo em rbita sobre o ponto determinado e continuando a procura depois de algum tempo nessa busca e tendo em vista que minha autonomia de v o j havia atingido o n vel suficiente apenas para permitir o meu retorno seguro para o aer dromo recebi instru es para o regresso
801694 ap s o pouso fiz um contato telef nico com o meu controlador para o debriefing rotineiro da miss o s assim tomei conhecimento dos outros f 103 que haviam sido acionados eles decolaram depois de mim para a averigua o de diversos contatos radar plotados nas telas do cindacta em pontos diferentes da regi o centro oeste ao terminar os procedimentos p s v o de praxe fui liberado e autorizado a retornar para minha resid ncia onde cheguei por volta de 1h30m uma hora mais tarde fui acordado por um novo acionamento do bip era outro alerta ao chegar base e entrar novamente em contato com o opo a orienta o desta vez era para que o alerta fosse mantido a postos e as aeronaves prontas para a decolagem o meu ala e eu ficamos assim por cerca de 45 minutos quase s 4h recebemos a informa o de que o alerta estava suspenso e n s liberados
801695 uma coisa que chamou a minha aten o naquela noite foi a claridade do c u eu nunca havia visto uma noite t o clara sabe aquela noite que voc anda de carro com a luz apagada e consegue ver tudo dava para ver o vale do para ba at s o paulo n o havia nebulosidade era poss vel ver o contorno das montanhas no ch o uma visibilidade sob a qual poucas vezes eu voei indo em dire o a s o jos dos campos fui instru do por bras lia a fazer o cheque de armamento foi a que me informaram que havia cerca de cinco contatos na minha frente e a umas 15 milhas de dist ncia eu n o via nada no radar do avi o e nem do lado de fora mas a informa o era de que eles estavam se aproximando cada vez mais dez milhas cinco milhas tr s milhas e eu pensando que n o era poss vel em uma noite daquelas eu n o estar enxergando o tal contato
801696 agora est o atr s de voc te acompanhando como se estivessem na sua ala
801697 tive autoriza o para fazer um 180 e continuei sem ver coisa alguma fui pra s o jos dos campos voando a cerca de 15 mil p s e comecei a fazer rbitas chamei o kl ber na freq ncia t tica para saber se ele tinha avistado alguma coisa ele disse que sim mas que quando tentou ir atr s o contato sumiu quando eu estava em cima de s o jos dos campos olhei em dire o ilha bela e pela primeira vez vi uma luz vermelha parada para mim estava no n vel do horizonte mas eu estava olhando para o oceano o que me fez acreditar que podia ser um barco muito longe ou algum outro tipo de ilumina o era como luz de alto de edif cio ficou parada n o mudou de cor n o piscou e nem se mexeu eu avisei ao controle que estava vendo uma luz na proa 90 graus em dire o ao oceano como confirmava com o contato no radar de terra fui instru do a ir em sua dire o entrei supers nico para acelerar e a luz nem se mexia fui informado de que ela estaria andando na mesma velocidade que eu fui mantendo esta navega o at dar o meu combust vel m nimo e tive que voltar para mim que decolei com uma expectativa dada por bras lia foi a maior frustra o da minha vida a luz que vi podia ser um barco no horizonte ou quem sabe ser mesmo alguma outra coisa mas leviano chegar a qualquer conclus o
801698 era um dia normal no primeiro grupo de defesa a rea at a hora em que o meu bip tocou de madrugada o alerta havia sido acionado eu estava dormindo e levantei sem nem saber que horas eram faz parte da rotina eu me vesti e no caminho da base fiquei me questionando se aquilo seria apenas mais um teste eu esperava voar afinal n o h nada mais chato do que ir para o hangar do alerta abastecer e ser dispensado toda miss o da defesa a rea real at ser cancelada ent o vesti o traje anti g o colete e o mec nico confirmou a aeronave pronta o armamento tamb m estava certo e municiado haviam se passado 22 minutos desde que o alerta tinha sido dado preparei me para decolar imaginando o que estaria acontecendo pela proximidade com bras lia imaginei que estivesse atr s de algum v o comercial mas se fosse eu teria avistado as luzes anticolis o fui seguindo todos os comandos do controlador a noite estava linda com a visibilidade ilimitada era poss vel ver tudo l embaixo desde as cidades at os far is dos carros
801699 fui instru do a elevar a minha altura verifiquei mais uma vez o radar de bordo e desci um pouco a varredura da antena continuei acompanhando o radar de bordo e buscando algo no visual a nossa dist ncia informada pelo controlador era de apenas tr s milhas e eu continuava sem enxergar nada imaginei que eram os f 5 do grupo de ca a vindo atacar a base em miss o de treinamento pedi para o controlador me aproximar ainda mais at confundir os plotes com minha chegada vindo por tr s achei que o contato iria finalmente acender as luzes afinal eles deveriam estar ouvindo a intercepta o pelos canais da defesa a rea o controle anunciou uma milha na proa mas eu n o tinha nada no radar e nem no visual 0 meu v o durou cerca de 30 minutos e depois das tentativas de busca regressei base sem fazer qualquer tipo de contato
801700 quando cruz vamos cerca de 12 mil p s o cindacta nos chamou no r dio e pediu para que confirm ssemos se v amos algum tr fego na posi o de 11 horas normal que isto ocorra mas estranho foi quando ap s respondermos negativamente ele ter dito
801701 olhamos um para o outro imaginando que n o hav amos entendido direito o que viera pelo r dio e pedimos para que a informa o fosse repetida
801702 n s n o t nhamos no o da altura do tr fego pois os radares dos avi es comerciais s o meteorol gicos e diferente dos ca as t m muita dificuldade de captar outra aeronave eles n o s o feitos para isso o controlador tamb m n o podia saber a altura do objeto j que sem transponder tudo o que ele v a dimens o nica do radar sem diferen a de altitude o objeto estava pr ximo de santa cruz e a nossa dist ncia era em tomo das 90 milhas o que eu posso dizer que ele estava visualmente a uns 20 graus mais alto do que n s atingimos nossa altitude de cruzeiro de 23 mil p s e durante todo o v o o controlador foi nos informando sobre a aproxima o passou para 60 milhas depois 50 o tempo todo na nossa proa
801703 ramos quatro tripulantes no cockpit escuro de um avi o cargueiro buscando os c us vidos de encontrar uma explica o sobre aquilo que tanto se aproximava do nosso 707 de repente eu olhei para o nivaldo e reparei na express o dele como se ele quisesse me mostrar alguma coisa ele disse que algo tinha se deslocado deixando um rastro luminoso mas poderia ser um meteorito o que seria muito comum o controlador nos avisou ent o que o alvo havia se deslocado em alta velocidade para a nossa direita atingindo em fra o de segundos uma velocidade incr vel algo acima de mach 5 um ser humano n o ag entaria uma acelera o dessas ele morreria com tal deslocamento
801704 n s est vamos a umas 30 milhas dele a impress o que dava era de que o contato estava se deslocando em baixa velocidade e n s que est vamos nos aproximando dele a aproxima o continuou o radar ia nos avisando as dist ncias quinze milhas dez cinco na melhor das hip teses entrar amos para a hist ria
801705 mas eu olhava olhava e n o via mais nada a o controlador falou tr s milhas duas uma varig o tr fego est se fundindo com o plote do seu avi o n s olh vamos para cima para baixo e n o v amos nada o controle nos informou ent o que o alvo estava passando para tr s da aeronave mas come ou a ter muita interfer ncia no solo e o radar o perdeu de vista
801706 h muitas hip teses pode ter sido um fen meno eletromagn tico uma interfer ncia qualquer mas a situa o continua indefinida s acho importante lembrar que
801707 j o piloto sim ainda mais noite est sujeito a ter ilus es de tica fant sticas voando em cima da gua por exemplo voc v o c u l embaixo por isso tem que voar por instrumentos h casos de pessoas que viram coisas estranhas mas a maioria das hist rias mesmo fantasiosa ent o uma autoridade tem que ter muito cuidado para nao tornar cr tica uma situa o que j alarmante quando algu m se depara com um contato informa ao tr fego a reo que vai reportar aos centros integrados situados em curitiba pr em bras lia em recife pe e na amaz nia estes centros est o em permanente comunica o tudo automatizado fui informado logo de imediato quando ocorre uma situa o dessas o comando geral do ar logo d ci ncia ao ministro e a partir dai que os procedimentos de intercepta o s o disparados e foi assim que ocorreu os ca as levantaram v o apenas com ordem de verifica o em nenhum momento foi mantida uma postura agressiva como poder amos atirar em algo que desconhec amos as luzes foram plotadas no radar e t nhamos que tentar identific las n o existe aquela preocupa o de decolar com m sseis como nos filmes os avi es de perman ncia geralmente est o armados eles ficam 24 horas com os pilotos do lado prontos para serem acionados em minutos mas a principio sem ordem de disparo
801708 no dia seguinte vi as manchetes nas televis es e nas r dios anunciando v rias intercepta es de ovnis ocorridas tia noite anterior e justo eu um apaixonado pelo assunto n o vi nada mas cheguei perto acho que em um universo infinito destes com diversas possibilidades n o tem por que estarmos sozinhos
801709 muitas vezes me perguntam se eu acredito ou n o na presen a de objetos voadores n o identificados naquela noite
801710 eu n o acredito e nem desacredito pois assim como o universo isto algo al m da nossa compreens o
801711 eu tive contato visual e contato eletr nico era algo s lido dizem que naquele lugar h muita anomalia magn tica mas eu n o acredito que seja isso as anomalias t m movimentos irregulares aleat rios no meu relat rio eu pedi que fosse averiguado se havia algum porta avi es pr ximo costa ou alguma aeronave que poderia estar sobre o nosso espa o a reo efetuando contramedidas eletr nicas o que permitira colocar um plote nos radares nada do que eu presumi foi confirmado a partir da afirmar que acredito em ovnis ou que aquilo era de fato um ovni j outra coisa cada um vai tecer a sua opini o acho que esse universo muito grande para que s n s existamos nele seria muito ego smo da nossa parte acreditar nisso mas a verdade que ficamos sobre uma linha muito t nue era a posi o que eu tinha na poca o avi o que eu estava voando e todas as minhas cren as ent o eu prefiro me referir apenas parte t cnica
801712 s n o podemos afirmar o que era mas mediante a coincid ncia de detec es radares distintas e simultaneamente a detec o radar das aeronaves n o podemos negar a exist ncia de algo acontece que n s n o t nhamos meios t cnicos para verificar visualmente como eram esses alvos apesar do contato visual que os pilotos fizeram como explicar por exemplo os instrumentos de bordo dos f 5 que ficaram prejudicados durante o ocorrido o r dio por m n o sofreu nada e a comunica o p de ser mantida o tempo todo havia inclusive as fitas com as conversas entre controladores e pilotos elas foram exaustivamente analisadas foi feito tamb m um relato na poca mas n o posso afirmar onde as fitas se encontram agora provavelmente nem existam mais quando eu deixei o cargo de chefe do coda as investiga es j tinham sido encerradas analisando como t cnico da defesa a rea pois esta era a fun o que eu desempenhava posso dizer que n s s lidamos com a realidade desde que tudo aconteceu eu sempre confirmei a presen a dos alvos se tirarmos a conclus o de an lise t cnica mesmo depois de avaliar a fita do radar de bras lia santa cruz e pico do couto em petr polis poss vel verificar que realmente ocorreu uma coisa estranha durante um tempo o objeto ficava parado no espa o depois desenvolvia velocidades acima de mach 3 as varia es eram algumas vezes instant neas outras gradativas os alvos circundavam as aeronaves e mudavam de dire o em rela o a elas estes movimentos n o permitiram maior aproxima o tudo o que foi avistado eram luzes com varia es intensas eu poderia at dizer que de alguma forma eles queriam sim ser vistos ent o ainda fica a inc gnita que existiu existiu o qu eu n o posso afirmar mas s o acontecimentos que marcam a mente das pessoas porque s o fatos muito incomuns eu com certeza n o vou me esquecer nunca daquele 19 de maio
801713 a maioria das pessoas nem sabe que s 3h ainda tinha um objeto l em cima na verdade muita gente nem gosta de falar sobre isso mas foi uma coisa que eu vi sinceramente acho um privil gio
801714 eu mesmo j cansei de ver v nus aparecendo de forma estranha e muita gente acha que um ovni o avi o vai passando por densidades diferentes do ar o que causa efeitos de refra o e as coisas parecem estar se mexendo ou mudando de forma dessa vez por m houve a confirma o no sistema de radar o que nos prova que n o era uma ilus o podia ser um avi o no in cio achei que sim poderia ser um contrabandista um avi o de espionagem eu n o sei
801715 na poca houve v rias entrevistas com pessoas de v rios segmentos cada um tentando explicar de acordo com seu campo de conhecimento geralmente atribuindo a fen menos f sicos qu micos ou de mbito espiritual mesmo assim eu n o me conven o e aquela acelera o a localiza o precisa na proa o contato radar a coincid ncia de tornar se vis vel ao contato r dio inicial n o encaixa era alguma coisa realmente fora do nosso entendimento podia ser de outro planeta daqui da terra mesmo enfim me resta apenas concluir que era um objeto voador n o identificado um ovni

801747 this is the first observation that really pins down that titan has a surface lake filled with liquid
801748 detection of liquid ethane confirms a long held idea that lakes and seas filled with methane and ethane exist on titan
801749 the fact we could detect the ethane spectral signatures of the lake even when it was so dimly illuminated and at a slanted viewing path through titans atmosphere raises expectations for exciting future lake discoveries by our instrument

801775 although i was hadnt won i was confident i was going to win
801776 i told everybody that knows me that its just a matter of time its going to come this was a six week run and i was geared up to win im glad that it happened the first week out
801777 it wasnt a good finish for me but i played really well today

801789 it seems to me the only thing obama wants us to do is inflate tires
801790 barack obama stood up at a speech recently and said that one of the things that is really important from energy policy from his standpoint is to check the pressure in our tires so heres a tire gauge and you can go out in the parking lot here and check your tires now thats an interesting thing we want you to have good pressure in your tires you know it will very mildly add to your fuel efficiency but checking the air pressure in your tires is not an energy policy for the united states of america
801791 the entirety of obamas position is making sure our tires are inflated

801891 moderating comments opens newspapers up to legal problems that blogs dont have to worry about we will get sued

801967 janet fraiser i am here to offer you a gift come let us leave this place
801968 yes to you we are ascended to us this is our life
801969 no i took a familiar scene to make the transition easier
801970 no everyone experiences this differently oma took him further more quickly
801971 one of your more recent television shows i presume but you are not dead nor are you quite like me
801972 your people knew me as morgan le fay i am ganos lal i am an alteran specifically i am a lantian one of what your people call the ancients
801973 ganos morgan youre one of the ancients like ayiana or oma de sala
801974 yes and like oma myself and others feel it is important to assist those worthy of ascension
801975 my appearance is not what you expected is it janet
801976 to a point yes but that is only because this is all so new to you
801977 not exactly with my assistance you have taken the first step but you have a choice just as your friend daniel had however he had time to consider it before his body was lost in your case i intercepted you after your body failed but before your spirit left
801978 to make you the same offer as we made to daniel you can be one with us for near eternity if you wish
801979 your spirit will continue its journey to whatever lies beyond this plane
801980 so youre not an angel this isnt heaven or purgatory or
801981 no this is a mental construct of mine based on a loose association with the afterlife from your mind we exist outside the boundaries of the four dimensions time and space are not impediments to us but this is not beyond life
801982 we do not know one of us tried to find out eons ago as your people consider time and was never heard from again did he go on to a higher existence or did he simply cease to be we do not know
801983 so you dont know what never mind i believe there is more to life than even this i believe there is a soul that journeys on after death
801984 well that is the choice you have now you can see if you are correct in your faith or you can stay with us and learn the secrets of existence
801985 secrets i dont care about any secrets the only secret i care about is how i get my life back i want to see my daughter tell her i love her tell sam
801986 please be at peace janet you can see them you can see how they will grow and progress and if the fates are kind you can be with them again at the end of their mortal lives
801987 not necessarily samantha carter and her friends have accomplished much in a short time enough to be worthy of consideration for ascension cassandra fraiser is an uncommon woman and is destined for greatness this destiny could bring her into consideration as well
801988 in sams case i saw how tortured she was when she was forced to leave cassandra in that old bunker and when she disobeyed orders to be with that terrified little girl i knew why you and she were together
801989 and you threatened a system lord you are both scientists but also warriors defending your world your people and you are willing to try and work around the often easier more violent solution to look at other alternatives
801990 true warriors do not seek combat they do not desire it but they are prepared should force be required
801991 i cannot foretell what will happen but we can read portents she has the potential for greatness if she fulfills that potential she would be offered ascension
801992 then if your belief is true you will see them at the end of this existence
801993 i believe we are more than the sum of our lives how much more no one can really say
801994 of course at saint louis u you were my roommate my sophomore year you were taking philosophy and we had long long discussions at least once a week ever since we saw that one outer limits show
801995 my time on your plane was finished i had i have duties in one of our ancient cities
801996 yes this is my real appearance or rather it was when i ascended
801997 i think i fell in love with you and whenever you kissed me it was so wonderful our lives were then you didnt come back after the summer break and i felt
801998 i tried to find you you know i called the town you claimed to be from and no one knew anyone named da vinci there i even went there one weekend and
801999 i never really forgot you even when sam and i
802000 damn you damn you helen or morgan or whatever the fuck i should call you
802001 i am sorry janet i wanted to be with you from the beginning but
802002 but youre ascended you know these things you probably knew before i did that i wanted you
802003 i did but as you said you didnt i wouldnt force that on anyone least of all someone i care for
802004 janet when we take mortal form again we are severely limited in what we can do and to be honest the temptation to use our abilities while mortal is too great
802005 when we live as mortals we are prone to mortal weaknesses and desires fortunately we retain enough of our self awareness to avoid creating problems when we are there to help
802006 i never took advantage of you what we did we both wanted but i was also there to correct a situation i was there to help you
802007 you didnt know what you wanted to do you were just in college to get out of that small shit box i believe you called it small shit box town near the fort where the army had transferred your father
802008 and a photographer a reporter an explorer a housewife a corporate executive a senator need i go on
802009 no but i always wanted to be a doctor where did you
802010 you had lost interest in medicine you really didnt have much interest in anything when i met you
802011 so youre saying i was destined to be a doctor
802012 yes and a special one you have always put yourself second to any charge even a mortal enemy like anubis in our eyes that alone would have made you worthy of ascension
802013 there really was nothing to say to ease the pain for both of us
802014 so you saw my whole post helen life of denial a bad marriage failed relationships and
802015 and your finding your one true love and happiness a family of your own the trials you experienced made you ready for what came later it hurt me to see you go through that but i knew it was necessary as for what we had
802016 it wasnt real none of it you werent you arent helen
802017 except for my name i never lied to you i was helen i am helen the name was only an alias the persona was me and it still is
802018 did you after when i joined the sgc did you
802019 i did nothing you and samantha were together of your own choosing and unhappy circumstances brought cassandra in your lives
802020 yes and no i wished it could be me but i know you were happy and that made me happy
802021 im sorry even with the pain your leaving caused id never wish you any pain
802022 you and sam were having a passionate moment after one of missions her team had been gone for quite a long time and were possibly lost your relief at finding sam was safe
802023 i remember after the second encounter with that with hathor
802024 after the physicals you had dragged sam into your office but the door wasnt locked jack oneill opened the door and saw you pleasuring sam
802025 sam i need to do a more thorough exam please take off your pants
802026 he was most interested and you both were too far gone to realize he was even there
802027 i arranged for him to go back to the command center convinced he saw nothing
802028 i will only say that jack oneill has some vivid fantasies now
802029 this is like that time with the junior executive the young republican guy who always wore a suit
802030 yeah that certainly got mr keatons attention i dont think well have any more trouble with him
802031 no uh i mean uh no not unless you uh want to
802032 i think we should take this a little slow okay
802033 good i dont want you to feel i wont put any pressure on you if you want more janet its up to you to let me know
802034 i know but this feels so right im scared and im excited and im
802035 that was a magical night the perfect end to a magical week
802036 i mean you are magic at least as far as
802037 yes for me too janet even among us there are soul mates in my case a corporeal was mine is mine
802038 you mean for all those millennia there was no one
802039 well there was moros youd know him better as myrddin or merlin
802040 yep i was his companion when he first returned to earth after our ascension i was tasked with watching him and making sure he didnt interfere in the corporeal world beyond our mandate at least that part of my legend some of you got right
802041 morgan le fay i remember why that name was so familiar
802042 and you never even cracked a smile when we rented excalibur
802043 well it was a visually stunning well made movie even if it was almost all wrong
802044 there are other races than the goauld who pose a threat to earth and you know some of them
802045 sure the retoo those lizard men who were the first hosts they can be dangerous those lightning bug things on that gas giant moon the replicators and i know theres some others but im drawing a blank
802046 there are dangers your race hasnt encountered yet one is the ori its a debased religious cult that worships some of my people who despise free will and want total control of everything in a neighboring galaxy are the wraith essentially a vampiric life form
802047 my people have been able to protect the milky way for millennia and moros and i merlin and i helped create a cache of weapons for human use in the event the ori become a threat
802048 no i went back to my people merlin stayed and is still waiting
802049 i came back because i was intrigued by your peoples renewed interest in the arthurian legends
802050 yes i was too curious and had to see how well the truth was represented i came to new york in 1961 to see the musical i stayed because i was intrigued and impressed by how much progress humans had made
802051 well that was fun the music was intriguing the surge of concern over the state of the world the environment viet nam civil rights i was there in washington when doctor king gave his speech at the lincoln memorial
802052 and what would i have told you you were literally a babe in arms and as helen i shouldve been as well
802053 hey you know me always ready for some good lovin
802054 you have the cutest the sexiest ass ive ever seen
802055 oh i plan to celebrate and we just started sit here
802056 i missed you too ive never forgotten you even after sam and i
802057 i know just as i know how much sam means to you
802058 i wont pretend to be sam but i can be your helen
802059 i dont know if i love sam i mean i love you but sam
802060 janet for what its worth i love sam too i love her for the joy she brought you i love her because she is one of those rare spirits that cares really cares about others
802061 then i accept your offer i want to see more experience more
802062 wait til i show how intense our coupling can be

802079 larma una attitudine che diventata una cultura della resistenza diventata la cultura delle generazioni che realizzeranno il sogno di annientare quella entit predatoria israele permettetemi di commemorare un grande e leggendario comandante leroe mujahid combattente della jihad e martire imad mughniyeh il capo di hezbollah per le operazioni terroristiche allestero responsabile di attentati con centinaia di vittime innocenti ucciso a damasco lo scorso febbraio voglio dire solo una cosa hajj imad saremo degni del sangue da te versato solo quando costringeremo questo nemico a rimpiangere i tuoi giorni
802080 ieri a questora ero nelle mani dei nemici ieri a questora ero ancora nelle loro mani ma adesso non c nulla che desidero di pi che incontrarli di nuovo chiedo ad allah di farlo accadere presto si illude chiunque pensi che la liberazione delle terre libanesi e delle fattorie shabaa conquistate da israele alla siria nel 1967 ma dal 2000 reclamate dal libano come pretesto anti israeliano possa portare alla fine di questo conflitto
802081 c un morbo in questa regione chiamato stato di israele che noi chiamiamo entit predatoria se non poniamo fine a questo morbo ci perseguir sino in capo al mondo per questo meglio sbarazzarsi di lui
802082 hezbollah ha continuato a cercare i dispersi vivi o martiri non aveva nessuna ragione per compiere unoperazione in mio favore se non la sua fede nel valore della vita umana sic ricordo che il segretario generale nasrallah una volta ha detto se samir kuntar in prigione significa che tutto il libano in prigione ecco il valore della vita umana
802083 ecco un dono un mitra da parte della resistenza islamica per leroe liberato il tenente colonnello samir kuntar mujahideen combattenti della jihad come samir kuntar e i suoi fratelli non si curano di se stessi perch hanno votato se stessi alla resistenza alla causa alla patria
802084 il dono speciale della resistenza si combina con le parole di kuntar che ha giurato che questo mitra far la sua parte nel vendicare il sangue dei martiri
802085 questo il pi bel regalo dopo la libert stessa desidero porgere il mio saluto alla resistenza islamica e al segretario generale nasrallah per la loro fiducia innanzitutto questo il modo con cui la resistenza islamica riafferma la sua fede in me come combattente in secondo luogo questo mitra far la sua parte ad allah piacendo nel vendicare il sangue di imad mughniyeh
802086 se mi domandate se ho ucciso degli israeliani s lho fatto allah sia lodato e ne sono orgoglioso se ne avr la possibilit ad allah piacendo ne uccider ancora per quanto riguarda i bambini questa unaltra storia una ragazzina venne uccisa durante loperazione nel fuoco incrociato in tutte le operazioni che comportavano la cattura di ostaggi israeliani gli ostaggi vennero sempre uccisi dai proiettili delle forze israeliane lo stesso avvenuto nella mia operazione
802087 no me lo hanno impedito altri fratelli in carcere hanno completato il master ma a me lhanno impedito per ragioni che non conosco
802088 ha dichiarato che avrebbe fatto parte della resistenza ma oggi lei sta dicendo che sar un combattente armato e che condurr operazioni militari per la resistenza islamica
802089 harp what do guys want im a pretty intelligent good hearted girl who has a lot to offer any man but all the men i know or meet invariably end up having some sort of congenital aversion to anything even vaguely resembling long term emotional commitment to settling down getting serious getting married why is that im a fun sweet person i make my own money i have lots of rewarding relationships in my life i know how to be in a good relationship im a mature grown up person and id like to get married someday doesnt everyone dont guys isnt that the whole point finding that special someone falling in love getting married settling down having children growing old together isnt all that like the grand prize of life then why is it that if a girl on a date so much as scratches an itch on her ring finger the guy shes with acts like shes sprayed him with mace who do these men think theyre going to get involved with if not one of the women they actually meet what is it that men want what in the world are they looking for do they even know

802143 this is how we met my varsa and i i was spending a few days in valsad enjoying the anonymity that this town gave me after all it is not easy being the sexiest most talented man alive and to be mobbed by adoring women wherever i go so here i was just me and my burkha my baseball cap my guitar my hairdresser and some 50 bodyguards i wandered the marketplace and the shopkeepers thought i was maulvichachas daughter rehana returned from the middle east

802146 after all as long as there are men in this city they will need underweeyar banian and as long as even a single desi is alive outside india they will grab a bottle of pickle in a desi store as if they have found the elixir of life no matter how many other moldy pickles are rotting uneaten in their pantries

802178 gary snyder is in essence a contemporary devotional poet though he is not devoted to any one god or way of being so much as to being itself his poetry is a testament to the sacredness of the natural world and our relation to it and a prophecy of what we stand to lose if we forget that relation
802179 gary snyder is a true nature poet theres no sentimentalism to his work and he never uses the natural world simply to celebrate his own sensibility a deeply learned and meditative artist an impassioned ecologist and a poet of great scope as well as intense focus snyder has written poems that we will be reading for as long as weve been reading robert frost

802190 i cant explain it but when i closed the final volume i started writing poetry
802191 and yet i loathed him the man who enclosed himself in his cork lined room to write he said if someone came knocking on my door and i was working on my novel i wouldnt answer and i thought thats not the kind of writer i want to be i want to be the kind of writer whose writing would make people open that door

802211 in 2004 there were all sorts of media reports that sex workers were coming from all over the country to new york city because there were going to be so many potential customers during the republican national convention

802221 calistoga was lying on his back with bag of catnip over his face he lay there quietly for about 15 minutes and then jumped up and said ive got it we all laughed at him but he was resourceful he sold the idea like a box of corn flakes to those millionaires i mean a cat heading an expedition to find the link between the prehistoric cat and the self righteous siamese come on but he was a smart kitty he knew those financiers couldnt resist taking a chance on an expedition into an area where there was liable to be oil he got all the oil barons on board and he didnt need anybody else
802222 the landscape was awesome and empty with rocky outcroppings sand dunes escarpments barren mountain peaks and gravel covered plains it was a virtual cat box
802223 after walking a few yards i found myself looking into a sweeping basin filled with spectacular formations cut by erosion into massive walls of reddish orange sandstone
802224 everyone was gathered for lunch and calistoga walked up with his paws outstretched
802225 he had found a nest of dinosaur eggs the first eggs discovered that were not laid by birds
802226 when i cleared away all the debris i exposed a fragment of a skeleton of a quadrapedal mammal it appeared to have died in the act of raiding the nest i knew i had found what i had been looking for this was the great meezadon velociraptor toothy siamese who is a swift thief i had found the missing link i imagined i could see his blue eyes flashing when i lifted pieces of his skull and his 12 inch long teeth and placed these carefully in my bag i could feel what the meezadon felt when he discovered the eggs so very long ago i imagined him thinking quick dinner i could almost taste the egg as the shell was broached by his hideously long teeth
802227 we were cheek by jowl a lot of hissing could be heard i got cat scratched several times it was impossible to hear calistogas speech it was impossible to get to the case that held the eggs and the predatory meezadon it was such a sensation i returned several times over the next month to look the missing link in the eye and to contemplate how it used its imposing teeth i still shudder when i think of it today
802228 i was surrounded by chinese bandits i had to protect the bones of the ancients that were in my possession i pulled out the bullwhip and by some fortunate happenstance i managed to wrap it around the neck of the nearest robber i pulled with all my might and his head came off with a big gush of blood

802238 like i said you create your own reality on or off line the world mirrors your predominant thoughts
802239 my predominant thoughts were about the end of my presidential campaign and financial ruin

802251 bless me father for 19 years i was the most beloved economist on wall street these are my sins
802252 i precipitated the collapse of most of the respected banking institutions in modern america throwing caution to the wind i allowed every american to believe they could afford the american dream whether or not he had two nickels to rub together
802253 uh bless me father for i have sinned ive uh never confessed before in fact im not catholic but i feel i need to atone for my sins
802254 i pushed the dream of universal home ownership at the american public and encouraged individuals with low incomes and poor credit ratings to seek mortgages from predatory lenders i felt the market was wide open and they way to lift everyone up was to give them the ability to own their own homes
802255 these are our sins we created a government monopoly on mortgages through fannie mae and freddie mac in essence we forced bankers to grasp at the dregs of mortgages when the housing boom was on all that was left to them were jumbo loans and bad quality debt
802256 i am sure there are other sins you could confess to perhaps the fact that you have done nothing to help homeowners who took on too much debt
802257 mr cayne does 2 5 trillion in toxic debt which brought your firm to bankruptsy mean anything to you

802259 does a bailout by the american people mean anything to you i guess you got yours so it doesnt matter
802260 o cato dont you know that it is your responsibility as a feline to listen to the sins of man to listen to his confessions this is what cats do they listen with unconditional love and they purr out their absolution
802261 you have managed to sidestep your responsibility you have been too opinionated and sought recognition in the world of humans as a presidential candidate for gods sake you have taken up watching television reality tv at that
802262 i know you do not feel up to the challenge but you are inherently a saint all cats are it is time to take up your halo and offer succor to the human race
802263 they they are evil they are driven by greed they would walk over one another to win at all costs even if the prize is just a ribbon a certificate or a promise wealth in the future i will not offer these morons comfort
802264 ive shorted the financial sector and made enough for the month lets dine out ill worry about how to pay the taxes later
802265 you do realize that this is all a delusion that it arises from your mind your consciousness and then dissolves back into itself everything you think is real is just in your mind the emotions too all in your mind lose all your money make millions and live happily ever after retreat to the safety of your own home the stability of the economy it all begins in right here
802266 bless me father for i have sinned i have never confessed before
802267 this is my sin i believe my mind is perfect i believe within my consciousness lies all treasure i believe that despite the racing of my thoughts there is something beyond this reality an awareness that resides in eternity that has intelligence and wisdom i believe we are all party to this inner god
802268 i do not believe in any of this earthly pain i do not believe in financial hardship greed heartache ownership or ill health i believe all these exist only within the mind i am sorry san catio but you cannot give me absolution for seeing this reality there is something beyond the shadow banking system and its vast wealth there is something beyond bad hair there is something beyond the roll of the dice
802269 i want you to come on my show as the most spoiled and entitled cat in the world

802278 to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified
802279 a lot of things interest me about the programme the huge ensemble cast and the fact that there are no stars the sheer honesty of the writing it makes just about all of the writing on british tv look absolutely shit it maddens me that bbc or itv put out crap after crap after crap and they dont pick up something like this we dont know what to do with quality we wouldnt recognise it if it bit us in the arse all of the hbo stuff shows up how poor and puerile we are and how our tv people completely patronise the public
802280 take them to a amp e to visit the victims
802281 right now whats going on in the hearts and minds of the characters you are writing about
802282 i did not plan on writing a series but even before the first book the publisher wanted more the interesting part of it was that like even though i had a lifetime history of writing i had not written a novel so when i started and the agent submitted it i got all the classic rejections not our kind of book and hes good but lets see the next one when it was bought i had been turned down by 30 plus companies
802283 when i spoke to him the publisher i said can i ask why you bought the book but i reminded its too late to back out and he said i sat down and by the time i got to the end of chapter 3 i loved the characters i wanted to be with them wanted to know what they were going to do i was involved with them
802284 i didnt want the alcoholic burned out detectives down on life i wanted them to have real lives if trf has one too many sub plots its because its the first and readers had to be given real feeling for the characters
802285 so i asked my son how old he was when he learned three he said you told us about the penis and how you put it in the vagina we told all kids and well we were modern parents they were raised differently you have to learn all about the character
802286 you can write that marshall has lost 21 pounds in the last 4 months and he looks fantastic
802287 i live 100 miles from the big city new york where people walk up and down the inside aisles of the supermarkets they dont go down the outside aisles where the fruit and the vegetables are they go where the donuts cookies and candies are its pathetic they have motorised scooters probably invented for people who were handicapped but you dont see the handicapped people just big fat assed people who have to reach up into the beer cooler for another 24 pack
802288 why do these books resonate so well in the uk why have they had such a good reception there i feel like theres prince william theres prince harry and theres me i feel very grand
802289 one of the qualities i try to bring to writing and phone calling and talking to waitresses or anything is a total sense of irreverence get off your high horse and have a little fun if you can deflate the importance of things then great irreverence is a quality i cross the line 20 times a day well perhaps not so much any more and then i have to
802290 terry is the voice of all that he certainly has a way of bringing out the portentousness in things i have a little fun with american culture and when i write about a hollywood producer who fired a dozen chickens off the set and then bought them back and served them for lunch the next day well i made that up but it was founded in fact
802291 i am a former insider i bend and massage the truth but the hideous people you see were all real and i cant name any names id wind up with a lawsuit
802292 my agent said while there is a lot of interest in what you write and how you write the studios who should be making these films wont do it as it makes them look so hideous they dont want to make a film that craps over the industry
802293 i am afraid that if holywood came knocking i would say who is involved and my wife might say how much i do believe that what i do is a blend of art and commerce and i have a film agent in california who takes calls about the books and would be glad to sell it as a movie
802294 if someone offered to make a lomax and biggs movie i wouldnt just take the money and run
802295 when my son was 7 he said i figured out the difference between mom and dad they walk past a vacant lot and mum goes uh oh a place for winos and addicts and dad goes wow this is so cool we could build a theme park or a playground thats me the glass is more than half full
802296 dont know how i got it but it came and my wife and i are perfect counter points she thinks i live in lala land and i think she sees doom and gloom in everything i am optimistic about everything and it makes a difference in the things i like i dont want to write misery i want to fix it
802297 i have been with them since right after 9 11 like so many of us i had a 9 11 life changing moment of epiphany my daughter was at ground zero she escaped unharmed but was missing for 90 minutes 90 minutes doesnt seem like a long time unless youre watching the buildings collapoe and dont know where your daughter is

802312 in the 400 you want to see how long you can distribute that maximum amount of energy over 44 seconds
802313 the first 200 metres go by like nothing then the race starts slowing down the longest part is the last 10 metres its like im almost there im getting tired
802314 youre aware of your own body i can feel every part of my body if its good how its acting which area needs more power you can feel people behind you you get a sense of that you just get a sense of where your body is energy wise and you do think a lot but its not like thinking about what am i having for dinner you dont hear the crowd you never hear people screaming or shouting your name its just you and running
802315 that was the first time i ever saw him lose his cool
802316 he didnt know the start commands or have people ready then the gun goes off what could i do just run i wanted to win a championship to know youre capable of doing it it just got the best of my emotions theres so much testosterone it got to me
802317 he gave up seven metres at the start and caught everyone except the guy who was ranked fourth in the world
802318 that was impressive there are different steps of development from age 22 to 24 people can change you cant crush the spirit you cant come down hard on them
802319 he gets portrayed as an isolationist but thats what it takes for him to prepare
802320 we have a certain level we want to perform at and were never satisfied
802321 if he runs a fast time i want to run faster i want to break it it definitely gets competitive
802322 it just doesnt concern me if his rivals use them
802323 i dont educate myself on that kind of stuff i just try to run fast since 2001 its been a process every year builds up and you get a little faster in 2005 that was my breakthrough year in 2006 i hit a slump in 2008 ive been building for a very good start at the olympics

802344 but i guess they ignore the things they dont like such as mccain voting in favor of health insurance companies always having to pay for viagra but not birth control which he is not knowledgeable to be interviewed about but knowledgeable to vote on or calling his wife a c or even his idea of abortion because if you supported hillary you clearly support the idea that even birth control is considered abortion because if mccain says he supports womens rights well clearly he does especially in comparison with that jerk obama who holds true your democratic ideas but he was selected so hes evil everything he says is wrong way to send yourselves back to the medieval ages
802345 there are about 5 6 million people between 45 and 65 years of age and less than a million of those have a secure future in terms of their superannuation and their health funding
802346 but also quite a few of them now recognise that superannuation isnt going to provide them the financial platform that they need when they retire
802347 in terms of thinking about other sources of funding to fund old age including health you know some said well well probably rely on the state or potentially on family or indeed personal assets
802348 the traditional approaches to dealing with old age and health care which is basically to try and support people in their homes but then move them into various institutions just wont work anymore
802349 and then of course youve got the ever increasing costs of health care and the fact that people are living longer and are therefore going to need more serious care for much longer
802350 none of that i think has been adequately addressed and to be honest the healthcare system is struggling even today to manage todays issues let alone thinking 20 years ahead
802351 because the private health sector is going to be quite happy to provide further services for people who can pay but what about the four million who cant

802384 to tackle the teacher shortage and attract and retain quality teachers we need to offer rewarding salary and career structures
802385 establishing a national assessment and classification structure for accomplished teachers is possible based on standards and criteria already being used in various ways across the states
802386 currently there are few options for such teachers other than to move into leadership and administrative roles which take them and their teaching abilities out of the classroom where they are most needed
802387 this proposal from the profession is timely as coag the council of australian governments is developing its national partnership on teacher quality

802405 on one 429 000 home a client wanted me to sell the seller wanted to give the broker a 30 000 bonus on top of the commission i told him it wouldnt help i told him to just drop the price
802406 if you dont get any calls on your listing price after a week drop your price 10 000 or about 2 percent of your original asking price
802407 the market will tell you what the price of your home is you better be priced 10 percent under your competition and then be prepared to think about accepting offers under that
802408 previous attempts to find better ways of encouraging skin cell growth have used chemical additives and other elaborate techniques to produce scaffolds but their success has been limited weve found that skin cells are actually very smart its in their dna to sort themselves into the right arrangement they just need a comparatively uncomplicated scaffold and each other to help them grow in a safe natural way
802409 when we talk about pushing a tests limit of detection or lod were referring to the signal to noise ratio
802410 its really a matter of figuring out how to reduce the background noise and make the signal stand above the noise
802411 we identified a location that has the maximal signal to noise ratio
802412 by focusing on this signal rich point of light we extended the lod by two orders of magnitude
802413 about 90 percent of our time was spent in sample preparation not actually performing the assay
802414 with further integration and automation of the test the time could be reduced significantly
802415 the optical sensor requires a more expensive set up because of the confocal microscope
802416 so in a small dental or doctors office the electrochemical sensor generally would be easier and cheaper to use but to really push down the signal to noise ratio the optical sensor has the advantage
802417 but the technology is advancing so rapidly its difficult to predict how the optical sensor might be used in the years to come
802418 at this point it has certainly pushed the envelope for the limit of detection and this will be an important capability in advancing salivary diagnostics

802430 thank you all for coming welcome to the white house im pleased to sign a bill that will help homeowners who are struggling with rising mortgage payments the mortgage forgiveness debt relief act of 2007 will protect families from higher taxes when they refinance their homes it will help hardworking americans take steps to avoid foreclosure during a period of uncertainty in the housing market
802431 in recent months our nations housing market has faced serious strains
802432 my administration has taken strong steps to help homeowners avoid foreclosure by making it easier to refinance loans
802433 the bill i sign today will help this effort by ensuring that refinancing a mortgage does not result in a higher tax bill under current law if the value of your house declines and your bank or lender forgives a portion of your mortgage the tax code treats the amount forgiven as money that can be taxed and of course this makes a difficult situation even worse when youre worried about making your payments higher taxes are the last thing you need to worry about so this bill will create a three year window for homeowners to refinance their mortgage and pay no taxes on any debt forgiveness that they receive and its a really good piece of legislation the provision will increase the incentive for borrowers and lenders to work together to refinance loans and it will allow american families to secure lower mortgage payments without facing higher taxes
802434 i thank both the senate and the house for their quick passage of this important piece of legislation
802435 todays legislation is one piece of a larger plan the president has put forward to help able homeowners avoid foreclosure
802436 preventing avoidable foreclosures will reduce the impact of the housing slowdown on homeowners our communities and our economy
802437 on behalf of the many individuals and families who would have been burdened by a tax after losing their home the national assn
802438 nar has been advocating for such a change to the irs tax code for nearly 10 years
802439 todays bill will ensure that any debt forgiven on a mortgage secured for a principal residence will not be taxed this is very significant legislation this may also mean that some day in the future these families can once again achieve the dream of homeownership
802440 yes i was personally liable for repayment of the debt
802441 416 834 and in box 4 is says the fair maket value is

802445 indebtedness which is incurred in acquiring constructing or substantially improving any qualified residence of the taxpayer
802446 forgiven in order for the homeowner to keep the property
802447 indebtedness which is incurred in acquiring constructing or substantially improving any qualified residence of the taxpayer
802448 thank you all for coming welcome to the white house im pleased to sign a bill that will help homeowners who are struggling with rising mortgage payments the mortgage forgiveness debt relief act of 2007 will protect families from higher taxes when they refinance their homes it will help hardworking americans take steps to avoid foreclosure during a period of uncertainty in the housing market
802449 one scenario would when you have a 1st and 2nd on a primary residence with the same lender a short sale would wipe out all of the 2nd and part of the 1st the lender forgives the 2nd entirely and restructures the 1st the homeowner keeps the house and the lender avoids a foreclosure or short sale that lowers the surrounding comps even more
802450 is there any difference between a short sale and a foreclosure with respect to seasoning
802451 were not sure how the credit bureaus are representing those transactions
802452 depends on how the lender has chosen to report it to the credit bureau
802453 theres no benefit to a short sale as opposed to a straight foreclosure
802454 foreclosures are now being challenged on the basis that the lender cant readily prove they own the loan this creates leverage in the hands of a skillful attorney
802455 adding to catherines last comment is that because the investor buyer needs the lowest price they are not usually the sellers best option
802456 in florida i am hearing of situations where the best end result is a deed in lieu with the lender agreeing to not seek a deficiency
802457 hey ive got to sell and im upside down but youre ok with that arent you youll simply discount the note right
802458 if you refinanced you likely lost what ever non recourse protection you had so the lender may be able to come after a deficiency if they elected to do so and thought there was a chance they could get it
802459 the party offering the 825k wants to begin a negotiation with the two banks involved in the short sale so hes starting with a low ball offer on purpose
802460 what are they going to say no even if that is the right answer the catch 22 is that you wont know if youre going to get chased until the foreclosure is a fait accompli
802461 after reviewing the information you provided we must advise you your request for pre foreclosure sale has been denied for the following reason s we are unable to come to a mutual agreement regarding your request for a workout there may be other alternatives that will assist you but are contingent upon agency investor approval they are but may not be limited to based on the information you have supplied we are unable to identify an alternative workout program at this time if you would like to discuss this decision or would like to consider other options please call us at 800 416 1472 monday through friday 8am to 8pm central time for additional assistance you may call consumer credit counseling services at 800 569 4287 sincerely borrower counseling services

802587 enlightenment is not a learning but an unlearning a letting go of all the fears weve gathered as weve walked the path of life as taught in a course in miracles miracles are everyones right but purification is necessary first purification is the process by which everything but love dissolves from our mind as we drop the layers of fear and illusion that have hardened around our psyches we are left with the love with which we were endowed at our creation just as embryonic cells are programmed to develop into a baby each of us is programmed to develop a more magnificent life an invisible hand guides the embryo and guides you and me as well but unlike the embryo you and i can refuse it god didnt create us as babies and then just dump us here and say okay kid now youre on your own but how do we know that if were not taught to listen to our hearts how can we go with the flow if we dont know such a flow exists and so we keep going around saying no to life and then wondering why life seems to be saying no to us

802604 shayne bannan called me with the news and i was on the table getting treatment with my knee all bandaged up in ice and an electro stimulator attached and he said weve got that second place i looked at my swollen knee and thought oh good for you
802605 he discovered and trained me for four years everything that i am today in diving is because of him i also owe so much to my parents who have supported me and are my inspiration going into the olympics
802606 when i was drafted into the national team it was a dream come through as i knew that i would get even better support
802607 i was determined to make the best of the opportunity
802608 winning gold in korat was important as i needed to know just what my chances would be to qualify for the olympics once i won gold i knew that i would qualify
802609 we trained for two months in kunming china and it was very hard training was three sessions a day and staying away from family and friends was tough
802610 we aim to entertain middle eastern tourists who visit the country annually especially during this period of their summer
802611 we are unable to have a concert longer than three hours which will be the case if our artistes are also featured
802612 both ziryab and malaysia understand the importance of bridging cultures which is the main objective of the festival
802613 i have hosted other game shows although this is technically a game show it feels more like a talk show whether you win money or not becomes less important than sharing what it is that you need to talk about in a way it has become an issue based talk show
802614 with the moment of truth while you think its for money i think for most of the time they need to get something off their chest they want to say it even if its not for money its strange
802615 i personally wouldnt play the game however i have found out that many contestants didnt come on the show for the money
802616 many times i ask them if the money is worth the pain you are causing and they would say its not the money i think people come on the show to reveal things they wont say at home
802617 it sounds strange but its easier for them to say things they wouldnt have said at home because they could say its part of the game and they think they have to say it and then all of a sudden they are saying what they have been wanting to say for years and years
802618 thats not always the case because some people do come on the show just for the money i am actually the host who tells them maybe its time to take the money and go home dont answer more questions because its only getting harder and harder
802619 i know one married couple decided to separate after the show but they were only married for a short time and they were already separated a couple times before they came on the show
802620 but when people say the show has wrecked families and changed their lives those things dont happen as much as you would think remember by the time they appear on the show they have the chance to discuss all these questions with their families beforehand they know every question which is coming
802621 i am not very honest at all i feel like i am honest on the big stuff but i have noticed on the show how often i might be less than perfectly truthful sometimes i say have a great day to somebody but then maybe i am not really feeling that way or sometimes out of convenience i bend the truth a little so i think sometimes the show makes me realise how often i am not 100 per cent truthful
802622 when i was very young my father let me take the car to the corner to put gas in it i accidentally hit the side of the car and i didnt say anything for years when i was 19 or 20 years old i moved to california it was fathers day and i sent him a note and told him it took a long time but i had to come clean
802623 the test takes place over several hours in a very controlled environment they have time to discuss the questions with their families and friends and when they decide to be on the show the 20 questions that are asked on the show are chosen from the 50 that they have already been asked so they know the questions they know how theyve to answer them but they dont know the results of the polygraph test
802624 there are shocking questions like have you ever cheated on your spouse the audiences usually find those questions shocking then there are questions that might not be shocking but they are questions that are hard to answer for example do you resent your brother for making more money than you there is a difference between saying what you believe is true and what your heart really thinks is true thats when people end up in trouble because they overthink the questions and they answer the question the wrong way
802625 its partially because of the tone i set for the show its just not that environment what you get are tears and some frank discussions i have never seen anger or that kind of energy on the show
802626 even after the show even after those people lost their money theyd come up to me and give me a hug and thank me for the opportunity i think maybe a day or two later they may have some remorse
802627 at the beginning i didnt want to do the show at all it scared me and i didnt want to ask those questions but the experience is a positive one and i feel like a part of the audience because most of the answers that shock the audience also shocked me

802630 fashion changes so fast and we try our best to find interesting and unique merchandise on our buying trips and not just any run of the mill labels
802631 we want to sell fresh fashion forward brands which are distinguished with design influence
802632 with a multi brand store like m we have the liberty to develop everything from scratch including the logo brand mix furniture and the interior design its definitely more rewarding in spite of the long hours spent on deciding the finishing details of the store or just the clothes hanger to be used
802633 its more than just a boutique its a one stop shopping experience that covers everything from picking out a fabulous outfit to getting your hair done by andy ho haute coiffeur and make up by make up store and be ready for a night out
802634 we will now look at what we in the pkr can do for the people and the nation malaysia is rich in natural resources and has a multiracial population which has lived peacefully since merdeka
802635 we can understand that various factors have been keeping our national leaders busy
802636 but it is time for them to give more attention to the state of affairs in the component parties in the bn and to understand their viewpoints as well
802637 many perceived that the march 8 general election has given the nation some sort of uncertain verdict giving rise to much speculation about probable elections and a snap general election
802638 there is a need to stabilise the situation by initiating confidence building measures
802639 and one such measure is to have talks with individual component parties regularly and at various levels

802647 the man lived for 58 years it would be difficult to squeeze everything in a few hours to make the performance more focused i told u en to concentrate on ismails final three years the year 1970 was chosen because it was just after 1969 signaling a new beginning for malaysia it was also the year ismail became dpm
802648 the dialogue is made up although the facts of his life are correct rather than being a replication of his life its a replication of his spirit
802649 were doing this because we need stories like this to be told
802650 faridah merican has just finished sybil theres air con as well which ended its run recently dramas will never die but we need to nurture theatre and need to make it entertaining and people like to watch musicals when we get people to see something they want to see theyll eventually watch serious plays
802651 the man ismail impresses me he was honest sincere and stood by his beliefs
802652 it was faridahs idea to incorporate usmans poems they are a perfect accompaniment to the musical due to their socially conscious message and they go well with the drama
802653 im surprised and scared because i have to carry such a big role
802654 i showed up twice for the audition and got the part
802655 i wanted to get up close and personal so its the best way reading alone wont give an in depth portrayal of a person
802656 i have been looking at myself for three days now
802657 good thing its without sound otherwise it would have been even odder listening to myself
802658 i love make up because of the possibility of being able to create anything natural make up is great but if i can go all the way and be dramatic why not the next day i can do something else something entirely different
802659 i like mickey mouse its so graphic and it doesnt change
802660 its just make up you wash it off and tomorrow you start anew
802661 im not a chemist i dont know the technology that goes into creating make up but that blank slate gives me the advantage to see things differently i get to ask questions out of the box and do things differently
802662 i could go totally wild but chanel knows that i would not go insane with its make up because no one would use it then make up would have no point
802663 as i walked up the stairs and looked at the decor the apartment seemed to become very intimate i took a particular shade of gold to make the exclusive creations
802664 the joues contraste gold fever powder can be used for a dramatic and natural look
802665 the le vernis gold fiction can last for three weeks and still look like it has just been applied on the nails
802666 a woman can be really confident even without make up but cosmetics can make a woman feel special and send a look of confidence
802667 the only rule is dont be boring dress cute wherever you go
802668 therefore god also gave them up to uncleanness in the lusts of their hearts to dishonor their bodies among themselves who exchanged the truth of god for the lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever amen
802669 for this reason god gave them up to vile passions for even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust for one another men with men committing what is shameful and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due
802670 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a debased mind to do things which are not fitting being filled with all unrighteousness sexual immorality wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder strife deceit evil mindedness they are whisperers backbiters haters of god violent proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents undiscerning untrustworthy unloving unforgiving unmerciful who knowing the righteous judgment of god that those who practice such things are deserving of death not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them

802679 prices are already at the higher end of recent ranges andinvestors have no reason to buy now before the 10 year jgbauction and the fed meeting
802680 investors dont want to push 10 year yields below 1 5percent before the auction as yields are expected to graduallyinch lower given the bleak growth outlook for the japanese u s and euro zone economies
802681 qua non ci facciam mica prendere per il culo come gli italiani
802682 it has been seven years since jendela batik started and as the brand grows up and grows out of the batik mould a name change is necessary if we stick to batik the scope gets very limited we are not batik purists we are innovators of a lifestyle brand
802683 if it had used burberry plaid as a brand name then its scope would have been restricted and expansion wouldnt be possible
802684 we interpret the concept and ideas of a batik making process and translate them into design i dare not say were artists
802685 once you stitch the batik you dilute it an artisan would have spent 10 hours on four metres of cloth and you cut it to make baju kurung thats diluting batik
802686 the batik making process is rigorous its art and once you cut batik it becomes cheap it loses its value because now only you can wear it its no longer art
802687 jendela batik cannot move forward without diluting batik and i believe we cannot do that to this age old craft
802688 the batik pieces will be treated like a precious commodity like a birkin bag this is not your usual batik not the kind sold in markets it is an art form and in my view this ancient craft has maintained as an art form and that will never change
802689 you cannot take it very far competition is stiff and production cost is high because you need skilled artisans for the job
802690 i love the idea of using wax on fabric and i think the batik process is beautiful
802691 with the latest technologies its possible to transfer this art form on other things not just clothing and by interpreting a batik design i think we are also raising the standards of batik
802692 i hope this allows us to develop a malaysian brand which is a malaysian icon with asian products and a universal appeal
802693 shanghai tang is too chinese in its looks while jim thompson is too thai jendela kl can have a more universal image because of our religious and cultural diversity its about time an asian brand comes out of malaysia
802694 due to conditions in the credit markets and changes in the companys retail strategy
802695 the liquidity provided by these facilities will enable us to support our dealers and their retail customers
802696 here is your room the children you are getting will come and see the room and meet you on friday and you will have them on monday
802697 presenci el hecho primero hubo adultos jorge abedrapo y un grupo de dirigentes del colegio de profesores que iban concertados para realizar un tipo de acciones e interrumpieron un acto que se estaba iniciando stos tambi n son responsables y nosotros no participamos porque no estamos de acuerdo con eso porque estamos por el di logo por otro lado cuando un adulto no escucha a un adolescente y cuando la ministra sale mirando para otro lado ante el requerimiento de la joven uno puede esperar una reacci n
802698 my goal is to inspire and energize with ideas and possibilities that will challenge people to expand their perceptions of teaching and learning and dare to consider our professional future with optimism and excitement
802699 what happens to those who are not selected for a program
802700 then you have to undo some of the perceptions that exist as a result of that process
802701 i do everything i possibly can to remember peoples names
802702 its so much more effective when you call somebody by their first name
802703 its almost like i dont think hes a principal to 2 000 kids i think hes a principal to me
802704 i dont even know how he knew me or knew my name
802705 he makes me want to be more involved and makes me want to do better at my school if all the teachers were like him wed probably have the best school
802706 a policy whether its about bullying or wearing hats in school or cafeteria behavior always applies to someone else
802707 when something happens to someones child the parents typically want a policy but when their child is not the victim but the instigator its a different story the student has a great record why go hard with one mistake she feels horrible about it cant we let it go with an apology
802708 gave her an opportunity to regroup and provided a moment for everyone else to be reassured that no great threat existed
802709 its that the way to help children is not to isolate them not to punish them because of some arbitrary policy
802710 i hope you enjoyed the chilly air and warm sunshine over the weekend
802711 at this point i cant see starting the classroom day any other way
802712 it speaks thousands of words to kids when you notice them
802713 it all boils down to living the golden rule and being respectful and being treated the way you want to be treated and doing the right thing
802714 i was astonished to hear my number being called for the award
802715 the award you gave me was a great way to end my football season at sunrise middle school thanks once again it will be something ill cherish for the rest of my life
802716 people are looking at each other and instead of saying you with the red sweater they call you by name
802717 it becomes more personal its like if an animal has no name someone will kick it as a stray when you call it duke its different
802718 everybody feels like jefferson school is made up of jane linda barry
802719 because they know we take them seriously by listening to them they become more and more articulate
802720 they dont become jaded they dont become blas and have an attitude
802721 have some say in the quality of teaching they get
802722 the teachers and i are being evaluated not for a grade but for self improvement since you are the reason the school exists we would like your feedback to help our teachers improve so we ask you to do this teacher evaluation with honesty
802723 it definitely makes you aware of your teaching and your practice
802724 now that we do the evaluations twice a year students get to feel as though their feedback has a positive impact on the learning environment in the present year not something that gets thrown out and does not affect them
802725 this gives them power in that their words are taken seriously
802726 the more connections you can build between school and home the more students feel secure and safe in their schools
802727 when students are well prepared to tell their own story they seem to experience a sense of responsibility pride and accomplishment
802728 absolutely hands down every session students wished that teachers would know their names and something about them
802729 clearly the new brain research on emotional engagement demonstrates strongly that peoples brains are more receptive to learning if they have a relationship with the teacher
802730 if you get a kid who is not carrying out what he said hed do instead of chastising the kid you want to keep a relationship
802731 did you do what you said youd do if not what do you think caused you not to do it are you happy with that choice did it help you get where you want to go you want to be able to teach the kids that life is a series of choices some are successful some are unsuccessful
802732 if teachers make comments to kids that are personally challenging or insulting to them as a person the kids will never look at their own behavior
802733 i knew what to expect every step of the way
802734 to close the gap between the way we prepare teachers and the way teachers actually teach in the classroom
802735 my mentor teacher is an amazing woman she has a very strong presence in the classroom and the students know that she means business and that she cares
802736 the ed school is the rodney dangerfield of higher education
802737 criticisms of the teacher education establishment have been so incessant and persistent that the work of that establishment is changing
802738 some people have the philosophy that teachers should go right into the fire and i disagree with that theres some in between thats good to gradually take on the role with some thought behind it getting to observe before doing
802739 the key to the success of these programs is that no matter what theory students are learning about they get to see it in practice immediately
802740 you can make people go to school for five years and tell them to read any number of books but they wont really learn anything until theyre in an actual classroom
802741 back in the early 90s we used to evaluate peoples writing by giving them a multiple choice exam this is not rocket science but if you want to test how well people write youve got to ask them to write these tests are sorely needed
802742 rotten schools of education can place bad students in failing k 12 schools with weak teachers
802743 historically a school of education could claim to be strong and be recognized around the country with no evidence about how its teachers perform in the classroom
802744 if i am to get through these math lessons or this language arts curriculum when am i supposed to teach the sel skills thats the parents job
802745 without sel skills and knowledge how can we possibly teach and have students learn effectively

802747 important but not for me parents and students in kansas and missouri talk about math science and technology education
802748 the great numbers of high paying jobs of the future that are claimed to require college graduation and high academic skills for all high school students are a hoax the majority of the jobs of the future in wisconsin and the united states are low or average paying jobs that require short term or moderate term on the job training and do not require high level academic skills in any academic areas particularly in higher mathematics
802749 technology makes jobs simpler not more difficult and makes workers more productive the great majority of the jobs of the future are the same jobs of the twentieth century with new technological tools that make these jobs easier to do the jobs of the future in wisconsin in 2016 are essentially the same jobs in existence in 2006 a majority of jobs in 2016 about 52 percent are projected to require short term on the job training or experience less than a month or moderate length on the job training experience or education one to twelve months
802750 it is not appropriate or constructive to require all high school students to pass three years of higher math and science courses and to meet the requirements for a four year college to earn a high school diploma no more than 5 percent of all jobs might require higher math and science skills and only about 23 percent of all jobs require a bachelors degree or more short moderate or long term job training work experience postsecondary vocational training or an associate degree is required for about 77 percent of all jobs there is an abundance of well educated people for jobs that require higher levels of education and training the problem is available jobs not public education
802751 what job would you like to have as a grownup
802752 why are you putting all of this pressure on yourself at such a young age
802753 if i dont get into a good college i wont get a good job
802754 we feed the souls of teachers who then feed the souls of children
802755 teachers develop the basic skills in creating live music and then mold the music to the classroom

802768 perhaps strength doesnt reside in never having been broken but in the courage required to grow strong in the broken places
802769 we are continually faced with great opportunities which are brilliantly disguised as unsolvable problems
802770 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world

802775 so too christology tells us that the conceptual soundness of a scientific theory cannot be maintained apart from christ
802776 i was trying to force an issue a little bit too much with that lie i hit a horrible shot and then tried something to get it up there far enough and turned that into a triple and the tournaments over
802777 i thought maybe if i made that putt on 14 for par and maybe i can get a little momentum back but i missed that and the doors closed at that point
802778 everything was a positive except for my back nine yesterday and today
802779 im disappointed right now and i havent closed the deal yet this year and that upsets me more than anything ive been in position now five or six times to win and havent come away with it and theres some things i need to do ill figure it out
802780 i was considering last night not playing but i decided because i had so much family here wed give it a try
802781 hopefully i can recover in a couple of weeks plus its hometown you gotta play
802782 well i need to probably make another 130 000 to get in the top 30 so im exempt for next year
802783 im probably going to do that id like to play every one of them and ill definitely play all the ones we can ride
802784 this was a venue for our age group that was right on just spot on perfect
802785 that is the team that has hit me three times already it seemed so obvious to me
802786 im not going to bring a guy in that throws 85 miles an hour to hit somebody
802787 ozzie doesnt play like that this team doesnt play like that
802788 we really bring out the best in each other sherris not only a great person to play with but shes a great ball striker
802789 i played great all week all week long and then today i make a couple mistakes on the back nine but it was a great great week fantastic for argentina and south america and for romero of course
802790 i won nine tournaments in europe and 85 tournaments in south america but this is the most important tournament of course
802791 its something to be proud of but its not a 54 hole tournament thats not what im here for
802792 its weird because most weeks on tour theres probably 20 guys or 10 guys who can win on the last day
802793 but obviously if parker is 20 under john rollins has to shoot 10 under if parker is even par so it does put a stretch on everyone including me
802794 but parkers never won before so you never know he might shoot a couple over and around this golf course anything can happen you can hit good shots and get a bad bounce and be really in trouble
802795 it was my first time having a lead and i didnt really approach it the right way and learned a lot from it
802796 that one i looked past the finish line too early and this one im looking forward to the first shot on the first hole tomorrow and thats as far as im going to go
802797 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
802798 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
802799 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
802800 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
802801 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
802802 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
802803 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
802804 i played great all week all week long and then today i make a couple mistakes in the back nine and when i start to make bogey i cant stop i start to make bogey bogey bogey greg norman played the masters he start to make a bogey he never stopped i remember about it but after that i make a good putt on the 15 and talked with my caddy i said we have to make one par thats all we will make and then we make a par on 15 and i start to finish with par
802805 this is very important very important because were working hard for golf in argentina this is very important very important
802806 this is such a fantastic tournament its beautiful when i come here and play the u s open i tell you its a dream to win a tournament and finally my dreams coming true im back to argentina with this cup its mine
802807 i thought i would maybe have a better shot at maybe getting up and down and getting at worst a 5 out of it
802808 and from there was a debacle the rest of the way
802809 its a problem for the club for sporting director pedja mijatovic and the coach
802810 but now wesley sneijder is injured and hes an important player for us maybe tomorrow there will be a meeting with the people in the club and maybe then theres going to be news about this
802811 i think theyre going to have to talk about this and if cristiano ronaldo is coming to real madrid the dressing room is waiting for him
802812 if he came of course the players and the fans would be excited the supporters are used to watching the best players in the world at the bernabeu and cristiano ronaldo is one of the best players in the world
802813 i feel the best of real madrid is the squad and the dressing room and if cristiano is coming here we dont have room for him in the team
802814 but as i said before maybe with the injury to wesley sneijder maybe we need someone else
802815 in that situation i had to believe he was trying to hit me even with the bases loaded
802816 we were leading by six runs they come inside hard three times that is the team that has hit me three times already it seemed so obvious to me
802817 we wanted to set a tone coming into the new month and i think we did that
802818 my fastball had a lot of life and i made a lot of good pitches
802819 the simple fact is that quilts were handmade by people for people every phase of their production was permeated by giving and sharing from the trading of scraps and patterns to the actual production quilting was an essential human activity there is something about a quilt that says people friendship community family home and love
802820 i had a good putt on 17 i thought when i started it off it would go in but it just went a lot more than i thought
802821 and 18 i didnt start it far enough right i thought it was just outside the lip and it moved a foot
802822 but i hit some nice shots under pressure over the last few holes the wedge into 17 was a lovely shot one of the best ive hit for ages took the spin off it
802823 when i get into contention and play in the last group i feel very comfortable out there now
802824 ive got a routine im going through and nothing phases me too much
802825 i know as well as anybody what can happen and i know its not easy to finish off around this golf course because a lot can happen on the back nine theyre not easy holes
802826 you know things like seven do happen and to come back from that was great
802827 it wasnt a good finish for me but i played really well today
802828 for 14 holes i hit a lot of good shots a lot of good putts but im turning 63s and 64s into 70s and thats kind of what happened today i couldnt get any putts to go in and then in the end i made some bogeys
802829 i had to birdie one of the last two i figured
802830 the last three holes were playing i dont want to say easy but they were birdiable and i thought i needed to get to 11 under most likely
802831 i really played well this week and i played great today
802832 again i felt like i should have shot 63 or 64
802833 daddy get me that rock i want that rock up there

802843 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
802844 they leave the security council no choice but to increase the sanctions as called for in the last resolution passed
802845 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights

802850 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
802851 i want the michigan delegation and the florida delegation to be seated and however the democratic national committee determines we can get that done im happy to abide by those rules
802852 as a candidate for the nomination i supported the dncs efforts to establish and enforce a schedule for primaries and caucuses that would broaden the opportunity for democrats from all regions of the country and all backgrounds and walks of life to have a meaningful voice
802853 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
802854 during the campaign i strongly advocated for the democratic party to seat the florida and michigan delegation with their full votes the democratic party has always stood up for the principle of counting every persons vote today sen obama has requested that the credentials committee give florida and michigan delegates their full votes this is the right position for the democratic party and for the country and i urge the credentials committee to restore full votes to florida and michigan delegates
802855 this matter will be the top priority for the credentials committee when we meet on august 24 as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november

802874 we have been happily borne or perhaps have unhappily dragged our weary way down the long and crooked streets of our lives past all kinds of walls and fences made of rotting wood rammed earth brick concrete iron railings we have never given a thought to what lies behind them we have never tried to penetrate them with our vision or our understanding but there is where the gulag country begins right next to us two yards away from us in addition we have failed to notice an enormous number of closely fitted well disguised doors and gates in these fences all those gates were prepared for us every last one and all of a sudden the fateful gate swings quickly open and four white male hands unaccustomed to physical labor but nonetheless strong and tenacious grab us by the leg arm collar cap ear and drag us in like a sack and the gate behind us the gate to our past life is slammed shut once and for all
802875 power is a poison well known for thousands of years if only no one were ever to acquire material power over others but to the human being who has faith in some faith that holds dominion over all of us and who is therefore conscious of his own limitations power is not necessarily fatal for those however who are unaware of any higher sphere it is a deadly poison for them there is no antidote
802876 we have to condemn publicly the very idea that some people have the right to repress others

802900 well have to approach very quietly or we might scare it
802901 listen if that doe died after giving birth she probably was too old or too sick to survive it that might mean she wasnt able to feed this little thing either and thats not good if animal services cant get any milk into her she wont make it
802902 sadly the reason we cant do this as well inside our own species is because there are those who would as soon call you crazy as be touched by your experience
802903 the ability to look at our enemy or what we think is our enemy and see ourselves people animals that just want what we do
802904 i didnt know lavender was a greek flower good to know
802905 thus said hashem whoever remains in this city will die by the sword by the famine or by the pestilence whereas whoever goes out in surrender to the chaldeans will live he will have his life as a booty and he will live
802906 thus said hashem this city will surely be delivered into the hand of the army of the king of babylonia and he will capture it
802907 let this man be put to death now because he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who remain in this city and the hands of all the people by speaking to them such things for this man does not seek the welfare of this people but rather their detriment
802908 wouldnt it be weird if lots of other stuff in the bible were true too
802909 gonna give his bestfriend head while he is sleeping on the couch downstairs
802910 afterward if the report is a little positive then thats real important
802911 if its real negative thats important if its somewhere in between then were probably making too much of it
802912 i just love the fact we did not give up
802913 ive got to get ahead and mix up my pitches more
802914 i think i got a little predictable with what i was doing
802915 im turning 63s and 64s into 70s and thats what happened today
802916 i couldnt get any putts to go in and then in the end i made some bogeys for 14 holes i hit a lot of good shots had countless birdie opportunities from six to 15 feet i feel like im playing well but i just need to get that final piece of scoring down
802917 i had to be careful not to take too much club and go long
802918 i hit a sand wedge and if id caught it thinner it could have easily flown well over the green but instead it came up short it just wasnt that easy a shot
802919 i figured i had to birdie one of the last two
802920 im not smart enough to know whether its a long term injury or not but i would be concerned because he was not able to play today
802921 i would be able to play if it was comfortable i woke up this morning and it was hurting
802922 i just had to be comfortable over it i hit on the right edge and it actually started right where i aimed and went in the hole im really relieved
802923 i had a good finish there at the end i kept hitting a lot of good shots but my putting was not the best all day
802924 i struck the ball really well especially with my irons
802925 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
802926 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
802927 shiloh and z pick out the twins clothes and help change and hold them
802928 for us to begin a phased redeployment at a pace of one to two brigades per month at which point we would have our combat troops out in 16 months thats the goal that im setting
802929 what i will refuse to do is to get boxed in into what i consider two false choices
802930 either i have a rigid timeline come hell or high water and i am blind to anything that happens in the intervening 16 months or alternatively i am completely deferring to whatever the commanders on the ground says which is what george bush says hes doing in which case im not doing my job as commander in chief
802931 political factors inside iraq that came right at the same time as terrific work by our troops had those political factors not occurred my assessment would be correct the point i was making at the time was the political dynamic was the driving force in that sectarian violence
802932 i think its important to recognize that on the majority of issues that weve faced in terms of foreign policy not just over the past four years but over the past six seven years that my batting average is pretty darn good
802933 return to your religion and homeland before we defeat you
802934 and you will have peace and security we will not touch you but with kindness you must first declare your sincere repentance in front of your tribes and families and inform us by whatever means lest we make a mistake and kill you you should put your hands in the hands of your brothers and sons the mujahideen for peace and security to return to our homes and expel the invader and to expel the occupier from our midst in this blessed month
802935 i do not know what kind of authority he enjoys the sheik stated is he a prophet did he receive a messenger from god to give us a pardon are we criminals like him are we killers like him to be given a pardon or did we ask him for pardon on the contrary he should ask us for pardon because he killed iraqis sunnis and shiis who is he he is only an inferior criminal we should not grant him a pardon
802936 the anbar awakening was the result of a concerted plan executed by us forces in ramadi and tactical victory became a strategic turning point when farsighted senior leaders both iraqi and american replicated the ramadi model throughout anbar province in baghdad and other parts of the country dramatically changing the iraq security situation in the process
802937 were sick of getting killed on both sides by u s and aq so lets pick the americans
802938 j lo is dead and the pentagon is covering it up to boost morale

802940 its a dream youre outside a club with all your friends entering you discover the best djs and the newest cool bands in the uk you drink n dance and meet the boy girl of your dreams its the perfect club and then the rakes headline the whole lot you wet your pants its not a dream youre at the best night ever watching the rakes holding hands with the lover of your dreams and youve wet yourself
802941 wait system diagnostics well if i open up console i have those what if there was an additional process call it hybridd which emitted poetry to go along with the more prosaic debugging and whatnot that my computer spits out
802942 firebug seems to have defined the universe for this lot
802943 im really excited to be here and to have a chance to come back
802944 if im a little bit behind i have to make up that time and the only way to make up that time is full video game style you just start bouncing off stuff
802945 i kind of went for the brake and went a little bit wide and hit the wall there and bent the right rear corner of the car
802946 its my first x games gold medal 14 years in the making
802947 im not sure of the exact diagnosis but it was about a 10 foot air straight down onto my shoulder so thats never good
802948 the viewer in our demographic can connect with park skating way more than they will connect with vert
802949 it was going to be just like a vert ramp but bigger and cooler
802950 its definitely way too small we thought there would be lips 10 or 12 feet high
802951 id like to see some bigger gnarlier sections on there not so compact
802952 when this is all over well sit down with them and well say ok guys let us have it what do you want what do you like in skateboarding if i sit 10 guys down im going to get nine different opinions
802953 what do you expect the guy jumped over the great wall of china with a broken ankle
802954 weve just got to come out and continue playing good baseball
802955 i got some balls up got away with a few and we made some great defensive plays i located better i used my changeup better
802956 he lost 12 or 13 pounds after surgery gained a few back
802957 you guys tournaments sponsors the fans in venezuela who watch us on tv everybody misses him
802958 the doctors set a minimum of six months so thats what im assuming
802959 and he seems fine he seems his usual self he was limping a little bit at congressional but he said he started his rehab and he was excited about that because he had been bored to death in my mind its only a question of when he starts coming back and theres no doubt in my mind hell be the same tiger hes been
802960 i played great i really played well i played great today i felt like i should have shot 63 or 64 had countless birdie opportunities from 6 to 15 feet and then i make three bogeys on the last four holes and turn a 64 into a 70
802961 so i feel like im playing well i just need to get that final piece of scoring down
802962 maybe i hit it straighter than i used to maybe im smarter i dont know its definitely not smarter
802963 although i made a lot of birdies on the front nine i hit it pretty close
802964 on the back nine i started missing those four footers and five footers
802965 the five footer on 17 was a good putt went straight in the middle and the last putt i hit on the right edge and it started right where i aimed and went in
802966 im very very uncomfortable with four and five footers i practiced so hard last week on the putting and at the end of the day it paid off
802967 the key to my round was trying to hit the ball in the fairway and thats what i was doing so well today
802968 i drove the ball beautifully and hit a lot of good iron shots i felt really comfortable the swing change toward the end of last year is finally coming together
802969 i was really back against the wall after the double bogey five behind but i came back with a nice birdie on the next and just thought dig in there and see what happens
802970 i didnt start it far enough right and it moved a foot
802971 i missed it left on thursday and didnt learn anything and missed it left today
802972 when i get into contention i feel very comfortable now
802973 i hit nice shots under pressure the last few holes
802974 i felt very confident i was going to make it
802975 im really excited about this one in the 1946 series the b p r d was just two guys and one of them died in 1947 we see the humble beginnings of the bureau we know and love today
802976 we meet new agents some of whom will actually survive and we see more of young hellboy we start to see where his personality comes from and there are vampires my favorite creatures as we have never seen them before in the hellboy b p r d world and josh and i get to work with gabriel and f bio who really are geniuses i cant wait to see what they do
802977 this is a unique tale needing a unique approach and bringing f bio and gabriel into the family of hellboy artists is really exciting to all involved
802978 their work is amazing and were giving them an epic gothic tale a moody and shadowy nightmare unlike anything theyve done and darker scarier and more mysterious than anything weve done in such a long format
802979 lots of dreamy fantastic imagery and lots of muted character beats ive been a fan of f bio since i first read de tales i cant wait to see them dance on this thing
802980 i cant believe i did what i did i was as shocked as they were
802981 i cant believe i did what i did i was as shocked as they were
802982 i cant believe i did what i did i was as shocked as they were
802983 i cant believe i did what i did i was as shocked as they were
802984 i cant believe i did what i did i was as shocked as they were
802985 i cant believe i did what i did i was as shocked as they were
802986 i cant believe i did what i did i was as shocked as they were
802987 the problem is that during the spring and summer the only way to get there is by boat
802988 one time i had to take people back to the airport in the middle of the night and the sea was so choppy they threw up the whole way and had to get right on the plane soaking wet and exhausted
802989 is because in 1996 two girls were climbing up over there
802990 and they ran into a polar bear one of the girls jumped over the side
802991 just a few scratches and now we always have to have guns outside the town
802992 so the lesson is that if you run into a polar bear jump over the cliff
802993 istanbul means i go to the city and it is what many people called the city already
802994 the wierdest are what i first thought to be ugly little old village ladies working as prostitutes then i realized they were actually men dressed as little old village ladies
802995 well i decided that dogs never brushed their teeth and it never hurt them so why should i brush my teeth
802996 plus i liked to eat sugar cubes when i finally went to the dentist i had eight cavities and that was that
802997 estoy muy emocionada de estar en los juegos la dolencia en el tobillo dej de molestarme por lo que espero una buena competencia de mi parte

803005 fue un gran juego con dos equipos que quer an ganar con un rival como dragonas que tiene buen futbol y sin embargo morelia vino a vender cara la derrota tan es as que nos fuimos a tiempos extras y se conjug un error con un acierto para el gol
803006 este es un equipo ordenado sobre todo defensivamente en la liguilla del clausura 2008 recibimos s lo dos goles en ocho partidos y tres con ste que fue el menos goleado y que tuvimos gente arriba que nos falt hoy
803007 este grupo est formado por puras muchachas pertenecientes a la universidad michoacana y eso no nos quita m rito porque somos las campeonas nacionales y este deporte es de las revanchas
803008 el pr ximo fin de semana arranca el torneo y nosotros recibimos a las leonas negras de la universidad de guadalajara y en la semana hay que levantar al grupo an micamente darles oportunidad a que se relajen un poco y estar de lleno para defender la corona

803014 traemos ritmo de juego venimos fogueadas y eso es positivo creo que eso nos ayudar para llegar fuertes al torneo
803015 en lo personal me imaginaba la arena m s pesada pero est bien el calor es un factor importante pero estamos acostumbradas ya que entrenamos en mazatl n as que llegamos en buen momento
803016 la clave simplemente es ir a jugar no tenerle ning n respeto a los dem s equipos deportivamente hablando simplemente confiar en nuestras capacidades y no tanto confiar en el rival sino controlar nuestro lado de la cancha as que pienso con eso pueden salir cosas muy buenas
803017 nos cost much simo trabajo creo que la falta de definici n fue clave para llegar tan lejos creo que lo pudimos haber definido mucho antes
803018 hay que seguir revalidando que somos el mejor equipo de m xico llevamos dos torneos siendo l deres generales en uno de ellos fuimos campeones y en el segundo por circunstancias nos quedamos en semifinales pero vamos paso a paso para demostrar que somos el mejor equipo del pa s
803019 creo que hay que tener un poco m s de concentraci n en algunas situaciones ser m s constantes y muestra de ello fue este partido con dos equipos muy atentos pero al final se logr el triunfo

803039 peter costello made clear that hes not available for the leadership and that remains the case he did that the day after the election
803040 he flagged he was thinking about the next phase of his professional life that he would do that with his family and im sure thats what hes doing

803056 habitat destruction is a major threat to biodiversity throughout the world
803057 the caribbean is particularly vulnerable because it contains an unusually high percentage of endangered species and because these animals live on islands they have nowhere to go when they lose their habitat
803058 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
803059 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
803060 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive
803061 we had 13 specific audits in qantas engineering last year so we just see this as more of them casa doing their job which is to be the regulator
803062 what theyre doing i think is coming in and doing their job which is to make sure people have utter confidence in the safety of qantas but also the probity of the regulatory system
803063 casa audited qantas generally and qantas engineering specifically a great deal
803064 obviously events like manila where we had the aircraft depressurise they were an entirely different kind of a normal run of business things that are being reported almost daily
803065 firstly our aircraft travel around the globe how you avoid having them touched by foreign hands while you do that is a mystery to me
803066 but the second thing we have 7000 engineers employed in australia two thousand of those are doing heavy maintenance
803067 so that means the vast majority and i mean the vast majority of our work is actually done here in australia and has been for many many years and will continue to be
803068 qantas safety standards are so high and so well recognised that when we do have an accident like the other day with ojk the aircraft in manila its big news and were not afraid of the scrutiny
803069 these really dangerous fats are in everyday foods that people eat and particularly in junk and processed foods
803070 trans fats offer no nutritional value whatsoever and indeed are linked to serious health issues
803071 we believe the time to act on trans fats is now
803072 to tackle the teacher shortage and attract and retain quality teachers we need to offer rewarding salary and career structures
803073 establishing a national assessment and classification structure for accomplished teachers is possible based on standards and criteria already being used in various ways across the states
803074 currently there are few options for such teachers other than to move into leadership and administrative roles which take them and their teaching abilities out of the classroom where they are most needed
803075 this proposal from the profession is timely as coag the council of australian governments is developing its national partnership on teacher quality
803076 it is caught between a rock and a hard place the fed will stand pat

803080 america is turning into the kind of place where everything that isnt banned is compulsory
803081 the issue then as it is today is not some finite amount of liquidity to keep the banks solvent and markets liquid but instead the enormous ongoing credit creation and intermediation necessary to sustain levitated asset prices incomes corporate earnings and government receipts
803082 debt deflation is a particularly malign economic beast which emerges when people curb their spending in an effort to pay off their debts those very spending cuts cause prices to drop and force up the real value of debts creating a vicious spiral as the experience of america in the 1930s and japan in the 1990s shows central banks can do little about this because they cannot set interest rates lower than zero
803083 cheap money made no difference the federal discount rate was never more than 1
803084 in spite of what bernanke says the fed does not
803085 personally i was never a spender i guess its because i come from a different world the world of the great depression this was the world in which a dollar was hard to come by and a good dinner cost 75 hard earned cents its difficult to break old habits and im talking about habits like turning off leaky faucets or making sure all the lights are out before you go to bed i never could get used to spending more than i was earning or taking out loans on a car or buying a house with a mortgage attached
803086 money supply itself actually never contracted in japan instead it grew very slowly for quite some time however bank credit outstanding contracted for 60 months in a row clearly there was a credit contraction how did money supply still manage to grow fiscal deficits were ramped up immensely roads to nowhere were built and the bank of japan monetized all of it
803087 it is often remarked that japan is a rich country whose citizens have greater wealth than any other
803088 a country is not wealthy when one half owes debts to the other half that it can never repay
803089 economically roosevelts massive government borrowing spending scheme the same sort of solution that many people are advocating today was a total flop for the reasons that anyone with even a basic understanding of economics would appreciate for example during roosevelts first 6 years in office the federal governments debt ballooned astronomically in response to government spending on an unprecedented scale and yet the number of unemployed in america was higher in 1938 than it had been when roosevelt was first elected president in 1932 the grandiose spending was however a political success and thus fulfilled its primary objective

803101 it seems clear that unfair or deceptive acts and practices by lenders resulted in the extension of many loans particularly high cost loans that were inappropriate for or misled the borrower

803135 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who should be replaced and who should be appointed to which position
803136 in america they went crazy realising karadzic was making a fool of them
803137 the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic
803138 holbrooke strongly promised me that the hague tribunal would be history for karadzic if he withrdrew from politics forever

803259 i am a musician with fibromyalgia and fibromyalgia research is one of the most important things i can think of to use the gift of music for
803260 however these are my renditions of these songs and they are different from the originals by a significant degree the rest are songs i have written and these will be available for fibromyalgia research funding soon on cd or by download
803261 after only one lesson she can pick out the melody of all my songs i am 52 so we have a broad age range 107 years and we are all related
803262 the youngsters are thrilled to be helping me with my fibromyalgia and the research it gives me a big kick to watch their enthusiasm and their support they are great kids and i love them to bits for helping me their grandmother and their mother who has fms are pretty proud of them too
803263 my fibro first began to be a major problem when i was about 24 so i have had fibromyalgia most of my life i was an electronics engineer and finally in my 30s had to give up my career i had just bought a home to raise my family and had a new mortgage and i suddenly could not work anymore
803264 somehow with my wifes support we managed to survive staying together and being close as a family is very important when you have fibromyalgia my oldest daughter also has fibromyalgia and her son justin is part of the band
803265 the music we play is a bit of everything some is blues and jazz and folk and some good old rock n roll i write songs about real life what i have lived and learned
803266 one song that is about my experience with fibro is called
803267 i truly believe that research into fibromyalgia is at a stage where new discoveries are within our grasp sadly with the economic troubles we are all facing today research funding is not keeping pace with the science we badly need to develop
803268 we originally planned a benefit concert at hill auditorium for sept 21 of this year but with the economy the way it is corporate sponsors are a bit more difficult to find so the date will most likely be moved back unless we get a miracle in my world miracles happen often
803269 we will soon be producing a cd which will further help raise funds for research and will have a dozen or so songs on itunes soon that will also benefit research
803270 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking
803271 for one thousand years russia has belonged to such a category

803276 not only was i convinced that i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared that this would become known

803283 i would shop for a gorgeous three panel oriental screen and set it up angled from the linen closet this will give a guest some privacy and also add interest to the entrance and the dining area
803284 why have kitchens descended from the back of the house and below stairs to the front door
803285 civilized living requires keeping your prep areas and household odours away from the eyes and nostrils of guests
803286 this curve will give the entrance some style and draw the eye past the kitchen and into the living room
803287 id also choose a light wood for the rest of the suite as a contrast to the dark slate
803288 it would be fun to have under the sofa a rectangular rug or better yet a square one that is complimentary to the dining room rug
803289 the square and circular forms will play off each other
803290 the scale is perfect for the size of the backyard
803291 because the gazebo and the dining area are opposite each other it gives you two totally different perspectives depending on where youre sitting
803292 if everything was tight up against one another then it would look like you tried to cram too many things into a small backyard
803293 it means your eye doesnt stop it just keeps going and progresses across the lawn which means it gives you visual space
803294 it looks like you have done a lot of work and you dont do a thing with it

803302 the approval of cymbalta is important because it provides physicians and patients with a new treatment option shown to help reduce pain and improve functioning in this difficult to treat disorder
803303 the fda approval of cymbalta for the management of fibromyalgia is another important step in the efforts to ensure that people with fibromyalgia will have the availability of effective medications to help reduce the chronic widespread pain of this life altering disorder

803309 i love plants with height vines like clematis dutchmans pipe and trumpet vine but with our summers being so short they take such a long time to establish themselves
803310 so this year i started thinking about getting height again and being from toronto i just had to look around me to figure it out the developers were simply building up so why didnt i

803319 these are measures designed just to get more money out of people through fines for relatively small scale things
803320 once the ban is introduced it will result in the short term falling off sales and a reduction of revenues
803321 these bans are largely self policing and people will respect the law
803322 it used to be that landlords could decide who comes into their bars and who doesnt and now suddenly that space has been nationalised with new criminal offences for doing things in a place that was formerly private
803323 were adding criminal offences at a fantastic rate in this country this is creeping towards a surveillance society and police state
803324 part of the existing powers of environmental health officers is to gather evidence in scotland and have the similar powers people were very happy with the way the laws were being enforced
803325 ultimately where compliance by consent is not obtained it will be the responsibility of the ehps to
803326 were not proactively seeking out premises to break the ban mainly because we feel there will be widespread compliance in any case
803327 we know other councils are going down a different route but we have a good relationship with our licensees and see no reason for these tactics
803328 local authorities have opened these positions for two years but were worried they will become a permanent fixture using surveillance equipment to monitor other behaviour
803329 councils now have an enormous amount of power and in the last year or so theyve been focusing on undercover operations
803330 i got a letter from hackney council accusing me of not displaying my license correctly and for staying open longer than my license permits which is serious accusation
803331 if you havent breached your license you can ignore this letter
803332 we would anticipate that only the one temporary officer would be involved
803333 i have found the book of the law in the l ord s temple
803334 your officials are doing everything they were assigned to do 17 the money that was collected at the temple of the l ord has been turned over to the supervisors and workmen
803335 go to the temple and speak to the l ord for me and for all the remnant of israel and judah inquire about the words written in the scroll that has been found for the l ord s great anger has been poured out on us because our ancestors have not obeyed the word of the l ord we have not been doing everything this scroll says we must do
803336 at 9 30pm on the night 5 august 2007 we were assaulted by the paramilitary police while walking through the historical center of oaxaca
803337 they loaded us into a vehicle and bent us over in stress position covering our heads for 15 minutes then imprisoned us and locked us up for one hour in a darkroom where we were subjected to insults blows threats and sexual aggression
803338 they made us kneel with our hands on ours heads while they robbed our property money passports and immigration cards
803339 this is our democracy one of no faith and apathy
803340 the flaws in the public security and criminal justice system in mexico currently allow for arbitrary detention torture ill treatment denial of due process unfair trials political interference in the administration of justice and widespread impunity
803341 the poorest and most vulnerable are often victims of these abuses
803342 the result is that whether or not the human rights of mexicans are protected depend on which state they live in
803343 my gosh your face is gray and chalky whats wrong with you

803358 for i tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the pharisees and the teachers of the law you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven
803359 this one sentence has such vivid and amazing imagery it might flow just a little bit better if insert suggestion here
803360 i had this dream but nobody believed that i could make it and at one point i even stopped believing in myself
803361 the hardest thing i have ever done is leave my family i decided to study here in new zealand but i did not realize that i was never going to see my family until i was in the airport that has been the hardest thing i have ever done
803362 i thought that it was going to be really hard for me to find a good job but it was really easy i consider myself really lucky
803363 i always wanted to have the realationship that i had with my mother with my own kids and it has actually happened we all have a very close relationship including my husband and we actually share everything with each other i could not weish for something else i think that everything in my life is perfect just like i wanted
803364 my husband has always been there for me and i know that he will always be i have been in love with him since the first moment i saw him and i know for a fact her has too this is the most perfect relationship i have evern been in and i know that it is going to last forever this man has always been there for me as i have been there for him he is my rock my everything and i admire him but he also admires me i guess that is what makes us successfulas a couple that we admire each other

803366 we are hearing from the launch control center that there has been an anomaly on that vehicle
803367 but i hope spacex keeps trying theyre very competent people
803368 the fact that locog think this is within their rights is ludicrous
803369 if event holders have too many powers sponsorships go up which only large multi nationals can afford
803370 top tier sponsorship is just one part of raising the necessary funds
803371 much of our procurement for goods and services will kick in around 2009 there is a long way to go
803372 once in a lifetime opportunity to transform the lives of people who find themselves excluded from londons booming economy
803373 get a handle on it put it behind you move forward make a new you
803374 and some homeowners are moving in soon its a family friendly community with homeowners who are generally in their late 20s and early 40s
803375 the younger families tend to buy the smaller homes on 30 and 36 foot lots and the 45 foot lot homes tend to skew to a little bit older buyer but they are all family oriented and most buyers have children
803376 we have a clearance sale price of 15 000 off some homes with closings in the late fall of 2008 or early spring of 2009
803377 newmarket wont grow too large because of the greenbelt protecting it it also enjoys the cachet of being just a bit north of aurora but has more affordable homes
803378 if your dog is not leash trained that is something the owner can work on prior to moving
803379 leash training will have them more under control and in condo situations where there is a higher concentration of dogs you want a dog that walks around well with distractions a head halter collar is good for walking a dog because it gives you more control over the pet
803380 anytime you leave say your goodbyes early then ignore your dog for five to 10 minutes
803381 it will minimize the anxiety when you leave similarly when you come home dont make a big fuss wait till your pet settles down and reward them when they are quiet
803382 a dog that is more exercised will be quieter if the dog is in all day get up early and take the dog for an extra long walk that will go a long way to settling your dog when hes at home dogs should be let out every six to eight hours meal feeding once or twice a day gives you better control of their bathroom habits
803383 vocalization is not usually a problem with cats but when cats are stressed they can become destructive with their scratching or they start urinating outside the litter box
803384 if you can set up your furniture in a similar fashion to the way it was in your last house that might alleviate some stress introduce new toys but like dogs belongings from the old home will be comforting
803385 we should get one of those funky scooby doo type vans and just take it on the road
803386 the act is being objected to because of the number of criminal law sanctions against live music
803387 makes no distinction between a piano player and an orchestra or a sound system
803388 i would have had to satisfy nine different regulatory bodies just to host an informal gig it wasnt worth it
803389 the actual experience of licensees going through the new process was often far from the streamlined simplified efficient and less costly process that the act led them to expect
803390 hugely damaging to musicians offering anything that isnt commercially viable
803391 we never claimed that the licensing act would change things overnight
803392 however it has brought many benefits such as more venues being able to put on more than two musicians
803393 venues where people are prepared to pay a substantial sum for tickets are thriving but small scale music shouldnt be a criminal offence
803394 local people having a sing song with a guitar is hardly the same as an organised event the law should be more flexible
803395 the evidence so far does not suggest a widespread negative impact on live music
803396 if this is based on their recent research neither is a reliable measure of the impact of the act on live gigs in small venues
803397 we lobbied long and hard and then we made a conscious decision that weve got to cooperate with the dcms so we took a place on the live music forum where we can actually measure whats going on
803398 there have been winners and losers overall the acts effect on live music has been neutral

803454 aku memberinya kekerasan untuk membuatnya tetap tegar ketika orang orang lain menyerah dan mengasuh keluarganya dengan penderitaan dan kelelahan tanpa mengeluh
803455 aku memberinya kepekaan untuk mencintai anak anaknya dalam setiap keadaan bahkan ketika anaknya bersikap sangat menyakiti hatinya
803456 aku memberinya kekuatan untuk mendukung suaminya dalam kegagalannya dan melengkapi dengan tulang rusuk suaminya untuk melindungi hatinya
803457 aku memberinya kebijaksanaan untuk mengetahui bahwa seorang suami yang baik takkan pernah menyakiti isterinya tetapi kadang menguji kekuatannya dan ketetapan hatinya untuk berada disisi suaminya tanpa ragu
803458 dan akhirnya aku memberinya air mata untuk diteteskan ini adalah khusus miliknya untuk digunakan kapan pun ia butuhkan

803505 selama masa liburanku di italia aku mendatangi orang orang yang tak mempersalahkan diriku tapi media massa yang membuat opini
803506 jika lippi kembali itu karena dia yakin bisa kembali melambungkan impian italia dan prestasi bersejarah seperti mempertahankan gelar piala dunia lippi bisa menanggung tekanan yang dialamatkan ke gli azzurri tapi ronadoni menjadi korban dari situasi yang paradoks sekarang orang yang sama mengatakan kembalinya lippi merupakan kesalahan

803584 with so much gone on defense you replace the entire front seven nothing set at qb you have a difficult schedule this year will even you admit that it might be a bit of a rebuilding year
803585 its tough it is tough assuming he means the schedule im not ready quite to say that because that puts kind of a negative connotation on it im excited about our year actually

803596 the offensive line is probably one of the biggest issues on our football team said the coach who is less concerned about losing his entire front seven on defense because of the likes of
803597 at this time im not counting on him for the season

803602 lyles decision making was much better he played the game much faster just his overall confidence was impressive

803619 lain lagi pengalaman pak mansyur suatu saat pak mansyur kehilangan sepeda motor kesayangannya sepeda motor tersebut dicuri orang di hadapan pak mansyur sendiri saat ia mau berangkat sholat jumat sepeda motor yang sudah dikunci itu ia letakkan di teras rumahnya ketika orang di kampungnya sudah hampir berangkat ke masjid saat itu pula pak mansyur keluar untuk pergi ke masjid tak disangka ada seorang yang tak dikenal masuk lewat pintu pagar kebetulan tidak terkunci langsung saja sepeda motor itu dilarikan oleh orang tak dikenal tersebut pak mansyur berusaha mengejar tapi tak mampu berlari mengejar sepeda motor yang dilarikan dengan kencang itu apalagi saat itu pak mansyur sedang memakai sarung mau berangkat ke masjid maka ia hanya bisa berteriak minta tolong namun apa dikata semua orang laki laki sudah sepi karena semua sedang berada di masjid maka sepeda motor satu satunya yang dimiliki pak mansyur itu pun hilang padahal ia sangat memerlukannya untuk antar jemput sekolah anak anaknya raib bersama sang pencuri yang kabur dengan begitu cepatnya tinggallah pak mansyur yang merana merenung bersedih bahkan bingung apa yang harus dibuatnya ia tidak tahu hari hari setelah kehilangan sepeda motor itu pak mansyur bersama istrinya hanya bisa berdoa dan berdoa bahkan sering ia melelehkan air mata sendirian ketika anak anaknya bertanya dengan apakah mereka berangkat sekolah padahal sepeda motor itu dipakai bergantian untuk mengantar dan menjemput dua anaknya yang sekolah di sekolah dasar dan seorang anaknya yang di sekolah menengah pertama ah sudahlah semua yang sudah terjadi merupakan ketetapan yang tidak bisa diubah lagi

803670 to tackle the teacher shortage and attract and retain quality teachers we need to offer rewarding salary and career structures
803671 establishing a national assessment and classification structure for accomplished teachers is possible based on standards and criteria already being used in various ways across the states
803672 currently there are few options for such teachers other than to move into leadership and administrative roles which take them and their teaching abilities out of the classroom where they are most needed
803673 this proposal from the profession is timely as coag the council of australian governments is developing its national partnership on teacher quality
803674 over the years the death of the mainframe has been predicted many times
803675 ibms priority has always been to understand customers business needs and through continuous innovation support those needs the system z server is the result of such a customer centric approach to solution innovation
803676 thus system z is once again emerging as the leading platform choice by customers for running stable reliable enterprise wide solutions so bringing together two leading system z partners is a natural fit
803677 customers in web 2 0 hpc and emerging cloud deployments across many business segments are looking for competitive advantages that scale out computing can provide
803678 through innovations in server density power efficiency storage management and data center services we are committed to being the company that powers scale out infrastructures
803679 the bubble of interest surrounding project management is about to burst the discipline will always be there but it will not evolve into more than an effective tool in a professionals toolbox
803680 during the past 15 years a continuing trend toward it industrialization has grown in popularity as it services delivered via hardware software and people are becoming repeatable and usable by a wide range of customers and service providers
803681 this is due in part to the commoditization and standardization of technologies in part to virtualization and the rise of service oriented software architectures and most importantly to the dramatic growth in popularity of the internet
803682 a style of computing where massively scalable it related capabilities are provided as a service using internet technologies to multiple external customers
803683 create a new opportunity to shape the relationship between those who use it services and those who sell them
803684 ops mvs is a well established product family it has a significant market share in the mainframe automation space for dealing in operations what were introducing here is a brand new option the switch operations facility that helps to manage the escon and ficon environments at customer sites
803685 its a new mainframe solution for them that helps them manage the storage devices and the network that it is a part of your infrastructure your ports your switches the components of that network as well
803686 it is still a 3270 based screen but the visualization provides a hierarchical view of your escon and ficon infrastructure with this hierarchical view when you choose to issue or automate actions you can see what impact those actions will have or if you have an event that occurs you can simplify the problem analysis and then your impact analysis is typically the next stage
803687 despite economic uncertainty and a more competitive job market there are still talent shortages in certain it specialties such as applications development web development and network administration
803688 employers are struggling to find the most qualified candidates and some are more willing to negotiate higher compensation to get them on board
803689 is it more or less challenging to find qualified candidates for it jobs now compared to 12 months ago
803690 instead of being responsible for monitoring hardware and networks and then fixing problems when they occur the emphasis is now on managing the applications
803691 these ceos are taking highly visible collective action to m itigate the risk that uncertainty over intergovernmental policy presents to their businesses
803692 create a level international playing field for issues such as green house gas emission controls and taxation
803693 although the letter focuses beyond 2012 these ceos are likely to start their preparations now to ensure a competitive advantage during the next decade developing a low carbon economy will be a complex and formidable challenge it leaders should expect the first demand impacts in 2009 but it would be wise to start getting familiar with green it requirements now
803694 as we collected compensation data for our mid year 2008 it salary survey we found that at the end of the first quarter businesses turned off the faucet for it spending
803695 many businesses in response to economic projections slowed down and halted discretionary spending for software and hardware as well as placed hiring requisitions on a slow track
803696 while the forecast remains strong overall a more cautious hiring climate prevails
803697 employers want to ensure business demands support full time staff additions shorter term initiatives are being completed on a project basis in some instances
803698 if unified communications is so great why is it just emerging now what has changed in the past few years
803699 the decline in reported outsourcing contracts can be partially explained by the fact that outsourcing is now business as usual for many enterprises
803700 there is more outsourcing activity but fewer deals on average are reported and this creates the false impression that outsourcing is decreasing
803701 while further tcv erosion may be driven by the irreversible trends of global delivery and it services industrialization as many leading edge organizations move into their second and third generations of it outsourcing they may be looking at deal expansion to include wider application or business initiatives
803702 although these opportunities are likely to evolve from a single provider to a multiple provider engagement in some cases historical ties between provider and recipient may retain the potential for megadeals
803703 many providers are pursuing smaller contract strategies as a consequence of the new market realities new competition and natural market pressures toward commoditization which reduces per unit pricing these strategies are often in the form of pursuit of smaller contracts from larger clients or larger contracts from smaller companies
803704 many clients want to test providers contracting practices capabilities and cultures before moving favored providers into larger contracts or organizations are using smaller doses of outsourcing to delay larger outsourcing adventures
803705 many providers are forced to pursue larger contracts to meet growth expectations despite this pressure providers should continue to evaluate different or at least accommodate go to market and product portfolio strategies for smaller clients
803706 each node is as potent as a complete enterprise grade big iron unix server of just five years ago and the nodes are designed to be combined 14 to each frame times as many frames as youd like
803707 to put this in perspective each drawer node roughly matches the big p690s ibm sold to leading hpc customers earlier in the decade
803708 a single rack of these would qualify as one of the worlds top 500 supercomputers as of the last i e november 2007 top500 listing
803709 the power 575 is also a radical proposition in its relationship to the datacenter
803710 can take 480 volt three phase power directly into the frame and it cools processors directly with chilled water
803711 its no exaggeration to say that a rack capable of efficiently consuming and cooling 75 kilowatts or so to drive hundreds of processor cores terabytes of memory over a terabit of aggregate i o and that then can be easily combined with a lot more of those racks that is a radical design for extreme performance
803712 m any organizations view analytics and the resulting ability to make more profitable decisions as the heart of what they want from information technology
803713 and when they want analysis they want it now understanding a market trend or pricing shift after its happened may be useful for academics or regulators but traders want to see it in real time when they can still make a buck off the shift airlines hotels and other travel hospitality providers want to understand the best pricing strategy while the customer is browsing their web sites or still on the phone when a deal can be struck that optimizes company results not hours later after the customer has moved on executives want superior actions and outcomes not just better information
803714 high performance computing used to be another way of saying technical and scientific computing which immediately excluded 94 3 percent of an enterprise audience
803715 but not so much any more it is increasingly responsible for operating their organizations consolidated computing assets including the infrastructure underlying new product development and manufacture moreover hpc has increasing relevance to the database combing and analytic applications that drive business decisions
803716 the power 575 is part of a new vanguard given the high level of virtualization support seen in the power6 family you could even build a general purpose or network computing infrastructure with power 575 nodes
803717 it would be a radical approach perhaps but a few years ago so would much of the highly virtualized network delivered analytics forward computing now seen as an of course proposition by so much of it
803718 it went from the dishwasher thats the point of origin to the kitchen living room and dining room
803719 we dont know if it was electrical or if there was something else going on behind the dishwasher to cause the fire
803720 i would love to be able to get to the top of that tree
803721 well why dont you nibble on some of my droppings
803722 even though it decision makers clearly recognise the importance of green it solutions such as virtualisation and server consolidation there are always going to be growing pains involved with making a significant change to an organisation
803723 if going green means replacing servers that are already delivering reliable it to an organisation then widespread adoption may take some time
803724 it will be interesting to see how the priorities of government organisations regarding green it may change over time as its value in long term cost savings becomes more clear
803725 the book i refer to most often is probably my own i wrote it partly so i wouldnt have to remember all the stuff ive learned over the years
803726 theres been a copy in the family country home for as long as i can remember stained with every summer fruit available in the northeast
803727 she has some amazing things scattered throughout every book and i always learn something
803728 not as much for the recipes but as a way to think about food theyre anachronistic and that plays really well with all my romantic and escapist fantasies
803729 im not such a cookbook person not at all there was a moment before i began baking 20 years ago that i was a certified cookbook fiend i read them morning noon and night
803730 as you probably have guessed i dont get stains on books but i do get the metaphor
803731 were it in a restaurant kitchen it would almost certainly bring on a raid by the health department
803732 the most stained tattered dog eared and well loved cookbook i own
803733 looking through the pictures in that book convinced me to be a chef
803734 i dont quite have a stained cookbook but i have a go to one that is a constant source of information and passion
803735 these were the books i thumbed through read and reread and cooked my way through either at home or work
803736 the book thats used in culinary school here in france and holds the basic techniques of french cuisine
803737 we must have cooked nearly every recipe nearly 10 times each over the past 20 years i adore her pear clafoutis which my wife loves to make
803738 it was a 22nd birthday gift from my college roommate and beyond being stained it has lost its hard cover
803739 in the bayless house breakfast is the meal that they all eat together
803740 i bought my first copy 15 years ago and discovered many of my grandmothers and mothers recipes corrected refined and perfected though marcellas exquisite bolognese sauce is beyond anything that nanna rose could conceive of
803741 she was writing about great simple ingredients and mediterranean foods when i first started cooking back in the last 70s
803742 it is one of the smallest yet most useful books a g p s of cooking
803743 one time when i worked at campanile i brought it in and nancy silverton said wow i hope someday i see a copy of my book that looks like that
803744 i learned so much from this book and its still a favorite

803986 overall were not seeing any signs of wage growth abating and early indications are that labour input held up reasonably well over the quarter
803987 this doesnt stand in the way of further rate cuts from the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz the focus is now on the deceleration in the economy and particularly given the recent jitters over investment funds its a clear sign that further interest rate cuts are well on the way
803988 the labour market is still tight right here right now for the rbnz the question is where its going to be in 18 months and ive got unemployment rising to 5 per cent

803997 here we have a state government imposing these road changes ahead of a mobility summit which was supposed to discuss precisely these types of measures
803998 it beckons the question why have a mobility summit when you have already made decisions about what is happening in the cbd
803999 if we were to remove them now have the mobility forum and the city of sydney agrees to an extension of the bus lanes and then put those bus lanes back that comes at some great expense

804024 i think its an enormous opportunity and it fits a piece of the jigsaw thats been missing in our welfare reform drive
804025 the difference from the past is that there has been big corporate drives with indigenous employment but weve stopped short of guaranteeing the job
804026 there are large pockets of unemployment in places like blacktown in sydney
804027 this scheme is about getting corporate australia across the full range of industries not just mining but across a full range of industries looking at their employment workforce and saying listen if we set 1 per cent of our workforce aside for indigenous people and we guarantee people that successfully complete courses are placed in our company were just going to make a big inroad in the aboriginal unemployment problem and therefore the poverty problem
804028 the lessons that we would offer would be to go slowly to mentor indigenous people
804029 with every hour per day spent watching baby dvds and videos infants learned six to eight fewer new vocabulary words than babies who never watched the videos these products had the strongest detrimental effect on babies 8 to 16 months old the age at which language skills are starting to form

804051 the eyes are witnesses that the heavens revolve in the space of twenty four hours but certain men either from the love of novelty or to make a display of ingenuity have concluded that the earth moves now it is a want of honesty and decency to assert such notions publicly and the example is pernicious it is the part of a good mind to accept the truth as revealed by god and to acquiesce in it

804070 there are about 5 6 million people between 45 and 65 years of age and less than a million of those have a secure future in terms of their superannuation and their health funding
804071 but also quite a few of them now recognise that superannuation isnt going to provide them the financial platform that they need when they retire
804072 in terms of thinking about other sources of funding to fund old age including health you know some said well well probably rely on the state or potentially on family or indeed personal assets
804073 the traditional approaches to dealing with old age and health care which is basically to try and support people in their homes but then move them into various institutions just wont work anymore
804074 and then of course youve got the ever increasing costs of health care and the fact that people are living longer and are therefore going to need more serious care for much longer
804075 none of that i think has been adequately addressed and to be honest the healthcare system is struggling even today to manage todays issues let alone thinking 20 years ahead

804078 we had 13 specific audits in qantas engineering last year so we just see this as more of them casa doing their job which is to be the regulator
804079 what theyre doing i think is coming in and doing their job which is to make sure people have utter confidence in the safety of qantas but also the probity of the regulatory system
804080 casa audited qantas generally and qantas engineering specifically a great deal
804081 obviously events like manila where we had the aircraft depressurise they were an entirely different kind of a normal run of business things that are being reported almost daily
804082 firstly our aircraft travel around the globe how you avoid having them touched by foreign hands while you do that is a mystery to me
804083 but the second thing we have 7000 engineers employed in australia two thousand of those are doing heavy maintenance
804084 so that means the vast majority and i mean the vast majority of our work is actually done here in australia and has been for many many years and will continue to be
804085 qantas safety standards are so high and so well recognised that when we do have an accident like the other day with ojk the aircraft in manila its big news and were not afraid of the scrutiny
804086 to tackle the teacher shortage and attract and retain quality teachers we need to offer rewarding salary and career structures
804087 establishing a national assessment and classification structure for accomplished teachers is possible based on standards and criteria already being used in various ways across the states
804088 currently there are few options for such teachers other than to move into leadership and administrative roles which take them and their teaching abilities out of the classroom where they are most needed
804089 this proposal from the profession is timely as coag the council of australian governments is developing its national partnership on teacher quality
804090 let me be very clear on this we require the different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and i am adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions
804091 ioc officials negotiated with the chinese so that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
804092 our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
804093 when beijing was awarded the games the ioc required it to provide media with the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games the ioc required this and this is what bocog beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad has said it will deliver

804114 following the death of ben mullany at morriston hospital earlier today south wales police is continuing to support the families at this most difficult time

804136 what used to be so exciting and promising about creating art has come to a difficult and painful crawl
804137 here is another perspective on wasting a lot of paint i have come across an exercise in a buddhist magazine with the following instructions use oil paint and paint while being mindful and present when you feel the image is right or dine appreciate it and take turpentine and wipe it away begin again and do this process repeatedly this develops an experience of detachment and it eventually creates a space where your image making comes from a deeper source aviva gold refers to this as painting from the source it also reminds me of drawing from the right side of the brain sometimes i feel like i stand in my own way and find these exercises helpful
804138 you are right on the money about what happened to me after school
804139 emerge with an idea of what art making should mean
804140 fundamentally i feel that art is about communication and i am particularly interested in the first signs of the creative impulse in ancient humans as a matter of fact it was during a search for ancient art that i came across your site and had to laugh when i realized what you meant by ancient artist what a relief to find someone else like me dont get me wrong i love my young artist friends but the experience just isnt the same i would agree that the act of creating grounds us or connects us to a higher spiritual experience as a visual person the act of creating images is where i can uniquely express myself and my experience when that expression feels difficult it is a sign that my inner and outer world are not aligned

804145 why not offer these drops in the form of a vpc image with the build not only would this give the community a safe way to work with the builds it would also let you get up and running in 2 minutes instead of the 20 40 it takes to get a preview installed
804146 i agree that vpc images would be a lot more compelling unfortunately there are lots of issues with distributing vpc images
804147 oh yeah that knew about that thats fixed in the next beta
804148 well be releasing another community technology preview in a few weeks
804149 once weve been putting builds out frequently think weekly or every day for a while there will be less confusion about which ones have been through comprehensive testing many people will learn to ignore most and look for the beta indicator of quality while bleeding edge customers have the option of being more involved
804150 community drops are about getting feedback in time to address it
804151 part of the problem is that the information is very hard to digest e g it comes out as 83 of the tests passed but what you really want to know is that you cant open a project or debug because there are significant failures in those areas i e the test results can look good when any real user would say its broken

804189 consider what happens when a company announces impending layoffs but does not specify which people will lose their jobs in these situations people will do almost anything to save their jobs and avoid the pain of such loss how else can you explain the kinds of leaps in productivity we see after a company makes such an announcement but another dynamic emerges when a company announces that entire divisions will close the people affected those who cannot escape the loss do the unthinkable they scream at their bosses or perform other acts of aggression instead of acting rationally they flame out in a panic to survive

804571 come on then where have we got to go for this
804572 ive got to be able to get this connection to someone who was connected to or involved in a union
804573 ah right so youd understand it as arthur walter not arthur walker
804574 when we did a loft conversion it was all propped up
804575 it was all propped up thats been since he passed over
804576 yes that was the reason why we did it because he came to live with us
804577 ah right okay because hes just talking about that memory here of a ceiling just being propped up
804578 he must have been getting or knowing that he was getting frailer or more ill
804579 at that point because im just getting this feeling from him the guy was pretty brave in all this he knew he was on his way out he knew that he was in his final time
804580 he moved in with you he must have been like really sick was he dying still brave guy i bet should we change the subject now only you look a bit emotional
804581 so can you understand why arthur is so indignant about this idea that a stairlift is not the answer
804582 he lived in a townhouse and he couldnt get up the stairs
804583 right and would you please understand that as you came up the stairs there was a turn in the stairs that came up onto a landing with a balustrade
804584 and it had a kitchen with a sink and cupboards
804585 i mean he would have rather have crawled up the stairs than have of these stairlifts put in for him that was the final defeat
804586 so can i just come to you are you son or son in law
804587 thank you i felt that this is what i wanted im just going to have cut the rest of the family out for the moment because hes pulling me over to you hes asking me to say to you he would like to thank you for saving him from embarrassment
804588 like erm there are things you did for him that he wouldnt have liked the ladies to have done
804589 erm thank you sir hes just saying you saved me the indignity
804590 hes also saying the bed became a problem but we sort of managed
804591 yeah it did become a problem but we sort of managed
804592 okay and alright and it was a good job that we could actually do it with some humour
804593 okay hes also asking it to be known within the family that in his passing he has met up with catherine or kathleen
804594 right okay alright which among many other things was one of his greatest wishes
804595 that he would meet with his mother catherine or kathleen
804596 can you understand why hes showing me please and i feel as though its got to be memorable in some way a huge jar of marmite
804597 right i know that in this that he wants to send his love to someone where theres this connection to this big jar of marmite
804598 oh right okay i can see him quite defiantly in my mind standing there saying now listen doesnt matter whether we like him or not
804599 and i have to actually come over and actually say look when you first come on the scene he didnt actually wasnt sure whether he liked you or not
804600 no every time i walked into the room he walked out
804601 yeah okay so hes saying no come on lets learn from experience here it doesnt matter whether we like him or not
804602 as much as he wants to send his love to you my love and he really does and also to his grandchildren and everything its his son in law mostly that he wanted to talk to today just to say i just need to thank you or just saving me from so much embarrassment and so many indignities
804603 brad bullying seems to be the only tactic other than outright lying and twisting of words that the anti vaccinationists seem to have going for them
804604 like any medical intervention vaccination carries some risk but the risk is so small compared to the great benefit of immunity from life threatening diseases that for people without contraindications vaccination is the best choice
804605 vaccines as presently formulated and administered can cause harm to children they certainly can prevent illness but must be used judiciously with careful evaluation of risks and benefits

804620 nothing could undermine the credibility of the intelligent design crowd faster than this dishonest venal attempt to make an end run around the legitimate scientific vetting process
804621 this is probably one of the worst movies ive seen last year
804622 fortunately my boyfriend and i were the only people in the theaters which allowed us to yell at the screen freely
804623 90 minutes of your life you will never get back
804624 it merely exposes intelligent design advocates as the fundamentalist nutcases that they really are
804625 i am offended as a biologist a christian and a human
804626 i sat for an interminable period of time in stunned silence
804627 i gave it one star because the dvd might serve as a pretty good coaster
804628 i should have known better when the expelled theater consisted only of me my girlfriend and my friend on a busy saturday night well in all fairness there was another couple who walked out in the first 20 minutes no doubt to get their money back and salvage the rest of their evening
804629 if film technology had existed at the time of copernicus then the catholic church would have made a movie similar to expelled to convince people the sun revolves around the earth

804637 if officials wanted to introduce some or all aspects of shariah law into the uk for muslims only would you support their move
804638 do you think shariah law should be introduced into the uk it may seem like wordplay but wordplay is critically important in understanding results from polls like this and how they can be misinterpreted
804639 do not think men and women are equal in the eyes of allah
804640 an article the other day saying we should be kinder to muslims and this is what they want to do to us
804641 yet its only us who can be acused of being racist our country is going to erupt one of these days
804642 im sure 100 of britons if you asked them would prefer these people to be deported
804643 such students when firmly identified must be immediately expelled and sent back to their home countries
804644 this tells us what we already know islam is not compatible with democracy yet the government allows this hate to be spread there should be no muslim unions at university or any other institution
804645 the evidence is all around us that islam is in conflict with everything that can regarded as civilised
804646 goody at last they start to show their true colours wake up the vipers are in the nursery
804647 what are you going to do about this to make indigenous population safe from muslim extremists
804648 why cant we do as idi amin did and deport all who think that way
804649 ive been in the game for four no hang on what date is it the 31st nearly five months and im more than confident in my ability to lead us out against the assorted mystics evangelists conspiracy theorists quacks and celebrity spokespeople even jenny mccarthy
804650 were going to use logic and reason plain and simple
804651 aha thats an appeal to popularity which is a logical fallacy i win

804661 doctor spurt ha i wont ask what your specialty is
804662 well ive been making life difficult for my opponent coach
804663 specifically one roger coghill who thinks mobile phone masts cause well basically everything from cancer to suicide
804664 not only does roger coghill sound like hes terrible at science it also appears that hes more concerned about generating publicity for his commercial enterprises than he is about the safety of the children hes daring people to kill god i wish he could somehow see my words in writing right now anyway good work spurt next ah paul hutchinson
804665 well your conventional engineer would be yes but these are a sort of not only are they afraid of mobile phones but they also want to frankly its
804666 its the new team kit coach i had it specially made its aerodynamic
804667 well yes coach on the subject of mobile phones ive been taking on a minor infestation of woo at the university of pittsburgh cancer institute theyve been making really irresponsible claims about mobile phones but dont worry i put them in their place they look really stupid now
804668 right well good work just sit there and try not to
804669 yes coach i think it may be a sort of speciation event possibly the result of a quack interbreeding with a clown
804670 interesting now as you know one of our biggest competitors here are team spirit now some of their members making claims about angels may be a few skeptics short of a carnival nice job youve done debunking their claims about scientific proof but didnt that book come out ten years ago

804676 good work now techskeptic i gather you managed to defeat the free energy team before they even arrived here in beijing
804677 last we heard they were somewhere off the falkland islands
804678 morning coach im up against team cam theyve been doing experiments on rats
804679 theyre waving their hands at rats to see if it cures them what kind of idiots funded this crap
804680 its worse than we thought well stay strong now skeptico youre last and i gather youve been taking a look at our overall team strategy
804681 really nice place that im keen on france have you
804682 no provenance you know a things origin and the history of its subsequent owners it seems that most of the time you can distinguish woo from genuine research just by understanding its provenance its surprisingly simple
804683 if only that sort of insight was taught in our schools
804684 555 of all the 625 glaciers under observation by the world glacier monitoring service in zurich switzerland have been growing since 1980
804685 since 1980 there has been an advance of more than 55 of the 625 mountain glaciers under observation by the world glacier monitoring group in zurich
804686 since 1980 there has been an advance of more than 55 of the 625 mountain glaciers under observation by the world glacier monitoring group in zurich
804687 lyndon larouche is the american demagogue who in 1989 received a 15 year sentence for conspiracy mail fraud and tax code violations he has claimed that the british royal family is running an international drugs syndicate that henry kissinger is a communist agent that the british government is controlled by jewish bankers and that modern science is a conspiracy against human potential
804688 the world glacier monitoring service in zurich switzerland in a paper published in science in 1989 noted that between 1926 and 1960 more than 70 percent of 625 mountain glaciers in the mid latitude united states soviet union iceland switzerland austria and italy were retreating after 1980 however 55 percent of these same glaciers were advancing
804689 they were then reproduced by the appropriately named junkscience com by the cooler heads coalition the us national centre for public policy research and countless others they have even found their way into the washington post
804690 between 1960 and 1980 on the basis of data for about 400 to 450 glaciers observed each year advancing glaciers are shown to have increased from about 6 of observed glaciers to 55 during the 1960 to 1980 period on the basis of data for about 50 glaciers observed each year annual mass balance is shown to be on the average positive for about 57 of observed glaciers in the european alps and for 40 of observed glaciers in the other monitored areas of the world

804714 i think what were trying to avoid saying is were not going to guarantee you there will never be another cut or that no one will ever lose their job
804715 but it is certainly our intention to get it all out of the way right now and move on with some focus and clarity

804762 theyre so easily spooked the labor government have such a lack of confidence in themselves
804763 its quite bizarre that theyre reacting in this way theyre getting so excited and so hysterical
804764 peter costello made clear that hes not available for the leadership and that remains the case he did that the day after the election
804765 he flagged he was thinking about the next phase of his professional life that he would do that with his family and im sure thats what hes doing
804766 its an important part of an opposition leaders role as the alternative prime minister to be in touch with global economic events
804767 it was tony abbott getting lathered up yesterday it was sickening
804768 were all publicly saying what a terrific bloke he is we love him we want him
804769 the problem is theyre completely out of touch with the australian population so in the end it doesnt matter whether its peter costello brendan nelson malcolm turnbull or even tony abbott

804771 we had 13 specific audits in qantas engineering last year so we just see this as more of them casa doing their job which is to be the regulator
804772 what theyre doing i think is coming in and doing their job which is to make sure people have utter confidence in the safety of qantas but also the probity of the regulatory system
804773 casa audited qantas generally and qantas engineering specifically a great deal
804774 obviously events like manila where we had the aircraft depressurise they were an entirely different kind of a normal run of business things that are being reported almost daily
804775 firstly our aircraft travel around the globe how you avoid having them touched by foreign hands while you do that is a mystery to me
804776 but the second thing we have 7000 engineers employed in australia two thousand of those are doing heavy maintenance
804777 so that means the vast majority and i mean the vast majority of our work is actually done here in australia and has been for many many years and will continue to be
804778 qantas safety standards are so high and so well recognised that when we do have an accident like the other day with ojk the aircraft in manila its big news and were not afraid of the scrutiny
804779 as a prosecutor ive learned one thing we dont have a problem with too many guns in this state we have a problem with too many criminals walking the streets willing to use the guns
804780 if i do have the opportunity if you see fit to elect me as attorney general i will walk into that office with the same enthusiasm for restoring the public trust there
804781 you look at yourself in the mirror every day and thats the best source of fighting crime
804782 the governor and i and other state leaders were very forceful in urging him to resign and threatening impeachment and other measures if he did not
804783 i think most people are unaware that any role that mr cordray may have initially had but it sounds now like hes trying to take credit for having forced mr dann out of office
804784 here it is in a very short period of time both major parties have had huge scandals and made a complete mess out of the attorney generals office issue with coingate issues with marc dann

804786 well karmas going to turn around and bite her in the ass and then shell regret it
804787 if i am able to remain unattached to results i am happy it is when i am so attached to a certain outcome that i suffer i know that i can manifest all the goals and dreams that ive been given by my higher aspects if i can let go of my attachments particularly my attachment to time time makes me feel i am behind or not doing enough it is only when i measure my goals against time that i grow impatient i will begin to know that time does not matter ive got eternity after all the essence of me has all the time in the world plus infinity there is really no need for hurry that is only the ego the part of me who is attached to manifesting while in this particular lifetime the personality self wants credit for having achieved these things the higher self knows that it doesnt matter which incarnation does what all will be completed eventually the real creation has already happened it only remains to manifest it here on earth even if it never manifested it has ever been created these creations cannot be taken from my essence experience by any power
804788 i release this matter to godforce for the highest level of transmutation and manifestation i give this matter over to you great spirit i release i surrender
804789 but i know i can do it better if i do this say that and show every possible angle of awareness of the subject
804790 truly i say to you whoever does not receive the kingdom of god like a child will not enter it at all

804798 these really dangerous fats are in everyday foods that people eat and particularly in junk and processed foods
804799 trans fats offer no nutritional value whatsoever and indeed are linked to serious health issues
804800 we believe the time to act on trans fats is now
804801 i think its incredibly important especially for young designers to be closely connected to their means of production both as a business necessity and as a moral obligation
804802 be surrounded by the creative energy that students generally give off
804803 the cursory examinations of a sea captain would never discover them but transferred from his hand to the penetrating eye of a jay the diamonds stand confessed at once
804804 will not only render his communications less exposed to detection but relieve the fears of such persons as may be entrusted in its conveyance
804805 on the blank leaves of a pamphlet a common pocket book or on the blank leaves at each end of registers almanacs or any publication or book of small value
804806 a much better way is to write a letter in the tory stile with some mixture of family matters and between the lines and on the remaining part of the sheet communicate with the stain the intended intelligence
804807 the sa government has been leading the way nationally to seek action on trans fats
804808 at the next meeting of national food and health ministers i will be raising the issue again with a view to seeking a national approach to banning or controlling these fats
804809 i also call on food manufacturers and restaurants to cut trans fats or label their menu and products if they use trans fats so consumers know exactly what they are eating
804810 really hopeful of support at a national level on this really important issue
804811 we are pushing for mandatory labelling and were also looking at encouraging the food industry to remove trans fats
804812 banning them is not going to be a bad outcome but its probably not the most effective move
804813 there are other things we could look at like better labelling looking more at saturated fats and encouraging food suppliers to use polyunsaturated and mono unsaturated fats
804814 but it is really the saturated fats we need to concentrate on
804815 trans fats are bad but so are saturated fats and saturated fats are much more prevalent
804816 i can understand the concern with trans fats and i can understand why they think its a good health thing to do or a good political thing to do or both
804817 ive never felt ive been valued by anyone im just a waste of space that everyone ignores like a ghost without a home
804818 you said i killed you haunt me then be with me always drive me mad only do not leave me in this abyss where i cannot find you i cannot live without my life without my soul

804821 the breadth of performance sea kayaking is fairly astounding this video should be in your library
804822 this video hits the mark quite neatly anyone watching this could not fail to pick up the most important points of long boat handling navigation skills and some basic rescues
804823 if you could have only one video about sea kayaking this would be a very good choice
804824 breadth depth and details make this video demand more than a one time survey a comprehensive sea kayaking instructional textbook
804825 we bought one for rental but discovered people want to own it so now we sell lots of them
804826 if you are serious about learning to sea kayak the video is well worth the price

804858 obviously im playing the other way but its a play ive made so many times i just didnt come up with it this time
804859 i know its a bright sky and all that stuff but its a play ive made before today i didnt make it
804860 it was big especially because i didnt come through earlier in the game
804861 i was beating myself up a little i thought i missed a couple pitches i just wanted one more shot and i got it in the eighth
804862 hes gotta leak over to cover the bag there and he got caught in between
804863 he tried to make a tough pick but it was an in between hop

804902 the court gave us until sunday and if were not able to serve him the matter is still in front of the court on tuesday
804903 i didnt talk to him for long i just wanted to gauge from him if this is what he wants to do
804904 and he assured me that he wants out of there and wants to come and test himself in rugby union
804905 well just keep him busy on what he needs to learn here and that he enjoys his time here
804906 they say class is permanent and you can tell hes got that
804907 so i dont think itll be hard for him at all
804908 tana just wanted me to know what the situation was that he was talking to sonnys agent
804909 my primary objective was to try to keep sonny in our game
804910 i made it very clear to tana in terms of the plans i had for sonny to keep him in our game not just for the 2008 world cup but to grow league in new zealand over the next two to three years
804911 theres no way my client would be induced to break his current agreement
804912 but once hes off contract at the end of next year my advice would be for him to carefully consider any potential switch to rugby given the money on offer
804913 he played rugby at high school knows the game and would be ideally suited at either at five eighth or full back
804914 i said a week ago if he plays rugby union the door would be closed if he tried to come back

804920 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
804921 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed

804953 there are about 5 6 million people between 45 and 65 years of age and less than a million of those have a secure future in terms of their superannuation and their health funding
804954 but also quite a few of them now recognise that superannuation isnt going to provide them the financial platform that they need when they retire
804955 in terms of thinking about other sources of funding to fund old age including health you know some said well well probably rely on the state or potentially on family or indeed personal assets
804956 the traditional approaches to dealing with old age and health care which is basically to try and support people in their homes but then move them into various institutions just wont work anymore
804957 and then of course youve got the ever increasing costs of health care and the fact that people are living longer and are therefore going to need more serious care for much longer
804958 none of that i think has been adequately addressed and to be honest the healthcare system is struggling even today to manage todays issues let alone thinking 20 years ahead

804992 so it was quite amusing to everyone at work that i had been scammed on the internet
804993 the important point im making by talking about this is that this was a bloody good scam
804994 we realise and understand that the ioc are looking to shut down and take further action on that website
804995 but we at the australian olympic committee of course have encouraged everyone all our shadow team members everybody thats part of the olympic family and advertised it very very widely that cosport are our official ticket agent and encouraged all enquiries and everybody to go that way

805032 one of a small number of threats that can hold our society at risk of catastrophic consequences
805033 has the capability to produce significant damage to critical infrastructures that support the fabric of u s society and the ability of the united states and western nations to project influence and military power
805034 several potential adversaries have the capability to attack the united states with a high altitude nuclear weapon generated electromagnetic pulse and others appear to be pursuing efforts to obtain that capability
805035 a determined adversary can achieve emp attack capability without having a high level of sophistication
805036 for example an adversary would not have to have long range ballistic missiles to conduct an emp attack against the united states such an attack could be launched from a freighter off the u s coast using a short or medium range missile to loft a nuclear warhead to high altitude
805037 united nations investigators recently found that the design for an advanced nuclear weapon miniaturized to fit on ballistic missiles currently in the inventory of iran north korea and other potentially hostile states was in the possession of swiss criminals affiliated with the a q khan nuclear smuggling network
805038 the impact would be far worse than on a country less advanced technologically

805112 the justice department twisted the law and in some cases ignored it altogether in order to permit interrogators to use barbaric methods that the u s once prosecuted as war crimes
805113 specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering
805114 classified august 2002 department of justice doj opinion stating that redacted interrogation techniques including the waterboard do not violate the torture statute
805115 a contemporaneous record shall be created setting forth the nature and duration of each technique employed
805116 while the documents released today do provide more information about the development and implementation of the bush administrations torture policies even a cursory glance at the documents shows that the administration continues to use national security as a shield to protect government officials from embarrassment criticism and possible criminal prosecution

805133 we identified this microsoft technology called pastry we saw it as the best peer to peer technology on the market for our purposes
805134 when we mentioned this to ip ventures they said it was something they were looking to bring out of the microsoft research lab in cambridge to have developed by a third party so a marriage was made in heaven for us there we stated our interest finished our funding run and then didnt hear anything for a while then in june 2006 the deal came through where we acquired the intellectual property rights to three core applications that leverage the pastry foundation
805135 this agreement is more than a transfer of technology it is the beginning of new business relationship with skinkers that will yield new innovations for the european and global market
805136 since that investment was made in skinkers a business within skinkers has emerged called livestation skinkers main business is the provision of an enterprise software solution for large scale communications applications within the enterprise the nascent livestation business based on the first implementation of the original microsoft research work is what were focusing on for live television on the pc and our relationship with microsoft spans both businesses because one was spawned from the other
805137 the relationship with microsoft and obviously ip ventures has been critical we have huge support from both ip ventures and from the cambridge lab particularly in the form of introductions
805138 weve managed to get into a number of the product groups and really get to meet the right people
805139 this ground breaking technology will allow broadcasters to reach a virtually unlimited number of people while at their computers livestation is going to change the way people access linear television thanks to its ease of use and quality of the experience
805140 with livestation were trying to create a compelling offering for the global news citizen with a world beating technology that is hard to replicate on the skinkers side of the business were innovating within the communications marketplace i dont think anyone has come up with a solution on how an enterprise connects people with information in a multi channel world with email overload now being a huge problem how do you connect people and systems with what we call shouldknow information how do you ensure that no matter what device you are on or where you are you will receive important information with acknowledgement for audit trails compliance corporate governance etc

805148 dealing with aids now will require a long term response
805149 we are very worried about the wrong idea that we should stop fueling funds for hiv aids
805150 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health
805151 we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia

805164 fue asnar elegido por los militantes es leg timo asnar
805165 la crisis estara olvidada en un par de meses y si no al tiempo
805166 un pepero manifestando la ilegitimidad de aznar pues recordemos que aznar no fue elegido por los militantes sino que fue elegido en un congreso igual al que el pp va a celebrar en junio
805167 a mi me parece que bastante bi n est aguantando el gobierno
805168 sobretodo si lo consegu a gracias a la incertidumbre de una crisis inmobiliaria de la cual ese mismo partido era y es el m ximo responsable
805169 solo de pensar en lo que estar a haciendo ahora mismo el pp en caso de haber ganado las elecciones se me ponen los pelos de punta
805170 pues much simas felicidades lorenzo de euroabia las cosas han salido justo como deseabas
805171 no dices m s que tonter as y mentiras lorenzo durante los ltimos a os la evoluci n del precio de la vivienda pas del 17 por ciento anual hasta el menos cinco por ciento anual
805172 pero si me guardas el secreto admitir que por entonces incluso habr a vendido mi alma al diablo para impedir que el pp ganara las elecciones
805173 o sea que admites que mentiste con tal de que el pp no ganara
805174 quien ha intentado inflar la burbuja hasta el ultimo minuto
805175 que no te traicione el subconsciente de los deseos lorenzo esto es lo que tu querr as ver la burbuja no ha reventado
805176 chale un vistazo al mercado norteamericano aunque supongo que esto ya lo sabes
805177 las pol ticas neoliberales que desarroll desde ese organismo provocaran la crisis financiera y alimentaria
805178 ser a una irrespponsabilidad que la caida de precios fuera brusca y traum tica
805179 vaaaale lorenzo acepto pulpo como animal de compa a y ll vate el escatergoris
805180 la mayor parte del mercado de la vivienda se encuentra en manos privadas ser a una irrespponsabilidad que la caida de precios fuera brusca y traum tica la gente ha confiado en el gobierno socialista antes que en los in tiles papanatas del partido popular
805181 conoces a alguien que le haga gracia que su piso pierda valor en el mercado
805182 si no se pueden construir 900 000 viviendas como en la poca del pp pues no se puede
805183 no digas tonter as todo el mundo sabe a quienes favorecen los peperos y a quienes perjudican
805184 hay que beneficiar a unos pero sin perjudicar a otros
805185 por eso para llevar a cabo este menester la gente ha confiado en el gobierno socialista antes que en los in tiles papanatas del partido popular
805186 quien miraba para el otro lado estos cuatro a os mientras la burbuja tomaba proporciones peligrosas
805187 pero si me guardas el secreto admitir que por entonces incluso habr a vendido mi alma al diablo para impedir que el pp ganara las elecciones
805188 hac a tiempo que no te ve a sacudir tantas hostias en tan poco tiempo ruby veo que no has perdido la forma ni el instinto porque los rivales no han aguantado demasiado ha sido un gustazo
805189 pues en t rminos absolutos siguen aumentando los afiliados a la seguridad social este mes se ha vuelto a batir el r cord hist rico
805190 vamos a ver el idiota de lorenzo se cree nostradamus pero lo cierto es que ni siquiera ahora se sabe cual cual ser el alcance y el tipo de crisis en la que estamos enfrascados
805191 efectivamente el dato de hace un mes no era el r cord absoluto
805192 por ultimo queria decirle que vuelve vd a mostrar su absoluta ignorancia al tomar los datos de creacion de empleo sin des estacionalizar no vamos a pedir peras al olmo
805193 pero mira que eres zote abril del 2008 es r cord absoluto de afiliados 21 mil m s que el abril del a o anterior
805194 veo que esta muy elocuente el tal lorenzo de enbabia pero sigue sin decir ni p o respecto a la crisis en eeuu irlanda y gran breta a
805195 y porque me tuve que ir a dormir que si no
805196 pero que borrico eres lorenzo la afiliaci n a la seguridad se establece con las medias mensuales
805197 vamos que el miserable ten a la certeza de que suceder a porque sabe perfectamente que el liberalismo econ mico es una puta mierda
805198 es que encima es un nacionalista espa ol de tomo y lomo
805199 e efectivamente y pese a la coyuntura negativa de la econom a internacional en espa a no solo no se destruye empleo sino que se siguen creando nuevos en cifras netas
805200 el paro registrado aument en abril en 37 542 personas un mes en el que hist ricamente suele retroceder en unas 50 000 por ello la cifra desestacionalizada la que importa para ver la tendencia da un aumento de 92 500 el distinto calendario de la semana santa distorsiona este dato pero si hacemos la media de marzo y abril para evitar este sesgo obtenemos un aumento mensual de unos 50 000 parados que supone un ritmo anualizado multiplicado por 12 de 600 000 esto supondr a que se est destruyendo empleo efectivamente otro indicador vino a corroborar esta conclusi n el de afiliados a la seguridad social haciendo tambi n la media de marzo y abril se ha producido una p rdida de afiliados en datos desestacionalizados de unos 25 500 por mes m s de 300 000 en t rminos anualizados
805201 por cierto una pregunta informal solo para pasar el rato qu tal la crisis por irlanda
805202 en abril de 2008 hubo 19 251 454 afiliados a la seguridad social cuando justo un a o antes eran 19 230 480
805203 cuando se alcancen los 20 millones de afiliados seguramente este mismo a o
805204 suga no hace falta que te rebajes a contestarle es mejor pasar de l
805205 presumes de que en el blog de prevost ya anticipasteis el paro y el par n de la econom a jojojojojo es normal en ese blog soltabais cada d a tantas trolas que alguna ten ais que acertar
805206 es mejor pasar de l y a principios del a o que viene restregarle los datos econ micos
805207 el ritmo de generacion de empleo esta cayendo en picado 0
805208 no se da cuenta que un incremento de 21 000 afiliaciones en un a o es una birria
805209 cuando se alcancen los 20 millones de afiliados seguramente este mismo a o
805210 franco tirador me podr as decir que significa eso de casi hermano de anacreonte
805211 tenemos que alcanzar esta paz por nuestros pueblos palestino e israel
805212 evitar peligros m s graves que nos amenazan especialmente por parte de los dirigentes iran es
805213 en definitiva qu paranoia parece mas justificada a simple vista la que mediatiza a la rep blica laicoteocr tica de israel y otros intereses paralelos o la que condiciona a la rep blica isl mica de ir n
805214 ludwig dijo me conformar a con que obama fuera el pr ximo presidente de eeuu donde un gobierno de izquierdas es actualmente inpensable
805215 armas de destrucci n masiva era mentira o sigues como aznar pensando que no y que saddam apoyaba a al qaeda tambi n era mentira o no
805216 la retirad ade irak no va a significar ningun cambio significativo en la politica exterior americana y en mi opini n obama intentar lelvar acabo pol ticas imperialistas mejor vistas y que no intervenga el ejercito a gran escala como en irak como kennedy
805217 dije yo creo que obama es un hombre de paja como todos los presidentes americanos bush lo era de las multinacionales del petr leo
805218 la burgues a americana no dejar jam s que el poder pol tico modifique la pol tica exterior
805219 franco tirador creo que has expresado muy bien los argumentos sin embargo desde el marxismo la lucha siempre ha sido de ndole social m s que propiamente econ mica pues el marxismo como doctrina econ mica ha fracasado m s all de la utop a de hecho todos los movimientos pol ticos del sxx son la consecuencia de la aparici n en el xix del burguesismo como clase social ascendente desde dostoievsky hasta herman hess y por supuesto incluyendo a nietze
805220 fueron los propios burgueses como marx quienes despreciaron el conformismo inherente a esa clase social como autocr tica contra lo que en realidad era y sigue siendo el precedente m s obvio del motor de cambio social en la era moderna nada m s y nada menos que una aut ntica clase media heredera directa con sus vicios y virtudes de los antiguos comerciantes y prosfesionales liberales de la edad media clase herm tica entre la ultra minoritaria aristocracia e iglesia o la inmensa chusma de vasallos esclavos en la pr ctica
805221 de hecho mucha gente acusa a karl marx de antisemita siendo el mismo jud o cuando en realidad para el propio marx como hombre de su tiempo deb a considerar jud o como un sin nimo id ntico de burgu s
805222 ya que veo que estas tan dado a la iron a me parto oiga puestos a ser jocosos te dir que como francotirador vales muy poco por que fallas siempre el tiro
805223 en espa a los partidos pol ticos estan financiados por ellos mismos los dirigen directamente los ciudadanos no hay ningun interes empresarial ni en el pp ni en el psoe
805224 dicho esto todo lo de osama bin ladem est contestado
805225 el racismo no se puede explicar asi y quedarse tan tranquilo hay que remontarse a la guerra civil analizar las causas y consecuencias del conflicto el racismo tiene su base en la competencia por lso puestos de trabajo en el sur con la clase obrea blanca pobre que vio que de la noche a la ma ana aparecieron millones de negros bajando los salarios y creando mano de obra barata
805226 a lo que me refer a y creo que est bastante claro es que eeuu no dejar de realizar acciones imperialistas que demande la burgues a puesto que tienen intereses comerciales petroleo caucho
805227 y que ningun presidente va a poder pararlo puesto que si estan ahi es gracias al apoyo de la burgues a multinacionales
805228 es increible tu analisis se basa siempre en un enfurru amiento y un pataleo constante si ocurre eso es por algo no por que los americanos sean malvados y en europa seamos angelitos
805229 suga dijo franco tirador creo que has expresado muy bien los argumentos sin embargo desde el marxismo la lucha siempre ha sido de ndole social m s que propiamente econ mica pues el marxismo como doctrina econ mica ha fracasado m s all de la utop a
805230 apesiona la musica americana el rock de lso 60 y 70
805231 en espa a los partidos pol ticos estan financiados por ellos mismos los dirigen directamente los ciudadanos no hay ningun interes empresarial ni en el pp ni en el psoe
805232 dicho esto todo lo de osama bin ladem est contestado
805233 a la que llegaron por m ritos propios con el capitalismo salvaje y el marxismo econ mico puro
805234 en eeuu las relacciones empresariales estan mucho mas a la vista y son mucho mas descaradas por decirlo de algun modo debido a la potencia de su burgues a y su poder imperial
805235 pd ya he dicho que soy trotskista y por tanto que creo en el estado obrero y no en el estado burocr tico asi que tu
805236 pd ya he dicho que soy trotskista y por tanto que creo en el estado obrero
805237 no se si sabeis que el modelo leninista troskista jam s se aplic en ning n sitio
805238 es una imbecilidad odiar a una civilizaci n entera de hecho odiar simplemente es una imbecilidad demuestra falta de juicio y madurez y que lo diga yo que tengo 19 a os
805239 te molesta que escuche the doors iron butterfly o mc5 por ejemplo
805240 si intentas ir por ahi para descalificarme bien pero caes demasiado bajo dentro de poco me llamaras hijo de puta o algo as a lo mejor as crees que tienes mas raz n
805241 como ver s no vivo tan bien como amancio ortega o bot n y estos le sacan bastante distancia a la aristocracia francesa del xix
805242 por otra parte obrero es un t rmino casi tan anacr nico como burgu s de hecho es bastante insultante comparar al agricultor moderno por poner un ejemplo extremo conduciendo su magn fico tractor con aire acondicionado con los ni os trabajando en condiciones deplorables desde los seis a os por supuesto sin protecci n social ni derechos nicamente con obligaciones como suced a durante la revoluci n industrial
805243 trotsky dijo una vez que l ni se sent a ruso ni jud o quiz s solo un poco socialdem crata mientras tanto lenin all por el a o 1922 permiti la privatizaci n de la agricultura los dichosos medios de producci n adem s con un xito econ mico rotundo pese a que fue lo primero que aboli stalin cuando alcanz el poder
805244 el proletariado sigue existiendo solo que empleado en el sector servicios el salario sigue existiendo y por tanto la plusval a
805245 el sistema de bienestar es una respuesta al crack e 1929 y a las demandas sindicales de los 50
805246 1 no estoy en contra de los medios de produccion fabricas granjas etc estoy en contra de la propiedad privada sobre estos dichosos diccionarios
805247 francotirador ya tuve profesora que me ense o ortograf a en primaria ya te dije las causas de mis fallos
805248 es que si estuvieras en contra de los medios de producci n querido marxista el obvio te regalaba un taparrabos y un billete de avi n para el amazonas y podr as reunirte con los j baros
805249 que descanses mucho este verano ruby me ha parecido muy interesante el debate con el marxista la participaci n del anonimo rafael es totalmente despreciable que se vaya a su casa
805250 hablando del trotskismo me gustar a se alar que los trostkistas del poum fueron injustamente condenados por los comunistas en la guerra civil en una maniobra muy sucia para apartarlos de la escena pol tica
805251 marxista dijo le puedes decir a ruby que mire los ips por si no me crees
805252 pd si tuvieras un solo dedo de frente te dar as cuenta que la forma de expresarse de el y la mia es totalmente diferente
805253 te agradezaco que me hayas defendido pero modera tu tono ya se que a francotirador le va el rollo de crispaci n porque no tiene mas argumentos
805254 suga a pesar de que ha hecho algun comentario un poco fuera de tono ha sabido mantener un debate normal y rebatir mis argumentos en vez corregirme faltas de ortografia
805255 anonimo rafael modera el tono al francotirador le van los debates en ese rollo de haber quien es el mas listillo si le sigues el juego eres igual que el asi que te recomendaria que pasaras de l o le contestes con normalidad cuando suelta uno de sus ingenios humoristicos
805256 suga dijo tienes raz n ludwig pero con la capitana de vacaciones y t el franco tirador o yo como grumetes al mando es evidente que el barco avanza un poco a la deriva
805257 que te lo pases bien por los festivales de verano ruby esto os va a gustar
805258 an nimo dijo menudo soliloquio teneis formado que pena de blog

805287 we are setting up here because there is so much demand the china market is so strong and we can offer the convenience and skills of being based in hong kong
805288 hong kong has a very good supply of animators and effects designers from at least three colleges
805289 started in l a with people thinking about the region
805290 i was already working with caa as a producer and then i was offered the amazing resources of the agency the model that the agency works off of is something so novel and different for this market that it was a really interesting opportunity
805291 our business is very much built on representation of talent we work with fantastic artists help them capitalize on opportunities that exist or that we create and we work with them on their careers our goal is to emulate the u s office in any way we can
805292 we represent some clients who we feel have tremendous international potential and we work with them in that space but we also represent those who are totally local we have the resources to go either direction
805293 at the initial stages we took a decision to focus on directors because directors were not represented in china we strongly believe that directors and writers lead to material and packages that create opportunities for all our clients
805294 we find that because the marketplace in china is so new and growing and there are so many new players in the marketthat the concept of packaging is embraced
805295 we are taking a lot of the strain off the financier
805296 most companies in this area are management companies rather than agencies they are really producing movies for their clients we think that is a very difficult model to sustain because even the most prolific production companies are making four to five movies a year where we can package together 20 25 movies a year
805297 we think that the china market is going to grow by 30 40 per year for many years to come
805298 es lo racional que se haga una rectificaci n del fallo me parece justo y necesario una rectificaci n del caso y espero que atiendan ese pedido

805319 if you could have only one video about sea kayaking this would be a very good choice
805320 breadth depth and details make this video demand more than a one time survey a comprehensive sea kayaking instructional textbook
805321 we bought one for rental but discovered people want to own it so now we sell lots of them
805322 if you are serious about learning to sea kayak the video is well worth the price

805360 i havent seen this much anger in a long long time
805361 nothing has awakened normally complacent white americans more than the prospect of america having an overtly nonwhite president

805509 isnt a home with two alcoholics an imperfect home better than no home
805510 but what about the evil of not placing all the other children in normal homes
805511 remind me again why we have martyrs in the church i guess caving to an unjust law is quite acceptable hey what was st thomas more thinking
805512 on paper im the reigning world champion in three events but im only looking to the first two because they are more quantifiable the individual is my event its a bit more businesslike for me whereas the team is more emotional because you share it with three other guys the madison is a lottery its harder to win it so i will take it as it comes but were going to be strong with cav just out of the tour
805513 its a completely different feeling i feel like a tradesman going to work every day it helps coming home at the end of the day and having other things like my kids to bring me down to earth in the run up to athens i was a 23 year old trying to fulfil what everyone had been saying i could do since i was 12 whereas now if its not to be its not to be even if it wont be for the want of trying
805514 he is a fantastic coach and hed known me since i was a kid but he was as emotional as i was as unstable as me
805515 i was an emotional washout afterwards didnt sleep all night then i had to get up with three other guys and do the same again in the team pursuit after that i had a day off and couldnt have cared less about the madison i was completely finished id got what i wanted had a fantastic olympics and wanted to go out and get drunk then go home and enjoy it so i met cath my fiancee had three or four beers walked around athens didnt have a care in the world and felt really good afterwards i realised we were the best team on the track and could have won it if we had been a bit luckier
805516 i put on a stone enjoyed being normal there had been a constant olympic burden over my head all the time it was the one thing i had wanted above all else but it takes so much out of you i was so focused on beating mcgee it dominated my life for a year and a half
805517 up to the moment my children were born all i had was cycling it was the be all and end all of life if i was injured or didnt win an olympic gold what was i going to do the beauty of children is they bring you back to earth if someone goes faster ill come home and nothing will have changed for them its a stable healthy thing
805518 he wasnt a father in the true father to son sense and one reason i never kept in contact with him after we met was that i didnt have a lot of respect for him as a person ive got over his death now the gaps between thinking about it have got longer one positive thing is that ive got to know my sister in australia shannon who is five or six years older there is stuff i feel guilty about whether i grieved as much as i should im pleased that he cant do any more damage to himself
805519 the main thing thats happened since athens is that ive established myself as a track rider who rides the road before i was a talented young bike rider who could win an olympics and maybe make it on the road
805520 i love it even after everything i was bitter pissed off about it all the shit but its still the best race in the world
805521 the tour is just as special everyones focused on it for three weeks and the games is the same i saw the magnitude of it when i was 19 in sydney and it was an incredible impression i felt i know what i want to do with my life for the next 10 years
805522 you see a 10 000 seat restaurant in the village with all these people going through the same thing as you and theres amazing camaraderie i remember we had finished racing we were in the canteen and matthew pinsent walked in saw us in our gb tracksuits and asked if it was all right to sit down with us he didnt know who we were
805523 congratulations to my team mate on his deserved first grand prix victory
805524 it the result for me was nowhere near as bad as it could have been as we could have had kimi and felipe ahead of us
805525 the race could have been better for me my start was ok but felipes was better and he managed to overtake me my lap times were good and i kept the gap slightly small with our strategy we still had the chance to pass him but the damaged tyre destroyed my race i dont know why it happened but at least i scored some points so the result was not too bad for me
805526 it has been a moment i have been targeting for many years now since i eyed the possibility to be a formula one driver i wanted to improve my fitness to try and achieve this goal and to achieve it is pleasing i am very happy with the win hopefully it is the first of many
805527 there have been various incidents this season that have happened when ive been in a position to fight for a victory today lewis and massa were fastest in the race i tried to put pressure on massa hoping he would have a mechanical failure and it seemed to work
805528 it is just unbelievable after the race in hockenheim and the big crash
805529 i could not believe it when i saw felipes engine go and i was second i was under pressure from kimi with soft tyres and i was struggling quite a lot we knew since friday that the soft tyres would be difficult
805530 i had a really good car it was perfect until the last stint unbelievable in my first year

805559 orang yang tertinggal oleh shalat ashar seolah olah ia dirampas kehilangan keluarganya dan hartanya
805560 makna kata yatirakum amaalakum watarturrajula apabila engkau membunuh buruannya atau merampas hartanya
805561 kami bersama sama dengan buraidah di dalam suatu peperangan pada hari yang berawan lalu ia berkata segerakanlah shalat ashar karena sesungguhnya nabi bersabda barangsiapa yang meninggalkan shalat ashar maka gugurlah amalnya
805562 wasabbih bihamdi rabbika qabla waqablal ghuruubi sucikanlah dengan memuji tuhanmu sebelum terbit matahari dan sebelum terbenamnya

805564 rasulullah bersabda apabila salah seorang di antara kamu mendapatkan satu sujud satu rakaat dari shalat ashar sebelum matahari terbenam maka hendaklah ia menyempurnakan shalatnya
805565 sesungguhnya ajalmu dibandingkan dengan ajal umat umat sebelum kamu adalah seperti waktu antara shalat ashar dan terbenamnya matahari

805569 janganlah orang orang arab dusun mengalahkan kamu atas penamaan shalat maghribmu
805570 orang orang arab dusun itu menyebut shalat maghrib dengan isya
805571 shalat yang paling berat bagi orang orang munafik adalah shalat isya dan fajar
805572 andaikata mereka mengetahui betapa besar pahala shalat shalat atamah isya dan fajar maka mereka akan mendatanginya meskipun harus merangkak
805573 yang terpilih yakni yang terbaik hendaklah disebut shalat isya karena allah taala berfirman dan sesudah shalat isya
805574 kita semua bergiliran untuk shalat isya dengan nabi maka beliau sering melambatkan waktu mengerjakan shalat itu yakni mengakhirkan dari awal waktunya

805582 maka datanglah nabi seperti masih kelihatan olehku sekarang sedang kepala beliau meneteskan air dan beliau meletakkan tangannya di atas kepalanya mengusap kepala dari samping dan bersabda kalau tidak akan memberatkan bagi umatku akan kuperintahkan mereka melakukan shalat isya pada waktu begini

805592 rasulullah bersabda janganlah kamu sengaja untuk shalat pada waktu tepat terbitnya matahari dan juga terbenamnya
805593 rasulullah bersabda apabila sinar matahari terbit maka akhirkanlah shalat sehingga matahari naik dalam satu riwayat hingga muncul 4 92
805594 sesungguhnya kamu melakukan suatu shalat kami telah menemani rasulullah maka kami tidak pernah melihat beliau melakukan shalat yang beliau telah melarang melakukannya 21 yakni dua rakaat sesudah shalat ashar
805595 saya shalat sebagaimana saya melihat sahabat sahabatku shalat saya tidak melarang seorang pun untuk mengerjakan shalat baik pada waktu malam maupun siang menurut apa yang dikehendaki olehnya kecuali pada waktu terbitnya matahari dan terbenamnya
805596 nabi shalat dua rakaat sesudah shalat ashar kemudian beliau bersabda orang orang dari suku abdul qais telah membuatku sibuk yang menyebabkanku terhalang melakukan shalat dua rakaat sesudah zhuhur
805597 demi zat yang telah mewafatkan nabi beliau tidak meninggalkan kedua rakaat itu sehingga beliau bertemu dengan allah taala dan beliau tidak bertemu allah wafat sehingga beliau repot terhadap shalat
805598 rasulullah tidak pernah meninggalkan shalat dua rakaat secara sembunyi sembunyi maupun terang terangan yaitu dua rakaat sebelum shalat subuh dan dua rakaat sesudah ashar

805833 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends were con fident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
805834 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier with trying to make the club better at this point in time than to do this we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy

805842 hes one of the greatest hitters ever to play the game its going to be a battle between us starting tonight

805872 todo el mundo sabe que la catolica se cae a pedazos sus facultades estan hasta las patas esta recontra vieja en cambio la san martin tiene una infraestructura moderna
805873 nosotros tambien tenemos buenos profesores algunos han trabajado en bancos y buenas empresas
805874 la san martin la mejor por donde la mires ni punto de comparacion con la garcilazo ni alas

805882 igual no pintas al parecer lima tiene las mejores universidades ni la de piura ni la de trujillo ni otras pueden igualarlas no te pases pes para el 78 tbn la de piura no pinta ub quense ps mucha weea con uds
805883 sus universidades de pitucos y huecas no le llegan ni a los pies a la san martin lo que pasa es que como tamos segundos ya se le tiran encima y por ultimo que me venga a decir eso alguien de una universidad reconocida no gente de la de piura o utp estan hasta las patas
805884 y en el curso de finanzas avanzadas los 5 primeros puestos fueron ricardo correa u
805885 la san martin se caracteriza por la independencia de sus facultades cada facu es aut noma e independiente
805886 se rumorea en las aulas de la pacifico es que esan estaba a punto de quebrar por eso tuvieron que abrir el pregrado
805887 la d piura tuvo q crear el pad la pacifico su escuela d posgrado y la catolica el centrum porque dichas universidades estaban a punto d quebrar
805888 esan hace mucho tiempor era la unica que ofrecia postgrados en administracion pero desde que abrio centrum y pad piura esan a perdido prestigio
805889 perfil del mercado educativo 2007 donde sale la usmp segunda hay cosas que no se dicen
805890 nadie lo puede negar sobre la insercion laboral eso es porque a universidades como pacifico upc lima va poca gente porque no pueden pagar las altas pensiones masomenos se graduaran 30 por ciclo en cambio la san martin tiene pensiones promedio y va mucha gente y no vamos a esperar que de los 100 q egresan todos consiguan empleo
805891 no me digan que cualquier hijo de veccino entra alli asi sea el primero de la promocion de la uni sino alguien que tenga un
805892 las 3 universidades mas caras del pais u pacifico 1260 upc 1252 ulima 1082
805893 su especialidad es la odontologia y es una de las mejores en medicina
805894 reclutan a universitarios de esas universidades saben que ahi se imparte una buena educacion y saben q los egresados son buenos
805895 me gustaria ver que un sanmartiniano resolviera mis examenes de costos matematicas o de microeconomia seguramente no llegan a entender ni lo que dice el enunciado
805896 esta universidad es mejor en esta carrera porque su curricula es mejor
805897 esan tiene bajo nivel que es facil y bla bla bla
805898 el mba de esan es el barato ahora a comparacion de centrum y pacifico la calidad en esan a bajado
805899 esan iba a quebrar por eso abrio el pregrado ya que antes era un instituo superior en sus inicios ya que la carrera de administracion era tecnica
805900 salio en un reportaje del 4 que tenian problemas con la municipalidad de surco xq no tenian salida a una avenida principal
805901 no creo que esan teniendo tanto prestigio se haya arriesgado a hacer un mal nivel en pregrado al principio le sera dificil pero en poco tiempo seguro alcanzara el nivel de la pacifico o catolica
805902 y otra cosa el mba de esan es el barato ahora a comparacion de centrum y pacifico la calidad en esan a bajado
805903 antes era un instituo superior en sus inicios ya que la carrera de administracion era tecnica
805904 creo que todas las unis tiene cosas malas y buenas asi que dejen de criticar
805905 se nota que eres de la de piura primero la de piura no tiene campus propio no tiene prestigio eso que es buena en administracion lo dudo batsante xq no suena ni truena informate no con lo que pienas visita la web de abet que es maneja estandares a nivel internacional y no en lo que te dicen tus profes
805906 si hablamos de infraestructuras la udep esta ubicada en miraflores en cambio la san martin esta en santa anita ademas ustedes parecen estar orgullosos de sus campus grandes son tan tontos que no se dan cuenta que a mas espacio menos exlcusividad los salones de la san martin son para mas de 40 personas y de udep para 35 a lo mucho quien aprende mas los de udep o los de la usmp
805907 el campus de la pucp tiene un campus de 400 mil metros cuadrados la san martin tiene exactamente 215 mil metros entre ciudad de lima y chiclayo
805908 la que mas paga son primero pacifico la mas cara del pais seguido de upc la de lima todas con pensiones minimas superiores a mil soles y en la catolica la escala 1 de 700 soles se da solo en casos especiales en cambio san martin su pension minima es de 450 soles segun su web
805909 primero los sanmartinianos dicen que su universidad es fichaza a1 que solo va gente con plata y ahora la defiende a capa y espada diciendo que el promedio de pago es 600 soles mensuales
805910 uno d los factores xq uno elige su universidad es xq sabe q la va a poder pagar es decir si uno q va a la catolica pacifico o cayetano y sabe q puede pagar 1500 o 2000 soles mensuales y no llega a graduarse no es xq no la pueda pagar simplemente es xq no pudo rendir lo suficiente o no pudo con la exigencia d la universidad no xq no la pueda pagar al menos en lo q respecta a negocios administracion economia contabilidad d la pacifico c graduan un promedio d 150 en el 2do semestre y 60 en el 1er semestre lo mismo ocurre masomenos con la catolica y lima y la gran mayoria d ellos mas dl 90 ya tiene trabajo a comparacion d tan solo el menos dl 50 d la san martin y ni sikiera consiguen la chamba en dond solo en comunicaciones c graduan mas d 250

805916 como me gustaria estar en la san martin y que mis padres construyeran closets o filmaran bautizos para pagarme la u y asi denunciar a esta universidad por hacer un comercial asi hablando mal de las personas que realizan estos trabajos sera que la san martin se quiere convertir en una universidad elitista
805917 est claro que los rankings se compran por qu si no en este el iese aparece el 19 y en el del economist aparece el 1 lo nico que tengo claro es que para el mba en el iese y en esae te piden el gmat y el toefl como requisitos de admisi n cosa que hacen las mejores escuelas de negocios y el ie no y adem s las aulas del ie est n cada d a m s masificadas por favor que no os enga en los ranking
805918 no solo has de tener en cuenta el lugar tambien el plazo de duracion ie y esade 1 a o iese y esade 2 a os el nivel del toefl dependera de la puntuacion personalmente creo que en el ie te admiten sin problemas
805919 estaba interesado en el ie pq es solamente un a o y es en madrid aunque soy de barcelona pero querr a probar madrid sin embargo he o do voces q el ie no es de tanta calidad como el esade iese es mas sencillo entrar en el ie principalmente por 3 factores el no muy alto nivel de exigencia de la escuela el elevado n mero de estudiantes a o y el heco de que el mba de 10 meses el national no tiene tanta demanda como el international que se equiparar a a los impartidos por iese y esade
805920 la noticia sinceramente creo que peca de ser excesivamenta laudatoria con el instituto de empresa al que dedica la totalidad del ltimo p rrafo del art culo a la vez que no facilita ning n dato ni del iese ni de esade omisi n especialmente grave en este ltimo caso ya que seg n wjs su mba es el mejor del mundo
805921 personalmente esade como instituci n me da mucha m s confianza que el ie y si en esade hacen algo lo hacen bien y no ega an a nadie con publicidad agresiva que otras escuelas utilizan como el ie

805927 one of my first assignments as a business reporter was covering the second failure of dallas sunbelt savings regulators overseeing the bailout fielded questions from reporters and the busted thrifts chief executive tom wageman sat silently in the corner twenty years later the government is still shielding the banking industry from tough questions john reich ots head blasted reporters for staking out banks interviewing customers and stoking public fears saying journalists were seemingly oblivious to the fact that they could drive otherwise healthy banks to fail and push troubled institutions away from potential solutions toward ruin banks shouldnt fail just because someone asks questions if they do consumers have reason to be worried even if their deposits are insured maybe he doesnt read his own signs supervision is part of his offices name but 20 years ago we in texas were at the epicenter and the latest banking malaise shows the lessons from that time were largely ignored by both banks and regulators subprime and its cousins such as alt a loans became just another convenient tool with which mortgage brokers could close deals and collect fees all wrapped in a sales pitch about how rising home prices would make the shaky numbers work the lenders didnt have to worry if the loans went bust their wall street buddies had found something far better than brokered deposits mortgage securities and so here we are a place not all that different than 20 years ago in texas and once again accountability gets passed on from lenders to wall street to the government and then ultimately to the taxpayers
805928 the fact that highly elastic places had price booms is one of the strange facts about the recent price explosion
805929 if these markets return to their historical norm then they will experience further sharp price declines
805930 elasticity was uncorrelated with either price or quantity changes during the bust
805931 even though elastic housing supply mutes the price impacts of housing bubbles the social welfare losses of housing bubbles may be higher in more elastic areas since there will be more overbuilding during the bubble

805968 i need to speak personally about mccain raising the question of whether obama is a risky guy it has nothing to do with his name or skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment with his unreadiness sic to be president he made a personal insult to john mccain i know john mccain this man doesnt have a bigoted bone in his body it was just wrong for senator obama to have done that and it was right for the campaign to call him out in it
805969 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion i urge barack obama to have some faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or race

806036 us presidential candidate barack obama talks about 16 months that we think would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
806037 of course this is by no means an election endorsement who they choose as their president is the americans business
806038 those who operate on the premise of short time periods in iraq today are being more realistic artificially prolonging the tenure of us troops in iraq would cause problems
806039 so far the americans have had trouble agreeing to a concrete timetable for withdrawal because they feel it would appear tantamount to an admission of defeat
806040 but that isnt the case at all if we come to an agreement it is not evidence of a defeat but of a victory of a severe blow we have inflicted on al qaida and the militias
806041 it is a fundamental problem for us that it should not be possible in my country to prosecute offences or crimes committed by us soldiers against our population
806042 at this stage a timetable for withdrawal is unrealistic and we hope our american friends will not bow to domestic political pressures and be hasty in leaving iraq just as the country improves

806228 just like the bi partisan passage of the original ada this bill has been conceived and crafted in a spirit of genuine bipartisanship members of both parties coming together to do the right thing for americans with disabilities
806229 the erosions of rights created by these court cases have created a bizarre catch 22 where people with serious conditions like epilepsy or diabetes could be forced to choose between treating their conditions and forfeiting their protections under the ada or not treating their conditions and being protected that is not what congress intended when we passed the law and this bill is the right fix
806230 working with my good friend tom harkin who has been a tireless advocate on behalf of the disabled we were able to craft a strong bipartisan bill which is a landmark piece of legislation that will ensure the disabled share in the american dream
806231 this is a monumental bill that people from across the political spectrum can wholeheartedly endorse
806232 it strikes an appropriate balance in broadening and safeguarding ada protections for our disabled fellow americans without introducing provisions that courts could once again misconstrue it further safeguards institutions of higher learning from being forced to compromise academic standards

806248 i think it the ranking goes to the attention that the college is always giving to looking at the academic program looking at the extracurriculars finding ways to build on strength
806249 i think it means some good consistent overall strength theres an encouragement that we have that people look at the numbers and look beyond the numbers

806306 the schools are revolutionary the faculty and student body is christian muslim and jewish it is a place where all religions meet and interact on equal footing where the value of each human being comes before their form of religion
806307 the students learn play and work together they learn respect and tolerance instead of hate the school represents ideas and interests for a better future for all faiths and offers a chance for christians to remain in the holy land the mar elias schools are the model the best example for how lasting peace can be achieved
806308 in that situation most of the pitchers dont throw me inside but sliders away if he would have hit me with the first pitch i would have went to first base but three times were inside it seemed so obvious to me i just do what i needed to do
806309 sixteen years after brett favre came to the packers he is returning for a 17th season
806310 having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
806311 bretts a great player to have brett favre on your roster only makes you a better football team
806312 among the most exciting players in pro football annals stands as one of the most productive signal callers will go down as one of the most beloved players of his generation 2007 was one of the most memorable years in his storied career
806313 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
806314 in that situation i had to believe he was trying to hit me even with the bases loaded
806315 we were leading by six runs they come inside hard three times that is the team that has hit me three times already it seemed so obvious to me
806316 i hope not but if its coming i need to take it because i charged the pitcher
806317 im a man i take my consequences i know what i did i think i did the right thing
806318 i wonder why a guy plate umpire tim timmons thought we were going to hit the guy with the bases loaded with a pitch in on the hands
806319 im not going to bring a guy in that throws 85 miles an hour to hit somebody i guarantee it ill bring matt thornton then i will tell them to throw at them thats the way i do business
806320 i came in and im trying to get a double play ball
806321 i threw him my sinker in to try to get him to get a ground ball out of that and it got away from me
806322 i was just standing on the mound and the umpire came up to me and said youre out of here they might think there is something stemming from before but i didnt think i was being thrown out of the game obviously they thought differently and they make the call
806323 we dont play like that ozzie doesnt play like that this team doesnt play like that
806324 i have touched upon the secret of the life of a true catholic what is this secret it is the presence of our lord in the blessed sacrament what is which makes this house so ineffably holy to me and fills its silence with such a meaning it is the fact that my lord is here not merely by that spiritual omnipresence by which he is everywhere but in his incarnate divinity in his divine humanity in the very flesh and blood which he took for us from his virgin mother and which he gave for us on the wood of the cross under this very roof he abides night and day in the tabernacle over the high altar where the little lamp is always shining and at any hour i can go and visit him can fall down on my knees close before him in the silent sanctuary and as often as i wish oh wonder of wonders he gives himself to me in holy communion and every morning i see him offered up yes i may one day offer him up myself to god the father in holy sacrifice in the one perpetual sacrifice of the christian law no doubt this seems to you only a wild delusion it is a delusion however for which thousands upon thousands have joyfully shed their blood and if you should ever come to realize even for a moment what it is to believe this to believe it as firmly as the existence of god or heaven or hell then you will have understood why the catholic church is invincible and what that strange power is which animates the life and the faith of a catholic
806325 we have made a commitment to be at his side at court and we will be at his side when he goes to the union buildings parliament
806326 this show of force we are going to see from monday onwards is directed at the middle class
806327 they want to scare the middle class they want to create a consensus among academics journalists intellectuals saying we have a choice between national security and prosecuting zuma if you pursue him national stability will be compromised
806328 currently most of the media are dominated by commentators decrying the embarrassment to south africa of having a man who faces such a mountain of charges as the next president but rank and file anc supporters far outnumber those concerned with state transparency or international image
806329 previously when zuma was in court he had a lot of support but it wasnt from the anc as a party now the support expressed for him outside court will be formalized because it comes from the ruling party so you have a ruling party at war with the state

806339 creo que mucha gente asume muchas cosas sobre por qu square tom la decisi n de lanzar final fantasy xiii en xbox 360 la realidad es que nos est yendo muy bien y una compa a como square no puede ignorar eso es f cil pensar que estaba pasando algo entre bastidores pero la respuesta m s obvia es que estamos vendiendo mucho y que los desarrolladores quieren que sus juegos lleguen al mayor n mero de gente
806340 ya hemos conseguido vender m s consolas xbox 360 en jap n que las que nunca vendimos con xbox
806341 jap n siempre ser un mercado dif cil para nosotros pero estamos mejorando nuestras relaciones con desarrolladores japoneses como square capcom konami etc lo mejor que podemos hacer es seguir buscando el apoyo de esos desarrolladores

806726 we have a cracking team and in the last year we have moved on to leading certain things internationally
806727 you dont feel its august because its always raining in spain i would mind working but heres its just fine why take holidays in august its less expensive to take holidays in october im going to dingle tomorrow for the weekend
806728 why would i mind working in august i take long weekends
806729 i enjoy coming back to work after a long weekend they look after the staff really well
806730 when you go away for a long time you worry about the workload youll come back to
806731 a lot stay after 6pm you can go off and play playstation or football but you still have to get the work done
806732 google has a system of flat management which means you can drive processes and procedures in your area they let you make decisions and they are very flexible and accommodating in regard to the working day
806733 why would i mind working in august i really really love my job i dont dream about holidays and when i go on holidays its nice to get home this is my ideal job fantastic and fun and flexible as long as the work is done they dont mind when i do it i was a headhunter before and so i had a lot of time to research what i wanted to do my background is in computing and i took extra courses with the open university in london before i applied for this
806734 i only wear it on ceremonial occasions like this one
806735 is working for google as good as they say its even better
806736 this is the best place to work you get respect from the company and the people are great and its an international so you can travel wherever you like you get everything you want you dont have to get more out of them because theyre already giving you everything why would i want to get more
806737 i love the rain i come from brittany so dublin in august is perfect for me
806738 weve lived in london and in seattle we realised that if we moved to dublin wed lose all our family support you can either commute to see your family at weekends or commute during the week and be with your family at weekends we chose the second option and google is one of the best employers in ireland and its flexible so its worth the extra effort
806739 a lot of us go home in august i went to portugal in july and it rained for two weeks

806741 u2 always felt it would be pathetic to be good at the music and bad at the business
806742 i think its part of the artists responsibility quite honestly and artists who arent interested in that are going to find it harder to reach an audience
806743 artists and managers who have their wits about them are now doing things for themselves that were historically done by record companies
806744 the business model that i expect to see develop in the future will be in partnership with the isps
806745 some music will be heard on services where the revenue comes from advertisers it wouldnt suit the clients that i manage but the future will be multi platform and artists will have to embrace that if they want to be successful
806746 i dont have nostalgia for the way things were more music is being made and listened to than ever before and the multiple platforms provided by streaming services digital downloads and physical products should make it a more interesting world it is certainly more complex but the opportunities are greater than ever
806747 we were pretty suspicious of greatest hits which were usually premature and had no artist input and often signalled the end of a bands career we felt it was the bands responsibility to compile and order its own catalogue and these albums should be as much a part of their canon of work as a regular album
806748 we have treated it as an opportunity not a chore
806749 i do not expect the cd to disappear in my lifetime but i think artists and record companies have to put more effort into it otherwise why would people want one over a download oh really the artwork surrounding the release of a new music from an artist that youre interested in is in many ways just as interesting as the music i can remember when carrying a 12 inch lp down the street was almost an expression of the kind of person you were every bit as significant as what you wore or how you cut your hair these things evolve but i think the industry as a whole is missing the opportunity to produce the digital visual coefficient of an album sleeve and watch this space because its something u2 are addressing on their next album
806750 the only people who think music isnt free any more are the record companies
806751 it disturbs me greatly when i hear quite sensible people talking about the end of copyright i think copyright is part of civilisation and wed be very foolish indeed to accept the proposal that it is now a redundant concept
806752 i think key to this is going to be co operation and revenue sharing with the isps your a dh its asps admit your wrong and once that principle is accepted you will get better quality music legally and pay a reasonable price for it
806753 the panties for peace campaign was launched by the womens organization lanna action for burma on oct 16 2007 in the hopes of bringing an end to the military regimes rampant abuse of burmas population and the abuse of burmas women in particular the basis of this protest is the superstition of the male led military junta they believe that contact with womens garments particularly those that cover the lower half of the body is emasculating
806754 it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign

806884 it is our commitment to support our travel partners and give them the advantage they need in order to sell cruises and grow their business
806885 with the new policy groups your way will give our travel partners the ability to lock in a rate and hold blocks of staterooms for a longer length of time in order to generate new business opportunities
806886 travel agents have told us that booking promotional and affinity groups would be more successful for our brands with increased time to market and sell
806887 our groups your way policy reflects valuable feedback from our travel partners providing them with flexibility to sell more cruises in different ways thereby increasing their revenue
806888 in fairness theyre probably doing it because theyre struggling but there are ways of tracking and deterring pre owned sales
806889 so far our onboard spending level appears to be holding
806890 we are really excited about this new enhancement of the clia id card
806891 this initiative by clia is in response to discussion and recommendation by the clia travel agent advisory board our purpose in recommending this change was to upgrade the clia id card to recognize professional agents committed to enhancing their professional skills through continuing education leading to advanced certification and those agents who have already achieved that status
806892 clia has an obligation to provide member benefits including the option of obtaining a clia id card
806893 we also have an obligation to provide member cruise lines and other industry partners assurance that our agent partners are actively engaged in the sale of travel and are committed to professional development
806894 clias training programs are frequently acknowledged as the best in the travel industry and we strongly believe that this evolution of id card requirements is a win win win situation for the clia agent for the traveling consumer and for industry suppliers who recognize the value of clia agents
806895 i feel good that as one of the travel professionals who spoke out about clias id requirements that it finally found its way home im proud of clia and terry dale for implementing these new requirements hats off to them its important we continue the fight for increased agent standards
806896 as for me i plan to keep it going clias move was a very important step in this direction now we just need the true ossn and travel sellers nacta to follow with increased requirements to help prevent the pseudo agents from focusing on them
806897 agents were required to sell 750 000 in crystal cruises last year to qualify for this trip
806898 the great news is that 66 agents have already qualified in 2008 with 121 million in combined sales to date
806899 we are seeing a larger number of agents selling larger dollars of crystal every year
806900 to sell a crystal cruise you need to explain to a client precisely what it is like to be on board this cruise line
806901 it is beyond just the ship itself it is the total luxury cruise excursions dining the quality of the staff it is a unique feeling onboard thats what sells crystal
806902 year to date we have had a 47 or 12 3 million increase in our fuel costs
806903 we are budgeting 38 6 million for fuel this year our fuel surcharges will only recover 12 of our fuel costs this year fuel costs are like a sieve you dont know where to put your finger to stop it
806904 we will be renovating public areas and moving some bar locations we will be investing in new lighting and slot machines in our casinos and also converting some aa cabins and penthouses
806905 it has helped offset some of the sluggishness of domestic sales in this economy
806906 and we especially see the increase in international business when we are sailing in the baltic or mediterranean in two to three years time we see our international business growing to about 25 of our total sales
806907 we are adding new international tv channels we have added a new yamaha passport to music program
806908 we have also further upgraded our excursion program and we are introducing social networking classes at the crystal university at sea
806909 we have such a diverse program of activities at crystal it is almost hard to top it every year with our new world cruise we have already offered passengers excursions such as running with the bulls in pamplona an air gliding program in oahu hot air balloon rides in dubai private helicopters in florence or venice and even a tour of draculas castle in romania
806910 the response rate was considerably higher this year which is indicative of peoples continued desire to travel to see and experience the world
806911 although perennial favorites such as italy once again appear on this years list of dream destinations the results point to new interest in the more exotic and emerging destinations like india and egypt

806963 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
806964 although there has been uncertainty regarding bretts return ted thompson and coach mccarthy had previously discussed this and have had a plan in place coach mccarthy will talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly

806980 when i do the initial interview with a prospective client ill often ask them where did you learn about our firm what was it that stood out for you more and more people are saying your video your video is something that really stood out to us video is a natural marketing tool for law firms because the practice of law is really about communication and advocacy on behalf of a client a prospective client is more likely to call your firm if they have heard and seen you speak
806981 with video the prospective clients are able to size up the firm size up the lawyer and decide if this is someone they really want to speak to which leads them to develop a level of trust to make them pick up the phone
806982 online video presence has become the word of mouth of yesteryear a substitute for a referral from a friend or a neighbor you are really communicating your own personal image presence and character just like a referral would be but going out to a huge audience and making an opportunity to really get out there in front of your prospective clients

806992 well damn look whos here its good to see you jack happy thanksgiving
806993 hi travis i think ill pass on dinner i havent had much of an appetite lately how have you been
806994 ok i guess got a couple months left in this tour then ill be heading home well be handing baghdad area security over to the 4th cav in february so what brings you here
806995 lets talk over dinner jack ill read it when we get back
806996 so there was a firefight and some civilians got killed well our guys are getting killed too and a lot of them are dead because iraqi civilians didnt tell us about insurgent activity in their areas or are actively helping the insurgency
806997 what happened in haditha last week was a massacre travis and now its being covered up there was a roadside bombing and sporadic shooting in the area but the rest of that statement is lies twenty four iraqi civilians were slaughtered by kilo company marines many of them were children others were women who were trying to shield them
806998 i went there i talked to a couple of the marines involved to iraqi witnesses and to staff at the hospital where the bodies were taken
806999 jack those marines might have had a grudge against their squad leader or company co and just want to get them in trouble by claiming there were intentional killings and the iraqi witnesses are probably lying thats probably all this is about
807000 weve known each other a long time travis so dont bullshit me im going to tell you what happened and i want you to listen
807001 the roadside bomb blew up the last humvee in the convoy i saw the drivers severed legs in the wreckage when i got there the rest of him well there were body parts a hundred yards away that morning started off bad and got worse in a hurry a few minutes after the bombing a car drove up there were five iraqis in it the marines wanted revenge that dead driver had been well liked in kilo company they ordered the iraqis out of the car and killed them
807002 they had it coming if you ask me they were probably spotters for the insurgents who set off the roadside bomb
807003 yeah spotters always drive to the site of the bombing to take a look around and admire their handiwork so well know they were the spotters get real travis
807004 no the men in that car were cooperative they had their hands up but those marines wanted payback and didnt care who paid they killed them all then one of the marines riddled the bodies with bullets and pissed on them
807005 a marine who was there and saw it all told me
807006 you have a bad habit of only believing what you want to believe travis
807007 you sound just like one of my sergeants chiles hes always on my case the armys case bushs case
807008 you came here to tell me what happened in haditha so tell me
807009 there was a row of houses about 80 yards from the road on the far side of a vacant lot the marines headed for those houses
807010 if they were it wasnt from those houses but that didnt matter all that mattered was vengeance they went into the first house and shot the elderly father of the family he was in a wheel chair holding a quran they shot him travis nine times they killed his wife and his four year old grandson and shot the rest of the family except for his daughter in law she fled with a two month old baby while they were busy killing everyone else
807011 yeah there were a lot of weapons in that house american weapons
807012 youve made your point jack i dont need to hear any more
807013 yes you do and youre going to hear it youre going to hear all of it the marines went to the next house and killed everyone there the father the mother their eight year old son and all of their daughters a 14 year old girl a 10 year old girl a 5 year old girl and a 3 year old girl they killed them all a 1 year old girl was staying with the family they killed her too
807014 there werent any girls in the third house there were four brothers the marines killed all of them
807015 there must have been some resistance something that triggered this
807016 there was no resistance none of those people were any threat at all i went to the hospital many of the victims were shot at point blank range execution style one of them an old man was blown in half by a grenade several of the victims were shot in the back one of the children was decapitated by gunfire or a grenade blast the first neighbors into the second house said the children killed there were huddled together on a bed the women were trying to shield them
807017 jack you know what combats like the fear the adrenaline rush the confusion sometimes the rules of engagement cant be adhered to
807018 what happened that morning in haditha wasnt combat travis those marines executed civilians theres no other way to say it 24 civilians they killed defenseless women and children they killed babies so quit giving me your captain america excuses dont fucking tell me rules of engagement just cant be adhered to sometimes
807019 when that car drove up the killing started the first lies got told the squad leader
807020 i dont want to hear any 9 11 bullshit from you we arent fighting terrorism here bush wanted payback and didnt care who paid he wanted oil and his neocons wanted an empire and now weve got a civil war on our hands
807021 its complicated no doubt about it but we are fighting terrorists here youre in intel you know damn well there are foreign fighters in haditha so dont bullshit me theyre terrorists trained by al qaeda and sent through syria into iraq
807022 that grandfather in his wheelchair wasnt a foreign fighter or a terrorist and in case you havent noticed yet this is iraq were the foreign fighters
807023 that crippled old man didnt blow up that humvee travis neither did his wife those slaughtered little girls didnt blow it up that one year old baby those marines killed didnt blow it up either
807024 well what do you want me to do about it
807025 i want you to start facing reality were just making things worse here
807026 we cant leave if you think its bad now just watch therell be genocide if we withdraw
807027 theres genocide now half a million dead and counting im done with this haditha was the last straw for me we both know whatll happen itll be covered up everyone will lie about it right on up the chain of command the lying started right away when that squad leader said theyd claim the men in that car were running away i was lied to when i was there about everything only two of those marines told me the truth but theyll lie too if this gets investigated thisll be covered up
807028 incidents like this have to be sanitized for a greater good
807029 what greater good is that for the good of the killers for the good of the corps for the good of the pentagon
807030 yeah a muslim civil war its been going on for a thousand years and now were caught in the middle of it why are we here travis there was no wmd iraq had nothing to do with 9 11 we shouldnt be here at all
807031 its insane to wage war on a tactic terror is a tactic travis
807032 who were the killers in haditha and who were the innocent
807033 its not the same youre off duty today so lets go see whats the same and what isnt ill give you a ride to haditha you can ask the neighbors of those slaughtered families who the innocent were and who killed them you can walk to those graves with them and ask if weve won their hearts and minds yet
807034 it was an unfortunate incident regrettable to say the least but its understandable insurgents and terrorists hide among civilians they
807035 so if americans massacre innocents its understandable but if muslims massacre innocents its terrorism
807036 youre overreacting to this haditha incident jack youve got to keep it in perspective
807037 perspective i saw those dead children travis i saw those dead women who tried to shield them i saw dead babies and a dead old man in a wheelchair killed in cold blood by united states marines the few the proud slaughtered in a three hour rampage i want no part of this anymore im resigning my commission if you have any honor and integrity left youll resign your commission too
807038 i cant do that i wont do that we have to defeat the terrorists

807101 you know i dont think its that rare sure ive had the unfortunate occasion to know many very bad men and i have had friends whose husbands are pretty pathetic but there are a lot of men i know who are just like my husband in that respect im sure that some of my friends would agree with me that their husbands are like mine this way i think a part of it is that were mormon and family is everything to us we go to church on sunday every sunday and in our sunday school classes and sacrament meeting we discuss marriage and parenthood and all sorts of topics that remind us of how we need to be better and give us tools to help us our families are the only things we can take with us when we die as a result of this i know a lot of very very good men i also know men who arent mormon but who are like my husband this way
807102 this code may not run i have not tried it i have only tested it
807103 a nica coisa do atl tico que foi legal hoje foi a torcida o time n o foi bem piorar mais imposs vel estamos na zona de rebaixamento
807104 ficar escutando isso a xingamentos ningu m gosta mas o torcedor est de parab ns fez a parte dele agora tentar levantar a cabe a mas dif cil todo jogo ficar falando isso
807105 essa vit ria foi muito importante para o nosso time
807106 quem bobear vai descer muito todos times t m que saber onde perder pontos nosso exemplo contra o coritiba n s perdemos 2 a 0 enquanto o gr mio venceu por isso s o l deres
807107 a falta que originou o primeiro gol n o existiu o rbitro n o foi bem e nos prejudicou porque tivemos que trocar dois meias que n o estavam bem e poderiam melhorar ao longo do jogo
807108 foi uma jogada que n o houve falta s isso tiramos o michael porque ele n o estava bem e depois o molina sentiu mas logo no intervalo n s colocamos o time na frente e pressionamos o coritiba mas os gols n o sa ram
807109 houve fatalidade hoje o coritiba chegou quatro vezes e marcou tr s gols encaixou um contra ataque e fez um e depois num cruzamento tivemos espa o para avan ar pela direita mas n o conseguimos
807110 jogar aqui dentro muito bom muito bom a torcida hoje foi nota mil n o temos nada o que falar n s que n o jogamos nada e n o permitimos que a torcida sa sse daqui contente
807111 agora os fantasmas e as preocupa es voltam todas tivemos uma tima chance para sair do rebaixamento mas perdemos em casa
807112 a atitude mudou senti uma equipe guerreira com vontade de vencer ainda estamos em busca de um time titular mas j temos uma base forte para alcan ar o caminho de vit rias
807113 espero entrar na briga para permanecer na equipe sei da qualidade dos demais jogadores como o tuta o finazzi e o luan aos poucos vou ganhar meu espa o
807114 foi a melhor atua o do botafogo sob meu comando a partida foi bem disputada e a produtividade do ataque foi muito boa todos est o de parab ns
807115 ajudou um pouco mas n o foi determinante at porque o time base mudou um pouco de qualquer maneira o resultado deve ser comemorado pois o campeonato tem grandes equipes e o desempenho do atl tico pr na arena da baixada costuma ser muito bom
807116 foi uma vit ria importante para a gente que vinha em uma situa o muito dif cil para retomar o caminho um jogo a cima das dificuldades que eu esperava sabia que o sport uma boa equipe entrosada mas me surpreendeu a movimenta o o entrosamento que o sport apresentou mas como eu disse para um dia de trabalho acho que foi muito bom fundamentalmente pelos tr s pontos
807117 vit ria importante mas acima de tudo ficou muito claro que a gente pode e vai evoluir e podemos formar um time competitivo com trabalho no dia a dia a gente pode al ar v os mais altos e coisas melhores
807118 uma dificuldade enorme que tivemos na marca o principalmente no primeiro tempo os jogadores se movimentam muito no meio campo e isso dificultou a nossa marca o assim como foi no gol do sport
807119 no gol n s tivemos uma desaten o que o jogador roger penetrou de tr s e nosso zagueiro n o conseguiu marcar acompanhar no segundo tempo n s acertamos na marca o determinamos quem pegava quem e assim o segundo tempo foi melhor e dentro deste pouco tempo que tive para trabalhar foi uma boa apresenta o
807120 sem d vida foi muito importante pois o torcedor est impaciente com raz o pelos ltimos resultados e fazendo o gol imediatamente depois de ter sofrido retomou o entusiasmo da torcida e dos jogadores e isso foi importante para todos

807147 we had 13 specific audits in qantas engineering last year so we just see this as more of them casa doing their job which is to be the regulator
807148 what theyre doing i think is coming in and doing their job which is to make sure people have utter confidence in the safety of qantas but also the probity of the regulatory system
807149 casa audited qantas generally and qantas engineering specifically a great deal
807150 obviously events like manila where we had the aircraft depressurise they were an entirely different kind of a normal run of business things that are being reported almost daily
807151 firstly our aircraft travel around the globe how you avoid having them touched by foreign hands while you do that is a mystery to me
807152 but the second thing we have 7000 engineers employed in australia two thousand of those are doing heavy maintenance
807153 so that means the vast majority and i mean the vast majority of our work is actually done here in australia and has been for many many years and will continue to be
807154 qantas safety standards are so high and so well recognised that when we do have an accident like the other day with ojk the aircraft in manila its big news and were not afraid of the scrutiny

807206 we welcome unicefs decision to hold one of the companies that has been building mattityahu east settlement accountable for attempting to destroy our community our village has engaged in a three and a half year nonviolent campaign to save our land and an international boycott is an important complement to our weekly protests this is a victory but we need many more like it
807207 yesterday we confirmed that unicef has concluded that it will not consider partnerships direct or indirect with mr lev leviev or any of his corporate entities and will not accept financial or other support that we know is from him or his corporate entities the concerned parts of the unicef family including our national committees have been advised of this
807208 unicef officials visited us in may and saw the terrible impacts on our children of the theft of our farmland for the expansion of zufim settlement by levievs company leader we thank unicef for upholding international law and supporting childrens rights and we call on other organizations to do the same
807209 we applaud the lawsuit filed by bilin for holding businesses accountable for settlement construction and violations of palestinian rights we also believe that these well known israeli businessmen like boymelgreen and leviev who often try to hide their involvement in israeli settlement construction from the international community need to be made known to the public and to their business associates
807210 boymelgreen is the controlling interest holder in the green park project
807211 flat buyers in my residential project green park in modiin illit will not be harmed
807212 of his investments in israel green park is noteworthy a building project in modiin illit
807213 the green park companies have a single director who resides in the montreal region it is believed that she is likely a nominal director having no direct involvement with green park
807214 danya cebus will build the 230 million green park project in the haredi ultra orthodox town of upper modiin the company bought 939 dunam 234 75 acres in the residential east matityahu lot zoned for the haredi community danya cebuss parent company africa israel investments will market the project
807215 it is known and agreed upon among the buyers that the landscaping work and building for the project will be carried out by the danya cebus company ltd
807216 a security company contracted by leviev was accused this year by a local human rights monitor of participating in practices of humiliation whipping torture sexual abuse and in some cases assassinations
807217 few schools little treated drinking water roads unrepaired since colonial days and little public investment geared to fixing these problems one of the richest areas in angola also appears to be one of the most backward
807218 im not famous and i hope i never become so id hate for women to go for me simply because im the singer in a band the only way i want to touch people is through my music anything else is superficial and i want no part of it
807219 non sono famoso e spero di non diventarlo odio che le donne vengano da me solo perch sono il cantante di una band lunico modo con cui voglio toccare la gente con la mia musica tutto il resto superficiale e non mi interessa
807220 this campaign cant only be about me it must be about us it must be about what we can do together this campaign must be the occasion the vehicle of your hopes and your dreams it will take your time your energy and your advice to push us forward when were doing right and to let us know when were not this campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship restoring our sense of common purpose and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change thats why im in this race not just to hold an office but to gather with you to transform a nation
807221 you should thank tim berners lee not just for giving us the web but for articulating whats gone wrong in the lexicon and thinking of silicon valley hopefully his standing in the web community will serve as a rallying cry for right thinking individuals and true visionaries and mean web 2 0 is put in its proper context
807222 laningham you know with web 2 0 a common explanation out there is web 1 0 was about connecting computers and making information available and web 2 is about connecting people and facilitating new kinds of collaboration is that how you see web 2 0 berners lee totally not web 1 0 was all about connecting people it was an interactive space and i think web 2 0 is of course a piece of jargon nobody even knows what it means if web 2 0 for you is blogs and wikis then that is people to people but that was what the web was supposed to be all along and in fact you know this web 2 0 quote it means using the standards which have been produced by all these people working on web 1 0 it means using the document object model it means for html and svg and so on its using http so its building stuff using the web standards plus java script of course so web 2 0 for some people it means moving some of the thinking client side so making it more immediate but the idea of the web as interaction between people is really what the web is that was what it was designed to be as a collaborative space where people can interact now i really like the idea of people building things in hypertext the sort of a common hypertext space to explain what the common understanding is and thus capturing all the ideas which led to a given position i think thats really important and i think that blogs and wikis are two things which are fun i think theyve taken off partly because they do a lot of the management of the navigation for you and allow you to add content yourself but i think there will be a whole lot more things like that to come different sorts of ways in which people will be able to work together the semantic wikis are very interesting these are wikis in which people can add data and then that data can then be surfaced and sliced and diced using all kinds of different semantic web tools so thats why its exciting the way people things are going but i think there are lots of new things in that vein that we have yet to invent

807377 son candidaturas que han contado con un gran respaldo de firmas patrocinadoras y eso nos tiene contentos en algunos casos la ley nos exig a reunir 70 firmas y se juntaron m s de 100 eso habla de un respaldo creciente
807378 penchuleo representa para nosotros un nuevo tipo de liderazgo es un joven mapuche de la zona que ha destacado como dirigente universitario y cuya elecci n como candidato fue producto de un proceso de primarias in dito entre las comunidades de la zona
807379 podemos hacer historia en lautaro existen all cerca de 300 comunidades y los avances que hemos logrado como partido nos tienen optimistas sabemos que tenemos que trabajar duro y el mandato que la gente a entregado a luis es competir para ganar
807380 el pe i mario es un lider tradicional respetado y querido por las comunidades en la zona de freire su trayectoria habla por l y estamos orgullosos de que nos represente en la contienda electoral de octubre
807381 ambas candidaturas se han formalizado bajo la modalidad de independientes y eso nos exige trabajar el doble
807382 lamentablemente el servel aun no nos autoriza iniciar la campa a de firmas para legalizarnos y esto nos ha perjudicado sin embargo estas municipales nos dar n la oportunidad de seguir socializando nuestra propuesta pol tica a nivel de base y preparando el terreno para cuando demos el vamos a la campa a que esperamos sea el segundo semestre
807383 lautaro y freire son comunas de alta poblaci n mapuche y donde est n las bases fundadoras del partido lo que esperamos con estas candidaturas es acrecentar adem s nuestra base de militantes y posicionar a wallmapuwen de cara a nuestra campa a de legalizaci n ambas comunas son emblem ticas para nosotros y esperamos que al igual como sucede hoy con luis penchuleo en lautaro sigan surgiendo desde las comunidades liderazgos j venes que refresquen la pol tica mapuche y constituyan un real aporte a nuestro pueblo

807385 we had a path on friday for a successful outcome on friday night it wasnt perfect but it was delicately balanced and had a strong endorsement
807386 unfortunately a few emerging markets have decided that somehow they want to re balance it in favour of one or another issue
807387 that was a very delicate balance that was struck you pull one thread it threatens to unravel
807388 we will block the wto negotiations if our latest counter proposal is not accepted
807389 who are these 100 countries they india are thriving on a pack of lies
807390 we are not ready to accept a solution that will impose a different balance of rights and obligations than the one we agreed upon in the uruguay round
807391 china is becoming a major problem it is going back on a lot of its promises
807392 a release candidate is fundamentally different from a beta with the exception of a very short list of issues were aware of and working on we think the product is done were looking to enthusiasts developers and it pros to tell us if this build has any critical must fix before we ship issues the real world is much richer than our test environment and i appreciate the feedback that has helped us make the product better
807393 if installation detects a previous version of ie7 it begins uninstall for you so you dont have to dig through add remove programs
807394 weve created this sheet to bring together keyboard shortcuts and directions for common tasks in one easy to access location rather than provide an exhaustive listing of all the ie shortcuts there are a lot we focused on outlining only the ones that perform the most popular actions within the browser
807395 the most interesting part of todays announcement that an ie7 release candidate is now available is the almost complete lack of news no new features a few bug fixes since the last beta release and now the march is on to fix remaining bugs and compatibility problems
807396 internet explorer 7 rc1 is faster more stable and better looking than previous ie 7 betas so its a required update for any users who installed ie 7 beta 3 or earlier
807397 absolutely way way many more websites properly load in ie 7 than do not and microsoft at least deserves some of the credit for that the company has done a terrific job communicating what its doing with the browser and microsoft put ie 7 into protracted beta which facilitated broad testing by many web developers so microsoft has made great strides just not enough to reach the goal
807398 in my opinion its fantastic that the ie team have made so many improvements to the css engine in internet explorer 7 almost all of the rendering bugs ive had to combat in various web designs seem to be fixed and many more bugs i wasnt expecting to be looked at i think the team have done a good job in picking some very common css issues hopefully theyll move on in future releases to even greater compatibility

807404 during the competition i practised in all my free time
807405 it will be the same in the next two months
807406 the pianists were bowled over by the reception they got
807407 that is except for the people that coughed but you get that everywhere
807408 in some competitions they openly put the lists out to show who every judge voted for
807409 i think that would be much more transparent than what goes on here
807410 people now are a lot more visually inclined they want to see people emoting at the keyboard
807411 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
807412 sources close to the situation say the packers are now going to have an open competition for the starting quarterback job so in this election year we have now seen the ultimate flip flop
807413 my theory all along is they should both practice and whoever looks the best when the season starts should start
807414 im a little sick of it but you know its pretty much the only thing thats going on theres really nothing else for anyone to talk about
807415 coach mccarthy will talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly

807424 todos los grandes futbolistas han pasado por estas cosas seguro que volver a ser el de siempre pero ahora hay que ver con tranquilidad lo que vamos a hacer
807425 its a real high working with such cutting edge technology
807426 so much money has been thrown at the challenge of keeping good people in the form of better pay better perks and better training when in the end turnover is mostly a manager issue
807427 it was humiliating sitting at an empty table i knew nothing and no one told me anything
807428 if you work for a jerk you basically want to get him into trouble you dont have your heart and soul in the job
807429 if i failed to recognise this internet scam very few other individuals with less of an e commerce background would have had a chance so i can empathise with others in the same position

807481 the confidence is there i think after a race like that even with the bad result at the end with two laps to go it still counts what we did in the race
807482 we showed a great performance a great pace and great teamwork that is very good for the next races
807483 i think we could have done the race a little bit better but we were stuck behind alonso
807484 i was stuck behind him until the second stop so it was a bit late by that point i had a good car and i was able to catch timo glock but i had to back off in one moment
807485 we were a bit lucky with some of the other guys we have the speed but if we cannot get qualifying fixed then we will have the same problems we have to sort it out
807486 if we can be in front we can fight for wins the guys did a good job but we need to fix the problems and for sure we can be back in the hunt for wins
807487 i think i did the best of the worst if you like in the end
807488 i had no idea about the puncture and the team did a great job to help me back into that race and last year i think i lost the championship because of punctures

807546 ive never been part of the darbari halqas as a matter of fact ive always criticised them
807547 thats why forces like the british east india company came to india to establish trading links we didnt go to them they came to us
807548 in this book i have proved on the basis of primary sources that mr jinnah didnt want the division of india for 40 years of his life he struggled for a united india for 40 years he struggled as a secular and nationalist leader he was a great national leader he was not confined to the muslim community only he left the congress because of the non cooperation and khilafat issues he was against mixing religion with politics thats what gandhi had done by supporting the khilafat movement
807549 congress stand was rigid the congress viewpoint was that the communal issues between muslims and hindus could be solved after independence jinnah said that the issues must be solved prior to independence he said that if the congress could sign the 1925 poona pact with dr ambedkar for dalit rights why did it not negotiate with muslims
807550 indians are not aware of these facts when i wrote the book i thought that people would not be able to digest this viewpoint but surprisingly ive had a great response in my country
807551 partition has had a psychological social and economic impact on people
807552 but the state is making efforts to improve the situation often with the aid of the left the left has made a lot of efforts for muslim uplift and wherever there are left leaning governments in power there are never any anti muslim riots
807553 the economic situation of the new generation of muslims has improved greatly yet we lag far behind in the field of education what is happening is that we muslims are encouraging our sons to take over the family business or learn trades while girls are pursuing higher education this is creating an imbalance were adopting all of societys negative trends but are lax when it comes to education

807621 gerards love of mountain climbing was surpassed only by his love for his family and friends our thoughts are with his long time girlfriend annie in his adopted home of alaska where he lived for the last 11 years
807622 my thoughts today are with the mcdonnell family as they come to terms with their great loss following so closely on their righteous pride and that of the country at gerard becoming the first irish person to scale k2 it is truly heartbreaking that they must now contemplate the loss of a beloved son and brother

807849 sexuality has always been very complicated and when you have to prove it as a matter of life and death you will use any resource you have available to you
807850 during pride we took hundreds of pictures and we have a facebook group and when people sign up to that group we encourage them to show their membership to the irb member
807851 i have used facebook because people put stuff on there about themselves and who they are and in a relationship with
807852 basically its like a jigsaw puzzle and you just try and take the little pieces here and there and you try and construct a larger picture of a persons life
807853 a refugee claimant may not have typical documentation to support their claim
807854 a member of the board can accept any relevant evidence and then assign an appropriate value to that evidence
807855 i do foresee the irb saying this is not an acceptable form of evidence
807856 it becomes a matter of getting a player citizenship in one of the central american countries to become a free agent

807860 the justice department twisted the law and in some cases ignored it altogether in order to permit interrogators to use barbaric methods that the u s once prosecuted as war crimes
807861 specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering
807862 classified august 2002 department of justice doj opinion stating that redacted interrogation techniques including the waterboard do not violate the torture statute
807863 a contemporaneous record shall be created setting forth the nature and duration of each technique employed
807864 while the documents released today do provide more information about the development and implementation of the bush administrations torture policies even a cursory glance at the documents shows that the administration continues to use national security as a shield to protect government officials from embarrassment criticism and possible criminal prosecution

807878 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
807879 or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
807880 the department will not bring the congressional contempt citations before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute mr bolten or ms miers
807881 the department has determined that the noncompliance by mr bolten and ms miers with the judiciary committee subpoenas did not constitute a crime
807882 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
807883 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
807884 the aspect of this lawsuit that is unprecedented is the notion that ms miers is absolutely immune from compelled congressional process the supreme court has reserved absolute immunity for very narrow circumstances involving the presidents personal exposure to suits for money damages based on his official conduct or concerning matters of national security or foreign affairs the executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law
807885 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
807886 the court once again emphasizes the narrow scope of todays decision the court holds only that ms miers and other senior presidential advisors do not have absolute immunity from compelled congressional process in the context of this particular subpoena dispute
807887 there may be some instances where absolute or qualified immunity is appropriate for such advisors but this is not one of them
807888 a limited number of u s attorneys could be targeted for removal and replacement
807889 i asked for a meeting with harriet miers whom i had known since work i had been involved in with the american bar association and she immediately agreed to see me in august of 2006
807890 why would republicans in the state of washington be angry with you
807891 some believed i should convene a federal grand jury and bring innocent people before the grand jury
807892 all of my actions as united states attorney had been coordinated with the department of justice
807893 we look forward to the white house complying with this ruling and to scheduling future hearings with ms miers and other witnesses who have relied on such claims
807894 we hope that the defendants will accept this decision and expect that we will receive relevant documents and call ms miers to testify in september
807895 please advise me by next thursday august 7 when mr rove will comply with the committees subpoena
807896 affirms congress right to investigate executive branch misconduct and rejects as unfounded the white houses view that it is above the law
807897 this administration has consistently attempted to expand the definition of executive power and privilege beyond any possible legitimate constitutional interpretation
807898 the ig will find enough evidence to refer the matter to a special prosecutor
807899 i believe that when the rest of the report drops it will show the civil rights section was compromised in terms of their core historic mission which is representing minorities
807900 i am hearing preliminarily those class of cases were not prosecuted which if true is a remarkable turn of events
807901 he took multiple phone calls from domenici concerning iglesias urging that he be replaced and has admitted that president george w bush spoke with him about the problems with iglesias
807902 gonzales has even admitted that one of the reasons that iglesias was fired was because sen domenici had lost confidence in iglesias
807903 while these allegations are troubling under any analysis a thorough and independent investigation is necessary to determine whether criminal laws have been violated
807904 under the broad language of the federal statute regarding obstruction of justice it would be hard to imagine that corruptly influence would not extend to firing of the united states attorney in the middle of a public corruption case because he lost confidence of a senator who sought to manipulate the indictments for crass political advantage
807905 mcnulty also may have sought to conceal an important phone call from sen domenici regarding u s attorney iglesias instructing then justice department liaison to the white house monica goodling to delete reference to that call from his senate testimony
807906 lam alerted the justice department that fbi agents would at her direction search foggos home in connection with the duke cunningham case and the following day former gonzales chief of staff kyle sampson e mailed the white house from the attorney generals office that we have a real problem with carol lam and urged that she be dismissed at the conclusion of her term
807907 given the wide publicity of the cunningham political corruption case it is reasonable to conclude that gonzales mcnulty sampson and other senior justice department officials were aware of the underlying judicial proceeding being handled by carol lam
807908 there is no way he is going to right this ship thats sinking in five months
807909 the allegation is false i didnt withhold information from the deputy
807910 proceeded to say let me tell you what i can remember and he laid out for me his general recollection of some of the process
807911 he asked me if i had any reaction to his iteration
807912 i havent talked to witnesses because of the fact that i havent wanted to interfere with this investigation and department investigations
807913 i was not involved in seeing any memos was not involved in any discussions about what was going on
807914 i felt nothing was going to happen but i was told that the people who work in those offices are professional career people they are not politicos
807915 this is not going away with a new president the fact that the justice department is the agency that enforces individual rights and they were violating those rights is just a really awful situation what do you do when the watchdog isnt watching but is in fact violating the rights

807936 the newspaper violated the law protecting holy sites several clauses in the penal code and also infringed upon the basic rights of a persons honor and freedom
807937 if no one prevents people from opening notes written at the western wall the wall will turn into a marketplace instead of a place for prayer it is important the maariv understands that it violated the holy status of the western wall every person has the right to write a note based on the knowledge that it wont be read by the public
807938 after the newspaper publishes a notice both in hebrew and in english apologizing for its lack of sensitivity and for its violation of senator obamas privacy and honor
807939 obamas note was published in maariv and other international publications following obamas authorization to make the content of the note public obama submitted a copy of the note to media outlets when he left his hotel in jerusalem
807940 he had his own sense of belief about religion thats the impression i got of him

807965 crew has learned that the white house has now completed its analysis of the missing email problem and confirmed that email is missing for as many as 225 days
807966 in addition the white house is about to begin selecting or has already selected a contractor to restore the missing email although it is crews understanding that the white house does not intend to use backup tapes predating october 2003
807967 it has already been established that e mails for the office of the vice president are missing for a critical week in september 2003 when the department of justice opened an investigation into the leak of valerie plame wilsons convert cia identity despite the obvious relevance of these new facts to the lawsuit the white house has refused crews request that is advise the court of these events and bring transparency to the process
807968 learned that not all email of the office of the vice president and the executive office of the president for certain time periods in 2003 was preserved through the normal archiving process on the white house computer system
807969 frankly i think its pretty clear that the white house doesnt want to acknowledge that yes we have missing email
807970 now we have learned that the white house through its own analysis has confirmed that emails are missing for hundreds of days and is in the process of implementing a recovery plan but as in the past the white house has shrouded its actions in secrecy just as troubling the recovery plan apparently ignores a critical period in 2003 a period that included the decision to go to war in iraq and the justice departments commencement of an investigation into the leak by top white house officials of valerie plame wilsons covert cia identity when the white house refused our request to update the court with these developments and bring transparancy to its processes we asked the court to set a status conference to address these important issues

807974 each of the judges recent rulings in our favor has brought us one step closer to ensuring that the documentary history of this administration is not forever lost
807975 false and appear designed to mislead the court into believing that both discovery and any additional interim relief are unnecessary
807976 the allegedly misleading and false statements were made in response to the courts attempt to determine
807977 as discussed above in greater detail the court has now determined that not all e mails sent or received during the relevant time period are contained on the back up tapes compelling the deposition of ms payton would therefore provide no remedial benefit and is thus unavailable here as a sanction

808083 hes right though rusty all of these people theyre ghosts look at raymond there look at him closely you can see through to the bathroom door on the other side of him the kitchen table behind amy look and you will see it they are a long way from being as solid as they look and trust me you dont want to touch them

808086 well i was just an innocent bystander shot in cold blood
808087 fell down and broke my neck i used to live here
808088 of course theyre ghosts dear anyone can see that i was just wondering what they are all doing here
808089 you might be just a little more i dont know freaked
808090 its not exactly my first time and no i would rather not talk about it in
808091 do you know yet what its going to take to get rid of them i can tell you one thing the church is absolutely worthless when it comes to ghosts not even all that supportive
808092 and about you for that matter what did you do to acquire the menagerie
808093 he would say that it should be called properly by its german term
808094 our friends here need to move on out of this dimension and to whatever after death existence is waiting for them why they are here specifically we dont know there is something about sophie that attracts
808095 this tea party is in your honor if what kitty there is saying is right they need something from you you not just anybody out on the street and you wont be able to get rid of them until they get it
808096 you dont have to make it sound so ominous raymond and i already figured out what needs to be done for him
808097 you said the name was on the saddle then all i need to do for him is make sure the guy is still at that address and then get a package to him that is if i can get it out of the garage downstairs without the landlady seeing me and calling the cops it ought to be pretty simple
808098 i think i have something that needs to be delivered too
808099 so why didnt you people just light in the fedex office
808100 look you just talk among yourselves for a while wherever it is you are when you arent here give me a few minutes to pretend i am still sane all right then i promise everything in my power everything within reason that is i will do what i can to help all of you just give me some time
808101 you stay were having supper like we planned im sorry i can only do one thing at a time that is where i start my brain isnt going to work otherwise and my body isnt all that far from crashing too
808102 this night and the next are the pit of the years days the bowl of darkness it has been called finish what has to be done before midnight tomorrow the door begins to close then if it closes too soon they will be trapped on the side of life again who knows when theyll have another chance
808103 he said something all right only i dont believe we heard him i think it was the same way i hear you talking to yourself
808104 i dont talk to myself you get inside my head cat was that you say something else
808105 they say the devil can quote scripture but i never heard it said about a cat
808106 are you the same cat thats been around all day acting like a regular cat letting me feed you begging wanting your head scratched
808107 i thought i knew all of my past lives but i dont recognize him kind german to testify to my veracity
808108 no there are so many names it seemed best to choose one for us all dont you like it i considered shiva would you prefer that
808109 as much as i want to find out about your talking cat ive got a problem of my own
808110 miss sophie i need to get the saddle back to its owner like i promised it was my word i said id have it ready for him by christmas
808111 it doesnt matter i gave my word and im going to do my best to keep it only only youre going to have to help me
808112 once i find it youre going to have to be my hands
808113 somehow i cant imagine this is going to be simple
808114 you cant do anything for mr satterfield until he finds his what he is looking for
808115 i know youre awake come on get up you cant sleep all day hop up and let the cat out
808116 miss sophie our friend here tells me he is from hawiia
808117 my companion the priest has an interesting sense of humor
808118 we have been discussing matters and decided that among us we have some information that you ought to know
808119 we are not a very good democracy i was chosen to be speaker i guess that will do as a name too it doesnt have the ring of call me esau though does it
808120 i did indeed its right downstairs all weve got to do is open the door and get it out and send it off
808121 that is if you still have the name and if the address is still valid and you have to excuse me if i think this is the bigger if but if we can do it without my winding up in jail for stealing the thing from your sister
808122 aw dont worry about elizabeth if it comes to it you can always tell her about me
808123 yeah like shell believe that please maam dont call the cops im only stealing this saddle because the ghost of your dead brother here told me to what you cant see him why hes standing right behind you making faces at me right now besides that raymond i cant even imagine myself breaking and entering
808124 you wont have to do that the spare key to the side door is right where i left it under the second from the bottom step down there in a magnetic box it didnt take me but one time getting myself locked out and having to wake ben up at three am you can bet money on it being there still
808125 as important as this is to you there are some things sophie needs to know and soon lets go in the other room where its more comfortable
808126 you know how they say ive got some good news and some bad news we have some interesting news and because of our varied pasts we may be of assistance if its any consolation your life should return to normal in a few days
808127 is that the good news that eventually things will stop being bad
808128 ill go on sophie we have been aware of you for days you have been like an movement on the edge of our field of vision never there when we looked always just too far away to find
808129 we thought it was because you had come closer physically that we finally got a fix on you but it was because of the time element instead as it grows closer to the solstice you are becoming more psychically magnetic otto calls it das zusammenstr men der notwendigkeit confluence of need
808130 truth no its a description not an explanation there is power in the open door between the season of night and the season of light and there is power in strong emotion yours are both a beacon illuminating everything around you and a whirlpool sucking up whatever is in your vicinity
808131 our friend raymond here would never have corporealized without your presence he responded to your nearness like one tuning fork vibrating in sympathy to another one already humming
808132 we felt a physical discomfort that could only be relieved by being near you
808133 you know better than that no one here wants to hurt your feelings you ought to be aware that in the next few hours you will probably be having more visitors if i were you i would begin to but my head on straight
808134 it isnt where you are raymonds location was a coincidence that confused us too it is who you are
808135 all right i am the magnet koo koo ka choo whatever i tell you what i am just going to do what i was planning and let whatever is going to happen happen im not going to sit around here waiting i have things to do
808136 elizabeths my little sister we were always close i even used to stop by and visit her and ben but she never did know when i was around so it got kind of disheartening mostly i just sort of hang around here like i used to do when i was alive
808137 no miss just seeing a ghost is all say you wouldnt happen to have a cigarette would you i could sure use a smoke
808138 stay out of my head and no i dont smoke
808139 probably not but i can see things and smell things i could just lean over and breathe it in for a while if i couldnt do anything else it is an awful thing to miss im a winston man myself winston tastes good like a snap snap cigarette should i always did smoke filters no tobacco crumbs in these pearly whites
808140 had something on my mind you might say i fell down and broke my fool neck because of it
808141 you are more like a stage play than a movie little girl you are different
808142 i dont know if you like peanut butter ginger did but she liked anything people were eating
808143 now that is interesting i always thought animals were supposed to be able to see us supernatural phenomenas but i never so much as got a dog to bark at me
808144 i been out visiting thought maybe since you could see me something about me might have changed dropped in on elizabeth but she and ben were sound asleep so i went downtown watched a little tv at the tavern and got my fill of cigarette smokers for a while even went over to the old hickman place
808145 you are no figment of my imagination i wouldnt have you going to a haunted house for fun any more than i would have you buy that thing
808146 now you sound like elizabeth i suspect the truth is that i only gave it to her to pull her leg you should have seen her face trying to come up with polite things to say she knew her decorator would fall into a dead faint over it woman had elizabeth wrapped around her little finger well i wasnt surprised when el gato showed up here when i decided it was time to settle down
808147 i wonder what she did with all my other mess
808148 cant imagine ben would have much use for a saddle i wonder did she sell it
808149 i just figured it out why im still here its because of the saddle i cant move on until i get it delivered
808150 whod figure such a little thing would keep you tied down like that of course i always was a man of my word
808151 still do i love everything about it the people the animals the life i even broke a few bones trying the broncs but that wasnt for me not really there was always an itch that never went away and then one winter down in nogales i met an old indian that taught me leather
808152 he opened up my soul thats the only way to say it when he showed me his art it was like i suddenly knew my place in the universe
808153 i used to customize boots and belts for the cowboys on the circuit
808154 when it seemed like the time had come to settle down i asked elizabeth for this little garage of hers thinking i might use the downstairs for a workshop wound up using this table here all the time and just stored things downstairs had it turned round longways used a card table in the kitchen
808155 so why is a saddle making you a ghost if that is what you are saying
808156 its because i gave my word man gave me a saddle to tool and i said i would get it back to him finished well its a finished job but i never got it back to the man that was something i was going to do the day i died i had it wrapped up to send and ready to call federal express but i got distracted for a while
808157 now i got to do what i promised and get that mans saddle back to him then i can move on i just know it
808158 a sort of multilingual pun which tells you how self consciously literary it is
808159 they break down and have little bit of jazz now and then usually on sunday afternoons but the room is really too small for anything with any brass to it you would like it there i believe
808160 a while ago quite a while now i had a breakdown im not ready to go back yet i was finishing my residency there was a lot of pressure over that and over some other things at the same time my personal life was a wreck all at once everything got to be too much for me and i just shut down
808161 when i started seeing the ghosts i thought it was because i was just over the bend
808162 compared to you i suppose i was fortunate that there were only two on the other hand one of mine was asking me to get revenge for her she came to me to this blithering shell of a human being and told me she wanted me to kill someone for her
808163 no i did what any sane person in the middle of a breakdown would do i went on with my breakdown and ignored her along with anyone else who wasnt me myself and i
808164 eventually her name was eleanor she and sonny both started feeling a little sorry for me irritated frustrated that i was all they had to work with but sad for me and the mess that i was making of what ought to have been a perfectly good life she said that in almost so many words
808165 they helped me in the end and then i was able to help them move on too
808166 when that happened she just for a moment got this glow of comprehension i suppose and she smiled then she was just gone
808167 i wrote an anonymous letter to his girlfriend saying that i was a psychic and that he had sent a message to her that it wasnt hidden in the back yard so she could stop digging and ought to open the boxes of books in the attic instead
808168 sonny was an embezzler he never had a chance to enjoy his ill gotten gains i think that if i were going to be a crook id probably do just as bad a job of it i want some instant gratification
808169 theyre probably standing right here and have been all along only we cant see them i know raymond does that just waits for his moment
808170 i guess i guess shit ill go let the cat in the rest of you can do your trick
808171 up here in the window what are you doing there
808172 of course you are wherever you are is where youre supposed to be it makes perfect sense
808173 you are more than half way in already so i suppose you can the question you really want to ask is may i isnt that right because the two are entirely different
808174 whatever turned you into such a grump of course you could come into the garden if it were mine but it isnt so you probably ought to well you probably ought to get off the wall if you are seen it might not be
808175 oh do you think you could come down here and we could talk its a little difficult shouting up like this
808176 i could come down but down is one thing and out is another entirely you see the door is locked
808177 no no no i am supposed to be here silly it is just the way things are
808178 by that logic if i came inside the wall it would be where i was supposed to be because it would be where i would be
808179 how clever you are you are almost as clever as sophia
808180 no i meant something else it was just a phrase
808181 i knew that its just that so few people stop by to chat that i tend to become a little odd at times the jailer hardly talks at all so its no fun to play with him and sophia is so dreadfully clever and wise
808182 who knows i imagine its just the way its supposed to be thats probably what sophia would say
808183 did you do something wrong did you break some rule or something i dont mean to be nosy i only ask because when you dont know anything well i dont want the same thing happening to me you understand
808184 you hic dont know anything thats so good ill have to tell sophia the next time she comes to see me
808185 i said i didnt know where i was i said i was lost at the beginning
808186 and as to who you are you are an obnoxious child obviously locked away for your own good to keep sensible people from wringing your neck
808187 you arent lost and you know it you know exactly where you are and you know who i am too you just havent listened to me very much lately
808188 this has been a pretty useless little journey for you there are all sorts of adventures you might have had while you were here if you had just once gotten off that path its really very sad you might as well go on back if you arent going to learn anything while youre here
808189 the growing technological and military technology supremacy of the leading overseas countries
808190 concept for the development of the armed forces of the russian federation through 2030
808191 to provide legitimacy for its unilateral actions the west will try to obtain international legal recognition of the north atlantic alliance as a united organization with the right to use force on the basis of the decisions of its own governing organs
808192 considering the continuity of washingtons foreign policy and the content of the long term programs for military construction it can be assumed that military supremacy will be seen in the united states as an important condition for the successful realization of its foreign policy and the american military presence will be preserved in all key regions of the world
808193 the estimation of the military and political state of the world in 2030 made in the new document shows that russia will have to live in world where the u s will still dominate and will try to preserve its world dominance through aggressive methods
808194 the growing technological and military technology supremacy over russia of the leading overseas countries which allows them to outstrip russia in developing means for armed battle of the next generation and to equip their armed forces with them on a mass scale

808289 bekas perdana menteri tun dr mahathir mohamad sendiri sebagai orang yang pernah menjadi presiden umno telah bertindak keluar dari umno kerana telah melihat bahawa umno sudah rosak peliknya ada orang pula yang masuk ke dalam umno
808290 kita jangan melihat perjuangan itu mesti diukur dengan seseorang itu perlu masuk penjara dahulu untuk menyatakan beliau seorang pejuang sebaliknya perjuangan itu dilihat bagaimana kita konsisten dengan apa yang kita katakan tidak kira sewaktu parti berada di atas mahupun di bawah
808291 saya sebenarnya orang yang meraikan perbezaan pendapat kerana ia dibenarkan dalam islam asalkan ia dalam kerangka besar perjuangan kita saya tidak bermusuh dengannya
808292 dalam perkembangan terbaru ini saya orang yang paling gembira kerana isu ini bukannya baru iaitu bila laporan dilaporkan ezam mahu kembali kepada umno saya tak terkejut kerana bukan sahaja saya dah hidu gerak gerinya tetapi ada bukti yang cukup bahawa matlamat akhirnya beliau kembali kepada umno
808293 tun mahathir membayar satu harga yang mahal untuk keluar umno beliau sebagai seorang bekas presiden umno selama 22 tahun dan beliau juga sebagai bekas perdana menteri ini fakta
808294 tetapi keputusan ezam masuk umno ialah keputusan peribadinya saya tidak mahu campur lansung saya fikirkan hanya perkara yang lebih besar perjuangan rakyat adalah lebih penting
808295 jangan ukur semangat perjuangan seseorang itu berapa lama dalam penjara tetapi ukuran pejuang itu ialah dia kena konsisten semasa parti berada dalam keadaan hebat hinggalah ke bawah dan kini keadilan kembali hebat
808296 jangan sokong ketika parti berada di atas tinggalkan ketika di bawah ini saya ingatkan kepada saya dan ahli parti hari ini kita sungguh siungguh kutuk umno tetapi esok kita sokong semula macam mana rakyat nak hormati kita

808304 when jon miller signed his contract it specifically said that upon payout of the contract he could not work for a variety of competitors until march 2009 the non compete in his contract was never waived
808305 we agreed last year that 2008 would be an investment year and we had to improve our financial position considerably in 2009 i want to be very clear the board controlled the process of the microsoft bid we led from the front the 1 priority was to maximize shareholder value that was all we talked about in the 30 odd board meetings we had during that period there was never any doubt to our openness to doing a deal with microsoft nsdq msft we never resisted microsofts proposal despite rumors on the contrary during this period we encouraged microsoft to be even more engaged the result was that they reduced their engagement level and even thought of lowering the bid in an offhand comment to one of the board members they said that there may be a few more dollars on the table it was never communicated formally to the board or came to us in writing
808306 and i tell you folks it was hell of a burden to deal with all these offers we were within our targets in first quarter of 208 we were on target in the second quarter of 2008 their performance was astounding
808307 we are not standing still we are investing in mobile in international markets and thats where the growth is there is no other company on the internet that has these assets and leadership in display advertising we are a major player in search second only to google
808308 we have also been rewiring the company in the last 12 months we invested in performance advertising business with right media and blue lithium the fact that we invested in those businesses is helping us in this economy

808348 in addition given consumers reluctance to pay for music on their phones marketers are finding new opportunities to partner directly with carriers labels and even music artists themselves
808349 marketers will account for a greater proportion of that overall spending as the ad supported model for mobile music gathers steam

808378 we are surprised that the treasury has risked provoking such political opposition for an environmental measure which according to its projections is of limited benefit
808379 that the treasury had not calculated what the impacts of the ved budget changes will be on emissions from second hand cars when this was one of the main objectives of the changes
808380 however we are seriously concerned that even the projected differentials between ved bands remain too small to be effective and in consequence the projected carbon savings are far less than they could be we also believe that both the proposed changes in ved rates and the objectives of ved as an environmental tax have been poorly explained and communicated

808383 if theres anyone here that still believes that vendors are unimportant to the long term success of our projects then its time to lose that delusion vendors are essential even for big institutions and essential for small ones
808384 its startling when a senior leader at a higher institution believes that his her institution needs to have substantial it capacity even to consider participating
808385 thats a statistic that should be on everyones tongues when were talking with institutional leaders many of the institutions had the capacity to implement on their own but chose to work with vendors in order to mitigate the risks of going it alone thats a strategy we can expect to see much more often as time goes by

808781 cant you just make it look like sql if its that close is this just ms wanting to be a pain just for the heck of it
808782 is this some sort of late binding thang where were using refelction to pull out this data
808783 beyond that about dlinq are the queries being remoted amp executed there or is an sql statement is prepared from the expression tree and sent to the database
808784 this new query syntax is in fact just syntactic sugar that uses patterns to transform itself into the exact same c query that i listed above
808785 with linq everything is strongly typed and as far as i can see all projections need to be fully specified if a new property is added to a table the programmer has to find all references to that table and update any projections in any queries it might participate in
808786 will that pattern transforming capability be exposed to the programmer
808787 looking at this i will prefer the traditional sql in stored procedures and access it via ado
808788 re so whats the deal with this whole c 3
808789 is it just me or would the xquery like syntax
808790 will getcustomers return my whole customer table or will it magically select only those i specify in my where clause
808791 will linq support querying something besides ienumerable in the future
808792 hey cyrus a great post in the future would be some details on using lamdas in c i get your example but not having much a lisp background i end up having to re read the code a few times to get my arms around it
808793 anyone how would you write something like this select o customerid c companyname count o orderid numorders from customers c orders o where c companyname like a and o customerid c customerid group by o customerid c companyname
808794 and because this seems like a feature with its own plusses minuses and because it seems like people will want to move back and forth between implicit explicit types depending on the code theyre writing it will make a lot of sense for us to provide user tools for this space
808795 a very great almost anonymous center of people who just want peace
808796 why not simply do without var or let or infer and make type declarations optional
808797 i wonder how the c team will report errors on an anonymous type
808798 since other languages manage just fine without such a declaration why does c need it
808799 obviously you still need the var keyword for anonymous classes

808820 ketika berkonvoi ada kala saya membawa isteri datin seri hamidah khamis dan melalui pengamatan saya tahu ada di antara peserta membawa teman wanita mereka untuk menemankan mereka
808821 walaupun saya tidak menegur mereka secara terang terangan tetapi mereka malu serta serba salah berbuat demikian membawa teman wanita apabila melihat apa yang saya lakukan membawa isteri dan bukannya teman wanita ketika berkonvoi
808822 hasilnya apa yang saya nampak pada sesi konvoi selepas itu adalah mereka yang terbabit sudah mula insaf dengan menunggang berseorangan tanpa ditemani teman wanita
808823 ini yang saya cuba terapkan kepada kakitangan jabatan di bawah seliaan saya iaitu mengikut acuan terkini dalam menjalankan tugas seharian bagi menyampai dan menerangkan dasar berkaitan islam kepada rakyat negara ini
808824 apa juga kaedah tidak penting kerana asalkan ia mencapai sasaran serta tidak melanggar hukum islam ia sudah memadai selain itu mereka yang menerima dakwah itu tidak berasa seperti dipaksa bagi melakukan ibadat
808825 lebih ramai golongan profesional dibawa masuk ke jabatan atau agensi berkaitan islam dalam usaha mengubah imej secara keseluruhannya supaya islam dipandang tinggi dan menerima pengiktirafan pelbagai pihak
808826 sebelum ini orang luar melihat mereka yang terbabit dalam agensi berkaitan islam ini sebagai tidak mempunyai kebolehan tetapi keadaan itu bakal berubah kerana kita sudah mempunyai ramai golongan profesional
808827 dengan penyertaan lebih ramai anggota profesional saya melihat ia bakal memberi kita banyak peluang baik dari segi dakwah atau urus niaga sekali pun kerana wujud keyakinan pihak luar bekerjasama dengan kita
808828 seperti contoh dalam isu berkaitan peraduan 100 hari 100 kereta yang dianjurkan celcom celcom malaysia bhd celcom baru baru ini isu melanggar syariah dan mengandungi unsur judi berjaya diselesaikan dengan cara baik
808829 aduan pengguna yang disiarkan media dibawa kepada pengetahuan kami untuk diambil tindakan pihak celcom dipanggil memberi penjelasan mengenainya sebelum arahan baru dikeluarkan
808830 hasilnya ia berjaya diselesaikan dengan baik tanpa ada sebarang persengketaan antara pihak kerajaan dan swasta ini memberi manfaat kepada orang ramai kerana tidak menerima kesan mengalami kerugian
808831 inilah bentuk kerjasama yang saya mahu dilaksanakan kerana ada kalanya kami terlepas pandang sesuatu perkara teruskanlah membantu kami dengan menjadi mata dan telinga

808840 kami hanya mengikut dan akur dengan keputusan kerajaan negeri tersebut jadi kami tak nak memberi komen kerana takut ia disalahertikan dan menjadi isu besar
808841 perkara itu tidak akan menjadi persoalan kerana fara sendiri akan akur dan mengikut kehendak semua pihak mahupun nescafe sendiri
808842 kita akan akur dengan keadaan itu dan mengikut prosedurnya seperti yang dilakukan oleh negeri kelantan
808843 kita sendiri sudah pergi ke kelantan dan melihat fenomena ini jadi ia tidak mendatangkan apa apa masalah malah bukan kepada fara sahaja kita juga akan akur terhadap semua selebriti hot fm juga
808844 fara pun tiada masalah untuk memakai tudung malah dia suka sebab katanya nampak lebih cantik apabila bertudung
808845 saya tidak membantah peraturan tersebut kerana ia berkait dengan soal pelaksanaan hukum hukum ini sudah ada pada orang islam untuk memelihara martabat wanita islam
808846 dalam masa yang sama saya harap pelaksanaan ini tidak menimbulkan double standard kerana takut hukum itu diperkecilkan
808847 kerajaan negeri kedah yang baru sepatutnya memfokuskan isu isu besar yang boleh memberi kesan kepada kebajikan setiap orang
808848 tudung on billboards are only details mereka boleh fokus tentang perkara itu pada tahun depan apabila keadaan negeri itu telah berjalan lancar dan isu lain diselesaikan

808854 drpizza ive written reference type wrappers to value types and used them intensively for 2 years now
808855 theyre an absolutely essential part of the work i do on a day to day basis
808856 while youre all in the mood to listen to customer feedback why not continue this great effort by listening to the large chunk of feedback given to you about asp
808857 the one thing i like about the nullable types mess is the
808858 drpizza you wont like my answer because weve already established that you dont like nulls in database schemas either but i use them as part of an o r mapping tool to represent database columns that are nullable ints etc
808859 i still believe that null is the right way to represent a situation where there really is no value and that that situation is fairly common
808860 youre correct that for me the stack allocated part is completely irrelevant
808861 i always found that the c c behavior of making referenceness versus valueness part of the variable rather than the value was very confusing and leads to the need for every api to specify how its return value needs to be freed or how long it can live for
808862 i find that the clr and java which does exactly the same thing except the set of value types is hardcoded providing a universal model for this is very valuable
808863 in the java world this is made possible as there is a finite number of value types int boolean etc
808864 the nullable type allows each value type to be treated as a reference type without things like a 4x overhead on some platforms
808865 then if that really matters and its not clear that it does implement them better
808866 however in actual practical coding i dont find that theres any real need for most of the possible combinations
808867 i think most of the combinations are useful and one way or another used
808868 values are routinely used as a kind of non modifiable argument for
808869 its also common that object identity is determined by object value and value semantics work well in this situation consider what happens when you dont have value semantics for such objects youre left with the java situation where people accidentally use on strings and then mysteriously get the wrong answer when one side or the other hasnt been interned
808870 non null pointers are desirable for those situations where object identity is not determined by value equality
808871 occasionally one may want the same semantics identity matters not value but with the addition of nullability unfortunately though this is not the common case normally you dont want a null because you cant do anything with it c makes it so
808872 you do not mention this particular combination but imo that is not so much because it wouldnt be useful but rather because you simply dont have it personally i would find the static elimination of null pointer exceptions useful quite often
808873 and likewise one may occasionally want value semantics with the addition of nullability value matters not identity or
808874 further whether one cares about value or identity is not something which is set in stone so should not be some intrinsic feature of a type
808875 trivially one might wish to compare identity as the first step in an otherwise expensive equality test for example if two array variables refer to the same array then one need not bother with the time consuming task of element wise comparions so conversion from value to reference semantics is desirable
808876 mutability and immutability is another matter entirely there are good reasons to have types that are intrinsically immutable no mechanism to modify values once set to aid in the provision of referential transparency but there are also good reasons to be able to apply it ex post facto as with c s const
808877 certainly there are uses for almost any combination of semantics but the more combinations you support in a language the more complex the language becomes
808878 my take is that being useful in some situations is not enough
808879 sure but as ive said the only value types i care about are immutable ones in which case the only difference between reference and value is performance
808880 notice that c managed to solve this problem without making string a value type
808881 quite apart from the problems of how you could ever create an array of such things
808882 my biggest problem would be that such a concept is only useful if it really does statically eliminate nullreferenceexceptions
808883 i think id sit somewhere in between your position and what c does at a wild guess id say that i want nullability about 50 of the time on both references and values
808884 the only case thats not covered here is if you want identity semantics on something thats normally a value type
808885 it would be nice if arrays had a equals method which did something smart having said that i suspect most people will use list
808886 its definitely hard to get my head around what each of those separate consts means
808887 i dont see this as an entirely separate question from reference versus value though
808888 this code will do something entirely different depending on whether foo is a reference or value type and i find the behavior when its a value type confusing
808889 or at least unexpected in c since most mutable types arent value types
808890 again its not that i cant imagine that there would ever be situations where these semantics would be useful its just that i think those situations are rare enough that the extra complexity and confusion isnt worth it
808891 or equals can mean value comparison or identity comparison and you cant tell which
808892 id prefer the value type to be necessarily immutable and force the programmer to make the copy operation explicit
808893 then the solution to the former is to provide wrappers a la java the need to construct custom value types much less custom value types that one wants to box is small so theres no loss there and the solution to the latter is to make it cheaper to do
808894 oh sorry were chaning everything please take all your code and rewrite it to work in this new system
808895 there was no way to possibly make it so that users would not be bothered with value types
808896 i already said why thats not a solution several posts back
808897 and now instead of forcing wrappers for the infinite value types out there
808898 for many reasons including future plans the idea of forcing users to write wrapper classes value types was compeltely unnacceptable
808899 this solution allows us to coexist with the millions of lines of
808900 oh sorry were chaning everything please take all your code and rewrite it to work in this new system
808901 oh sorry were chaning everything please take all your code and rewrite it to work in this new system
808902 its not clear to me what the argument for not doing this is except that it uses 16 bytes reference 12 bytes boxed int overhead versus 6 or 8 bytes 4 byte int 2 or 4 bytes for the isnull flag
808903 can we provide a solution that works great both when users have crappy code and non crappy code
808904 our solution will only work well if you write good code

809381 sotelco has national global systems for mobile gsm communications which uses 900 mhz and 1800 mhz bands ip telephony and wimax licenses and plans to launch its operations vimpelcom will own 90 of the venture and a local company will hold the remaining 10 percent
809382 this is a great long term opportunity for vimpelcom as mobile penetration in the country is below 20 percent while gdp growth is close to 10 in vietnam the company plans to spend usd267 million to form a joint venture gtel mobile in which vimpelcom will hold a 40 stake
809383 a state run vietnamese company will own the remaining 60 obviously these investments by the company should be viewed as long term plays it is indicative of where growth can be found for years to come vimpelcom remains a buy

809404 wells fargo reported excellent numbers and also hiked their dividend
809405 keep in mind that more write offs will no doubt be reported from the banking sector in the coming quarters
809406 meanwhile wells fargo also surprised everyone by raising its dividend 10
809407 if the companys managers were really worried that spiraling bankruptcies and mortgage delinquencies could seriously affect it they would be hoarding cash by cutting dividends
809408 instead they feel so confident about the companys future earnings they are handing more of the companys earnings over to its owners
809409 another reason we like wells fargo is that one of its major owners is warren buffett
809410 so if the shrewdest investor on the planet thinks wfc is on such a sound financial footing that it can withstand any further bad news in the banking sector and california in particular you should take comfort from this

809438 it also demonstrates the poor level of understanding of the vista os or even oses in general vista is an nt os with a windows subsystem and on top of that you have several new frameworks and technologies there is also the technical advancements that are a part of vista that dont even exist in any other os currently
809439 it does a complicated job so its a complicated os
809440 i can even see ms slowly getting out of the os market and focusing mostly on portable devises and game consoles
809441 sorry apple does not support other applications have a nice day

809471 in terms of the effect he has had on history solzhenitsyn is the dominant writer of the 20th century who else compares orwell koestler and yet when his name comes up now it is more often than not as a freak a monarchist an anti semite a crank a has been
809472 solzhenitsyn is a notable writer but his political views are an embarrassment even to his fellow dissidents
809473 not only would a meeting with the president offend the soviets but it would raise some controversy about solzhenitsyns views of the united states and its allies
809474 we were laughing and agreeing about how we thought solzhenitsyns views on the united states his criticism of the press and all the rest were deeply wrong and on and on

809772 no signore non porto le lenti a contatto come le ho detto non ho problemi di vista ma poi come mai cos certo che li abbia io si fermato alla cassa a pagare li ha appoggiati da qualche parte
809773 non ci sono nemmeno passato dalla cassa io ho solo preso appunti di un congelatore ma di solito tutte quelle che stanno ai banchi si rubano la roba
809774 guardi signore mi dispiace di questa sua opinione ma daltra parte ognuno ha le sue per la invito comunque a continuare la sua ricerca altrove

809781 let me be very clear on this we require the different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and i am adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions
809782 ioc officials negotiated with the chinese so that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
809783 our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
809784 when beijing was awarded the games the ioc required it to provide media with the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games the ioc required this and this is what bocog beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad has said it will deliver

809791 i think youve overpaid for executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome
809792 they can regain my confidence but theyre going to have to prove themselves first
809793 competition is good for the industry and for consumers so i am happy that microsoft did not succeed in acquiring yahoo
809794 yahoo has actively participated in these human rights abuses including the censorship of information and in one case turning over information to the chinese government
809795 i believe you are moral but the only morality you believe in is profit and self interest
809796 he is as some would say a good guy despite the bad things written about him we look forward to him being a productive member of the board
809797 we underestimated the number of firewalls out there that were deployed in front of dns servers

809799 if you have a pat firewall the best thing you can do is look through our document understand how our network is configured and if you need the fix thats provided then install the fix
809800 but at least there are no more deniers out there muddying the waters with the overblown not urgent message
809801 if it cant be fixed with compressed air you might as well replace it
809802 theyre so easily spooked the labor government have such a lack of confidence in themselves
809803 its quite bizarre that theyre reacting in this way theyre getting so excited and so hysterical
809804 peter costello made clear that hes not available for the leadership and that remains the case he did that the day after the election

809835 we had 13 specific audits in qantas engineering last year so we just see this as more of them casa doing their job which is to be the regulator
809836 what theyre doing i think is coming in and doing their job which is to make sure people have utter confidence in the safety of qantas but also the probity of the regulatory system
809837 casa audited qantas generally and qantas engineering specifically a great deal
809838 obviously events like manila where we had the aircraft depressurise they were an entirely different kind of a normal run of business things that are being reported almost daily
809839 firstly our aircraft travel around the globe how you avoid having them touched by foreign hands while you do that is a mystery to me
809840 but the second thing we have 7000 engineers employed in australia two thousand of those are doing heavy maintenance
809841 so that means the vast majority and i mean the vast majority of our work is actually done here in australia and has been for many many years and will continue to be
809842 qantas safety standards are so high and so well recognised that when we do have an accident like the other day with ojk the aircraft in manila its big news and were not afraid of the scrutiny

809853 in survival mode its not quite like the prison years but hes a tough character in a tough spot and hes going to use anything he can to survive
809854 yet these mass murders this desecration and dismemberment of real muslims by other muslims have not prompted a single protest march anywhere in the muslim world and i have not read of a single fatwa issued by any muslim cleric outside iraq condemning these indiscriminate mass murders of iraqi shiites and kurds by these jihadist suicide bombers many of whom according to a washington post report are coming from saudi arabia
809855 religiously if you want to know how the sunni arab world views a shiites being elected leader of iraq for the first time ever think about how whites in alabama would have felt about a black governors being installed there in 1920 some sunnis do not think shiites are authentic muslims and they are indifferent to their brutalization
809856 some sunnis do not think shiites are authentic muslims and they are indifferent to their brutalization
809857 if the arab world its media and its spiritual leaders came out and forcefully and repeatedly condemned those who mount these suicide attacks and if credible sunnis are given their fair share in the iraqi government i am certain a lot of this suicide bombing would stop
809858 i think three people were killed and there are some waiting for the cars to take them to the hospital
809859 i was just going to cross the street but i remembered i should buy the carrots

809864 i cant find a way to report a scanned book in the google repository that has page corruption specifically a hand where text should appear it would be nice to have some kind of link in the browser that specifically says something like report a problem with this book rather than the generic general feedback link

809893 for one thousand years russia has belonged to such a category
809894 a great writer is so to speak a secret government in his country
809895 a man sprouts a tumor and dies how then can a country live that has sprouted camps and exile
809896 suddenly all the professors and engineers turned out to be saboteurs and they believed it or all of lenins old guard were vile renegades and they believed it suddenly all their friends and acquaintances were enemies of the people and they believed it

809913 it will take time for unitarian universalists to mourn and to heal but let me assure you that we will not change our beliefs or compromise our demands for social justice fear will not prevent us from standing on the side of love and we will continue to open our doors and our hearts to all people this sunday just like any other more than one thousand unitarian universalist congregations will be open for business and our business is to welcome the stranger to love our neighbor to nurture the spirits of our people and to help heal our wounded world
809914 as i pondered my theology to inform my feelings and actions i began to realize that fulfillment of my wish total safety and security would mean almost absolute restriction of my daughters freedom
809915 to embrace this theology i had to be willing to acknowledge that i
809916 scary times call for daring people not fearful people the man who gave his life greg mckendry showed us that spirit on sunday i hope we can remember how he lived more than how he died

809922 there was no organized liberal religious response mechanism following tragedy and there needed to be
809923 help them figure out what they need and what comes next
809924 because you dont want to inflict trauma on anyone else who didnt have the same experience
809925 the next phase in which we will identify needs and make a plan for the future
809926 one of the things that was very clear to me and this is pretty common in these circumstances is that there was a veneer of guilt on the part of folks i spoke with around whether they were there or not there
809927 and it is important for us to support them in that process in self agency and in recovery
809928 they were determined that they would have the last word not these tragic events the message that they wanted to send was of their own capacity for resilience of strength and they wanted to send that message not just to the congregation but to the community of knoxville that was inspiring it was not only affirmation of the work they had done but of who these kids were as human beings and as people of faith
809929 the generosity and compassion of every single person in the tvuuc building the care that people took with one another whether they were uus or not and the embrace of the knoxville community was wonderful
809930 i want people to understand how complicated it is to run an operation of this kind
809931 and i want to urge people to make a distinction between preparedness and security its important to be prepared because we cant be promised anything about what will happen next in the world but too often we confuse being prepared with being in lock down as a religious community we have a commitment to keep our hearts and our doors open and to be prepared that someone might take advantage of that but if we dont root ourselves in our commitment to open those doors and to being welcoming and inclusive even in the face of this we fail in one of our primary religious tasks and that undergirds everything we try to do in uutrm to prepare for the worst and remind all of us of who we are at our best

809948 the government stepped in and helped the farmers when they were in trouble
809949 why because the farmers feed america the farmers put food on the table but who do you think delivers that food

809954 someone will get on about trucking someone will get on about the fuel prices then everyone will start arguing and cussing
