7610020 since the twin towers fell historical precedent has become something measured in minutes which only aides in the effectiveness of spin doctoring
7610021 historic as this moment is it does not signify a major victory in the ongoing daily battle
7610022 if obama becomes the president every remaining powerfully felt black grievance and every still deeply etched injustice will be cast out of the realm of polite discourse
7610023 our concern is that well get lost in the shuffle

7610042 a people betrayed the role of the west in rwandas genocide
7610043 french policy towards rwanda had been largely decided by the former president francois mitterrand during his second term
7610044 there were french officers embedded in the elite rwandan army units who would have known i am sure what was happening the public opening of the mitterrand archives shows that he feared what he called a tutsiland would be created in rwanda and once rwanda was lost to anglophone influence that would be a big blow to french credibility on the continent
7610045 i dont see the release of this report as a sort of tit for tat as part of a diplomatic spat its far too serious for that this is a european army being accused of human rights abuses in africa and i think that it needs careful consideration by international human rights groups
7610046 the documents at the ictr also describe a systematic cover up of the crimes in rwanda by the u s government and un personnel including kofi annan beginning in august 1994 and continuing to present
7610047 the rwandan invasion of the congo has led to a 12 year war in which nearly six million have died although little reference is made to this in u

7610076 we understand that some of the news media are more interested in reporting the rumor of controversy than the fact of unity the fact that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory in the fall anyone saying anything else doesnt know what they are talking about
7610077 there may be people on the periphery of both organizations who for whatever reason believe that this is a storyline they want to promote but this is not the case with people who actually matter and that would be sen clinton and sen obama

7610236 any person who knowingly materially misrepresents under this section 1 that material or activity is infringing 2 that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification shall be liable for any damages including costs and attorneys fees incurred by the alleged infringer by any copyright owner or copyright owners authorized licensee or by a service provider who is injured by such misrepresentation as the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it
7610237 universal suggests that copyright owners may lose the ability to respond rapidly to potential infringements if they are required to evaluate fair use prior to issuing takedown notices
7610238 universal also points out that the question of whether a particular use of copyrighted material constitutes fair use is a fact intensive inquiry and that it is difficult for copyright owners to predict whether a court eventually may rule in their favor
7610239 while these concerns are understandable their actual impact likely is overstated
7610240 although there may be cases in which such considerations will arise there are likely to be few in which a copyright owners determination that a particular use is not fair use will meet the requisite standard of subjective bad faith required to prevail in an action for misrepresentation
7610241 in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
7610242 an allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim pursuant to section 512 f of the dmca such an interpretation of the dmca furthers both the purposes of the dmca itself and copyright law in general

7610244 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7610245 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7610246 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7610247 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7610248 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7610249 its sad obviously i feel for her family her friends i think it says something about our society these events are becoming more and more commonplace

7610266 we feel confident that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november
7610267 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7610268 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us
7610269 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message

7610271 our ability to cross promote a premium gaming entertainment and retail destination development and state of the art road course at kansas speedway will attract car clubs not only in the region but from across the country

7610416 our exploration activity this year is very high both on the ncs and internationally the new discoveries illustrate the scope of our exploration efforts which include both known and immature provinces
7610417 the oil discovery at sleipner represents a highlight in this years exploration programme on the ncs and it is encouraging that we now at the start of the big ons event in stavanger may demonstrate that new ideas prove successful in a part of the north sea that has been explored since the 1960s
7610418 this is a very exciting discovery the sleipner area is still very prospective and this well confirms that there is also a good chance of making oil discoveries in this area
7610419 the discovery is a result of focused efforts to find more hydrocarbons that may be phased in to sleipner i will credit my exploration organisation for coming up with the idea that there might be an oil column below the gas at dagny which was discovered 30 years ago
7610420 i am pleased that the result met with our expectations and that dry gas was confirmed in a reservoir with good reservoir qualities

7610438 yeah and regardless of what political affiliation you want to align yourself with this is an issue its real no matter which side you decide to attack it from
7610439 its like honey what do you want to be a pariah what do you want to be crucified its a good thing in this country we dont have to tell anybody its no ones business who we vote for
7610440 weve heard criticism from across the country including representatives of the medical community that mr epps bill as presently drafted could be interpreted as instilling fetal rights let me be clear our government will not reopen the debate on abortion
7610441 for this reason im announcing that the government will introduce legislation that will punish criminals who commit violence against pregnant women but do so in a way that leaves no room for the introduction of fetal rights
7610442 you can also base the tags on lifecycles locations anything and the tagging works for both physical and virtual environments
7610443 for production migrations many customers may find that the capacity planning features greater release support etc that existing partner products such as platespins powerrecon and powerconvert or hps proliant essentials server migration pack offer may be an even better solution but xenconvert makes it easier to get started and is a great solution for many users
7610444 by default orlando uses round robin mode load balancing so both routes will have active traffic on them during normal operation multipathing can be enabled in xencenter or on the command line
7610445 we are naturally aligned with storage vendors because we use the features they build into their products and give users visibility of vms from the storage domain and wherever storage vendors offer management features we use them with xenserver this is the exact opposite of what vmware does
7610446 the storage industry is really fed up with vmware and we are far ahead of them in this area
7610447 citrixs public proclamations that they will fully support hyper v have caused some to question their commitment to xenserver so i understand the concerns
7610448 still citrix has poured a ton of effort into the upcoming xenserver 4 2 and i think the 4 2 release will mark the moment organizations start looking seriously at xenserver for production workloads keep in mind that xenserver has features that hyper v doesnt have today such as live migration

7610506 one more career i probably have to cross off my list is early morning tv or radio show host i got up and did morning joe this morning and the car picked me up at 5
7610507 the bar has been set pretty high i mean barack obamas speech four years ago is probably the best keynote in modern political history democrat or republican i cant remember before that speech as much focus on it
7610508 i think ive got some good material it may not be the soaring rhetoric of sen obama but it is a challenge and also an opportunity
7610509 id say were about 98 percent of the way there
7610510 in terms of the substance of the remarks i told the obama campaign early on that if they wanted a slash and burn contrasting speaker thats not me somebody else would be better suited for that weve had a few back and forths over a word choice here or there but ive actually been very pleasantly surprised that they have not tried to influence more of the speech
7610511 now for those of you who have heard lots of mark warner speeches that may be a mixed blessing
7610512 i feel very good going into tomorrow night that its what i want to say

7610536 we would buy preferred stock subject to significant treasury participation and an attractive yield
7610537 it is a long term call on the common stock
7610538 without such a plan like this shareholders might get zero you want zero or ongoing companies
7610539 common holders will face dilution but it would be down the road with this plan
7610540 the equity is virtually worthless and will continue to be
7610541 if the treasury buys preferred stock though i would assume that would validate that class of equity during any liquidation reprivitization
7610542 the election season and the relatively recent passage of the treasury authorization argue for delay as long as possible

7610566 this latest crisis in indian kashmir must not be used as a pretext for subjecting the press to more violence and obstruction
7610567 journalists must have all the guarantees they need including permanent passes to be able to work freely despite the curfew we also call on the police authorities to investigate the violence by certain elements that have led to injuries in the ranks of the press if no sanctions are adopted the door will be left open for more abuses finally we call for an end to the censorship of local tv stations which is a clear violation of the right of kashmiris to be informed
7610568 due to unavoidable circumstances the print edition of greater kashmir will not be on the stands on 25 august we regret the inconvenience to our readers this was the first time in the past decade that gk staffers could not reach the office due to restrictions

7610572 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
7610573 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
7610574 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
7610575 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
7610576 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
7610577 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
7610578 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
7610579 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
7610580 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
7610581 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
7610582 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
7610583 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
7610584 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
7610585 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
7610586 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
7610587 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
7610588 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
7610589 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
7610590 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
7610591 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
7610592 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
7610593 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
7610594 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
7610595 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
7610596 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
7610597 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
7610598 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
7610599 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
7610600 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done

7610602 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
7610603 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
7610604 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
7610605 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
7610606 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
7610607 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
7610608 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone

7610613 technologies that are in use today including the widely used claus process are more energy and capital intensive
7610614 in addition they also lose the hydrogen in the process instead of capturing the hydrogen from the hydrogen sulfide the claus process ends up converting it into water
7610615 if a pilot plant demonstrates that the process is a major improvement over existing technology and we believe it is it will spur the interest of industries that use a process to separate hydrogen sulfide
7610616 companies will be able to retrofit their facilities with the process technology or construct new plants that incorporate it
7610617 in the meantime we are working with argonne to use the technology for other energy applications such as gas cleanup for integrated gassification combined cycle plants
7610618 we plan to tap our archives and reissue the classic styles with fresh new design details and to build on the brands vintage position with a new brand image
7610619 we believe there is a strong market out there for shoes that combine old school roots with contemporary styling
7610620 i think if they blur the lines too much theyre going to lose some credibility when they really need it theyre going to need it when theres a breaking news event and there are some struggling facts i know im old fashioned but i think the route toward credibility and retaining credibility is to keep those separations there
7610621 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table

7610623 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7610624 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7610625 the amount of work a user must invest in order to find favorable videos in youtube or other video applications is overwhelming

7610647 we feel that the two sides are serious about solving the lingering issues that are being discussed foremost is determination of the june 4 1967 line

7610654 as a runner youre allowed to make contact what doug ruled at second base was even though a j did kind of stick his arm out to make contact was still in his way so a j if he would have turned he wouldnt have been able to continue on to third so after making the throw is no longer in the act of fielding and he cant obstruct the runner

7610673 they the government of sudan want to demolish kalma camp they want to force people to leave
7610674 a message of defiance to the international community we call on the unamid peacekeepers to do their job and defend the idps
7610675 such actions severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection under international humanitarian law
7610676 they the search party tried to resist and there was an exchange of fire between the two sides
7610677 we are still waiting for details of casualties from all sides

7610679 musicians i want to invite to my office christmas party
7610680 surprisingly the median household is just as good as the average professional economist
7610681 im a little surprised because economists are using sophisticated models but the consumers know whats happening with milk prices
7610682 it means economists need to improve their forecasting or at least be a little humble
7610683 inflation expectations are one of the most important factors in the economic environment
7610684 so if consumers lose confidence that could bring us into a bad economic situation
7610685 when theres rising inflation its beneficial to be in debt to purchase real assets because youll pay your debt back with money that wont be worth as much in the future
7610686 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7610687 its fair to say that they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
7610688 the president felt it was important to have the vice president consult with allies in the region on our common security interests
7610689 barack obama has viciously attacked john mccain and his family for being successful and living the american dream
7610690 obama claims he is looking out for our families in an economic downturn but ask yourself this if obama cares so much about your family why doesnt he take care of his own family first
7610691 barack obama lives in this house while his own brother lives in this one
7610692 el pan respeta el derecho de la mujer a decidir sobre su cuerpo pero tambi n se pronuncia por el respeto al derecho a la vida que dentro de ese mismo cuerpo se llegue a gestar

7610694 i have turned a twisted christmas the album into a musical and in 2009 there will be a new twisted sister album which will be a companion piece to go with the existing a twisted christmas album its gonna be old school metal songs that are an addition to the show so the twisted christmas a musical is a combination of the christmas album the new album which will have new metal songs on it and the best of twisted sister throughout history
7610695 he sent it to me in the mail and i pasted it on
7610696 hes taking the armor off because its the end see hes not putting it on
7610697 the thing with those other initiatives is that we have a publishing partner or a partner in the business community that helps contribute to the distribution getting the artists and the financing of the project
7610698 so its not outside the realm of possibility that marvel could do something like that in canada but what is necessary is to find a canadian partner up here be it a distributor or a financial or business partner
7610699 the story after the story after new ways to die
7610700 franklin richards has been aged and de aged and futurized and alternized and heroes rebornerized so many times that you can never tell how old franklin is so its subjective
7610701 through a combination of talent hard work and luck hes found success in the independent market and thats great but hes the exception to the rule
7610702 i want to apologize to you i kept you dead
7610703 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7610704 its reasonable to discuss already today the transdniestr problem i see good chances for solving it
7610705 how dangerous such so called frozen conflicts can be given that the georgian leadership as they say went crazy
7610706 this is a serious warning for us all it is in this context that we should view the question of transdniestr resolution
7610707 it became apparent that those individuals and clients were engaging in prostitution offenses
7610708 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalised an agreement
7610709 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign after 2011
7610710 what i understand is that the iraqi parliament will not pass this agreement
7610711 at this moment the iraqi government and parliament are not ready for such a deal which will face a lot of hurdles
7610712 we cannot sign an agreement unless it will preserve the sovereignty and of iraq
7610713 any foreign soldiers on iraqi soil must have a specific time frame and not be open ended and iraqi blood must be protected and cannot grant full immunity
7610714 we assure you that nothing will be concealed and that we are at the beginning of the restoration of our full rights and sovereignty and the aspirations of the agreement and security arrangement will be presented to the parliament
7610715 its great to be home i have to tell you
7610716 when we were last here i think we were probably on show 20 of this tour and i honestly thought it was going to be a three month tour and here we are two years later you are going to be the recipients of 103 shows experience
7610717 i will say that theres been a little more scrutiny which is a good thing by the members of congress
7610718 sen obama did not become our nominee until about a month ago and the planning for this began i think four years ago
7610719 become part of history become part of democracy participate if they are colorado companies participate in the opportunity that denver has to showcase itself worldwide
7610720 they look objectively and see the benefit of what they want to do whether theyre branding their name branding a product just participating in the democracy just participating in history
7610721 we thought it was incredibly important to be supportive of the dnc of whats happening here in denver and plus having good friends like sen salazar involved in this made it critically important for us to become involved
7610722 die niedrige anzahl der medaillen ist auch ein grund dar ber nachzudenken ob wir in sportarten in denen wir fr her sehr gut waren alles richtig machen

7610725 i cant take a personal check we accept business checks but not personal checks sorry
7610726 look im the majority leader of the state senate ive lived in this house for 30 years and ive never bounced a check
7610727 do you know what that means im a public figure if i bounced a check it would be all over the papers id lose my reputation
7610728 the privacy youre concerned about is largely an illusion all you have to give up is your illusions not any of your privacy
7610729 well people dont expect privacy in their financial information so its no problem
7610730 came out of the box with interoperability the single most critical step to get data
7610731 its been a technology and standards problem but bigger than that a business problem
7610732 google is an example of an application google health is like microsoft word healthvault is more like windows
7610733 even more important it is a platform that connects users to customized information and services provided by health experts and other innovative companies

7610739 coach bruce boudreau really liked him in training camp last season and was very impressed

7610741 a pattern of misleading and questionable practices has emerged from our investigation into home loans

7610756 weve had a number of neighborhood concerns regarding accidents traffic trash and the level of noise
7610757 initiate the process for blocking broad street north of stadium drive
7610758 would force the re routing of through traffic to adjacent city streets including shaftsbury street to the west and birmingham avenue to the east
7610759 theres more traffic on broad now than there was before stadium
7610760 stadium was supposed to redirect traffic but traffic isnt using it

7610768 he had surgery when he was six and hes now eight years old and hes doing fantastic
7610769 this was by far the most successful one weve had
7610770 well first of all i like warner brothers very much
7610771 i was disappointed in the respect that im not sure if the film was being slagged off as much as we got caught up in the zeitgeist of slaggery so it was clearly at some point not about the film and i just dont accept its a bad film i know how to make a film so to say its a bad film to say its constructed badly or anything its just not
7610772 what the next 40 years of technology might look like
7610773 im addressing how we expect to see the gap between human intelligence and machine intelligence close over the next 40 years
7610774 may go exponential in the next few years where technology is literally advancing on a moment by moment basis
7610775 if you are using charge to represent information then cmos is the most efficient architecture
7610776 so our near term focus is on improvements in processing
7610777 the important thing is that all these vertical structures will be on the surface no longer being built in the bulk
7610778 once you are on the surface you could even add iii v materials
7610779 will future electronic devices be charge based like they are today for our cmos technologies or are they going to rely on some other quantum property like spin or might they use some sort of molecular technology where we use molecules to perform the logic function
7610780 gives robotic hands the ability to sense an object before it touches it
7610781 this is the kind of sense that fish have sharks can do it and eels can do it but if we ever had it as humans weve long since lost that capability
7610782 being able to grip is a fundamental ability for humans so our question becomes can we imbue machines with a comparable capability
7610783 we may see new types of sensor modalities such as pretouch coming into widespread use as a result of our attempt to mimic human capabilities
7610784 at 70 percent efficiency we could wirelessly recharge all kinds of electronic devices even laptops just by building coils into work surfaces and then bringing your laptop or other battery powered device into proximity to recharge it
7610785 what if we could build nanoscale devices with a little bit of intelligence and mobility that could assemble themselves into arbitrary shapes imagine a future printing device that you fill up with programmable matter push the button and out comes a complete 3d object capable of movement color change luminescence
7610786 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans program in a serious way to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation
7610787 weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
7610788 an act to increase the width of boats that may be transported on highway routes during the day and night without a permit and to provide for an annual permit as opposed to a single trip permit for oversize boats
7610789 there has got to be an easier way to do this
7610790 tennesseans got another cold reminder of what healthcare costs are doing to the state with the recent announcement that home nursing care for those with the greatest needs will be reduced in tenncare those affected by such cuts have good reason to be angry but it has become obvious that the thrust of that anger should be leveled not so much at government which is struggling greatly to meet healthcare responsibilities but at the costs of the care for those who believe government should pay up at levels that seem to know no bounds the challenge should be to point to the costs look at funds available and say you do it it cant be done thats why yet again the effort should not be on deciding who should pay the outrageous costs of healthcare but to concentrate on ways of reducing those costs
7610791 it was kanyes 1st beat since the passing of his mom
7610792 he said that it was his first beat that hed done since the untimely passing of his mom
7610793 he said it was the first beat that he went in the studio to do i just happened to be the beneficiary of it
7610794 i think its probably one of the hottest beats of the year if not the hottest beat of the year and i appreciate kanye for giving it to me
7610795 a few more surprises that youll be pleased to hear from
7610796 im not going to talk too much opinion wise of how the album is id rather let the music speak for itself
7610797 i started thinking what is the difference in t i the artist now from t i the artist in im serious besides 10 15 million dollars here or there i said well the only thing i can see creatively that has changed is that i used to write lyrics down and now im coming off the top of the head
7610798 it was kanyes 1st beat since the passing of his mom
7610799 this association is consistent with a large number of studies identifying carcinogens in incense smoke
7610800 and given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke from burning incense these findings carry significant
7610801 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7610802 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7610803 any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position and continues to be our position
7610804 there is no agreement until there is an agreement signed
7610805 optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals
7610806 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7610807 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7610808 he stands for the things we worked so hard to achieve

7610820 i am very excited about this new chapter in my life the bright future of telluride and working with an industry leader in ski and snowboard school instruction
7610821 i am truly honored to be joining such a progressive team at an exceptional resort
7610822 we are extremely pleased to have fred rumford join as our new executive director of the telluride ski and snowboard school
7610823 i am impressed with his broad ski industry experience proven leadership and the passion he brings in terms of customer service
7610824 tell me did you sail across the sun did you make it to the milky way to see the lights all faded and that heaven is overrated
7610825 sales volume is starting to increase because prices are collapsing
7610826 when lenders are aggressive enough on pricing especially in certain markets its enough to attract buying interest
7610827 home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time
7610828 still inventory remains high in many parts of the country and will require time to fully absorb
7610829 the troubling thing about this report is that the supply issue is not going away
7610830 it would be okay as long as the inventory went down but there were enough new listings that overall supply rose more than sales
7610831 this report illustrates a housing market thats going to continue to struggle
7610832 needs to affirm the importance of married mothers and fathers
7610833 lupe fiasco x q tip x pharrell x sarah green update
7610834 a lot of people were concerned about like am i gonna do what for example timbaland tells me to do if he wants to tell me to do something that kind of thing
7610835 we didnt really have that relationship it wasnt that type of a process it was more he would bring in a beat an idea i would write to it and sing it and we would move on kind of to the next thing

7610848 were certainly not going to run airplanes on solar energy and get anywhere very fast
7610849 what it does for the industry overall is show what you can actually do with solar show that it is a viable energy source
7610850 there are now people already taking toyota priuses and putting solar on the roof to help recharge the batteries
7610851 its going to take a lot more improvements in efficiency to be able to generate enough power to just do solar in cars but i think itll be something that will supplement what we have in the future
7610852 its best use is stationary applications for electricity generation thats what were going to see its major use for in the near term
7610853 id say paula has less to worry about than randy
7610854 straight up now tell me are going to kick me off the show
7610855 i didnt love it but im not mad at you either
7610856 you were sharp during the first part of the song
7610857 you went atonal on the phrasing of the first line of the bridge
7610858 you sang a minor ninth when it should have been a third

7610863 after more than 20 years together its a significant loss for us we were hoping for a different outcome
7610864 i f you continue with this campaign you obviously dont want me as premier
7610865 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes
7610866 you really need to see a resolution to those three issues or at least some type of clear picture to those issues
7610867 im speechless just trying to comprehend how after all that time on the bike it could come down to a just handful of seconds
7610868 when you consider the distance and difficulty of this race thats pretty exceptional
7610869 we were battling the whole way coming in i thought it would be more about settling into a pace but it wasnt like that at all even at the very end of the race we were still throwing attacks at each other
7610870 i saw his shoulders drop a little and i could tell he was giving a big dig
7610871 i had to chase really hard to get back to his wheel then he went again it was ugly the whole way up that climb
7610872 i tried to sprint for the hole shot but he got there first and then just drilled it
7610873 i think it really helped that he was on a 29er because there were some big holes in there
7610874 i was losing my lines because i was so hand pumped and dizzy
7610875 i couldnt see him anymore and to be honest i thought it was over but then the trail started to get a little more flowy a little more my style and i just started to drill it as hard as i could
7610876 when i saw those i knew he couldnt be that far ahead
7610877 then finally i came into an open section along a fire road and i could see him about 10 seconds up the road i basically did a full on time trial sprint and managed to get back on his wheel when he saw me he just shook his head i think thats when it was finally over
7610878 its pretty satisfying to work that hard for that long and get the win
7610879 today was like a norba national race times two and it came down to the final downhill thats pretty exciting stuff
7610880 i think the saddest thing i learned in that you can pretty much ride a cross country pace for four hours instead of two hours
7610881 he was saying how excited he was to be back in palm springs to see jessicas film
7610882 grabbed her tank top and bra and pulled them down and exposed her breasts
7610883 we found that his actions were more in line with an assault than a sexual battery it didnt appear to be an overt sexual act
7610884 i havent read the paper today or seen the internet
7610885 do we have a quarterback it seems like chris mortensen is making the decision on our quarterback for our football team but nothing has changed

7610888 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7610889 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7610890 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7610891 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7610892 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7610893 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7610894 following the successful feature film paris je taime we are thrilled to present new york i love you 12 filmmakers will direct a short film 5 minutes illustrating the universal theme of encountering love within the five boroughs of new york city
7610895 as i watch whats happening in the liberal leadership he seems to be riding a very clever tour de france sort of race
7610896 hes sitting in behind sheltered from the wind ready to make his move whenever he chooses
7610897 externalities in the classroom how children exposed to domestic violence affect everyones kids
7610898 our findings have important implications for both education and social policy
7610899 first they suggest that policies that change a childs exposure to classmates from troubled families will have important consequences for his or her education outcomes in addition the results also help provide a more complete measure of the social costs of family conflict
7610900 there are many reasons for disruptive classroom behavior domestic violence is one particularly good indicator of a troubled child

7610917 i was just 16 when i met wynton in detroit

7610920 living systems are intrinsically robust against cells dying or being damaged
7610921 the behaviour of most organs is an emerging feature resulting from the interaction of many cells where no cell is particularly robust or even aware of the whole behaviour
7610922 the starting point in winsoc was to provide mathematical models of biological systems and translate them into algorithms to determine how the sensor nodes should interact with each other
7610923 our indian partners have buried sensors in the terrain with the capability of monitoring the humidity and porosity of the terrain and the acceleration forces
7610924 the sensors are then linked to a satellite which gathers the data and conveys them to the control centre
7610925 the first is related to the monitoring of the earth with a system capable of autonomous decisions
7610926 this is particularly important in remote areas where it is difficult to recharge batteries or replace defective nodes
7610927 we believe that cross fertilisation of ideas from biology to engineering and vice versa can provide substantial benefits to both areas

7610936 it is only the british people not the germans or the french
7610937 these people are giving a bad name to their country
7610938 its because of british culture no one can relax so they become inebriated to be the people they want to be

7610940 sung kim last week had very detailed and substantive discussions with his north korean counterpart on the subject of verification
7610941 weve had periodically discussions with the north koreans on this subject and undoubtedly there will be other discussions
7610942 instead of looking for a particular kind of structure we came up with a broader algorithm that is able to look for all of these structures and weigh them against each other
7610943 we think of children as taking in data forming theories and testing those theories with experiments theyre like little scientists
7610944 until now theres been no good computational model for how children can like scientists grasp the underlying global structure of a set of data

7610955 hay alguna selecci n que consigue un gran xito en un momento determinado pero luego desaparece pero espa a siempre est ah
7610956 ha sido un partido muy bonito primero llegar a una final ol mpica es muy dif cil y luego jugar con estados unidos que es un
7610957 solamente cosas de tipo t cnico alguna vez presionar amos todo el campo y no todas las veces porque la no hab a tanta desventaja como para presionar siempre
7610958 si hubi semos metido un triple que se ha ido por poco hubi semos visto que hubiese pasado
7610959 agreg en potencial el t cnico de 61 a os que debut en unos juegos ol mpicos en pek n
7610960 la verdad que era una posibilidad ya hab amos hablado por una parte que no hab a que hacerse demasiadas ilusiones porque si te haces muchas ilusiones de ganar y no puedes igual te vienes abajo
7610961 ten amos estudiadas las dos posibilidades tambi n la de irse abajo y en un momento determinado salir adelante porque para eso ten amos el ejemplo de argentina que el d a anterior que el primer cuarto perd a por mucho y luego remontaron
7610962 a adi el nominado mejor entrenador espa ol del a o en las temporadas 1975 76 1989 90 y 2005 06
7610963 lo primero fue solidarizarse con l y en segundo lugar recuperar los jugadores que hab an roto su ritmo de preparaci n al final de la fase preparatoria en espa a por unas peque as lesiones
7610964 jose era el jugador m s f sico que tenemos para jugar con una selecci n como la de estados unidos igual estoy satisfecho por la puntuaci n de todos los dem s
7610965 es un nime no s lo desde espa a sino de todo el mundo que es un caso excepcional y ha jugado unos juegos fenomenales
7610966 si est s hablando de eso quitas lo que realmente es un xito est s llorando porque no nos han pitado los pasos y realmente creo que tenemos que estar sonriendo porque hemos unos juegos ol mpicos magn ficos
7610967 eso no lo sabemos porque la historia va cambiando a cada momento y vamos a ver como llegan los jugadores para la pr xima ocasi n
7610968 la verdad que es dif cil entrenar a la selecci n en s misma no por el hecho de sustituir a pepu porque ese reto lo ten a totalmente asumido porque lo bien que lo hab a hecho en la selecci n estaba ah y si no lo hac amos bien ahora me iban a caer encima
7610969 siempre es dif cil llevar la selecci n pero tambi n es relativamente f cil porque hay mucho talento

7610974 do i think its a mans world in television that is the most ridiculous question i have been asked all week
7610975 the worst thing you can be in this industry is a middle class white male if any middle class white male i come across says he wants to enter television i say give up all hope theyve no chance
7610976 he lists five women because he couldnt possibly name all the men in positions of power in tv because he would be there all bl dy day
7610977 he talks about middle class white men being a beleaguered species on television
7610978 simple church is not a model it is a research report which provided critical insights into churches which were vibrant and growing as compared with those who were not
7610979 when we analyzed exactly what was going on in the day to day operations of the church some obvious trends and components surfaced
7610980 a process where people are moved forward to become fully devoted disciples of jesus christ
7610981 this is the heart of what the book simple church is all about a simple process that is easy to understand which is embraced by a local congregation
7610982 must have the courage to say no to good ideas which would cause that prevailing vision of the church to be laden with actions which will drag it down
7610983 make many adjustments in my own church since the book came out
7610984 ministry there is challenging because all the pressures of a large world city come together in a part of the world where the gospel can easily be lost
7610985 simply thinking in terms of process is a mammoth shift
7610986 because we as pastors think of programs and purpose seldom do we think of the process which is certain to make or break the way our churches help christians become better disciples of jesus
7610987 they simply want to re work an old statement which they hope will solve all their problems
7610988 go through the difficult time to assess and evaluate what exactly is wrong and what is already in place which is not conformed to the teaching of the bible will forfeit any opportunity to do anything but use people to run programs instead of shaping programs around a process which helps people
7610989 deepen their understanding of the bible and have them out in the world reaching their neighbors and friends in their communities
7610990 that many pastors do not know their own neighbors but they expect the members of their church to be bold witnesses for christ
7610991 weighted too heavily on information and fellowship rather than ministry outside the walls of the church building
7610992 we can never get too much of the bibles teaching into our lives we must work to reach out to others or we will fall prey to the temptation to become part of the christian sub culture
7610993 fosters a smug security for us and confines us away from the world which needs jesus
7610994 too often our lives are programmed to the hilt and very little time is available to creatively attempt to do anything outside of our comfort zone
7610995 to do so would be only to add something else to our already long list of responsibilities
7610996 many things must stop so that better things can be put in place
7610997 you cannot re produce what is not simple and retain the same dna of your church
7610998 to successfully re produce you must have clear processes in place which weight the activities of each disciple toward a careful balance of worship witness and work before the world
7610999 can become ends unto themselves which will then spell death to a vibrant congregation

7611013 most of the doctors and residents out there taking this test know they dont have this auditory skill
7611014 the skill level required to recognize these murmurs is much different than it used to be
7611015 traditional curriculum is that you lecture for a couple hours and maybe play 25 beats of a murmur but the students have never heard enough of each type of murmur to be able to recognize it in a patient or before the boards
7611016 they know they cant recognize these murmurs until they take our course

7611033 again the question is not whether michigan is winnable for john mccain it most certainly is and we have him taking the state about 30 percent of the time but its a matter of whether michigan is close enough to be the tipping point in a close election and with obama leading in each of the last seven polls of the state from six different polling firms that is increasingly uncertain

7611106 essentially we combined two critical messages into one simultaneous priority
7611107 the educational agenda was designed to help corporations and suppliers maximize cost savings and growth opportunities in the current economic environment while raising awareness of the worlds eco structure and social environment and the industrys responsibility to both
7611108 the time has come to set up an industry standard by which we can measure each vendors carbon footprint to enable corporate buyers to make informed purchase decisions
7611109 the process begins by gathering data on your institutions carbon footprint analyzing it to form the basis of a carbon management program which would include a travel emissions management strategy which then becomes the basis for benchmarking future emissions gains or reductions
7611110 trafficking in persons is an issue of public and private concern and private sector companies including those in the corporate travel industry have a key role to play in addressing this challenge the international organization for migration recommends that companies develop a corporate strategy for an anti trafficking policy that permeates all of their activities ensure that their personnel comply with the policy and encourage their business partners including suppliers to do likewise
7611111 specific preventive actions would include raising public awareness and instituting training programmes for personnel to improve identification of and responses to trafficking situations
7611112 specific actions to protect victims may include the provision of skills training employment opportunities and or the allocation of material resources to support their sustainable rehabilitation and reintegration
7611113 the industry can draw several powerful csr conclusions from actes 7th annual asia pacific education conference
7611114 the first is that the industry is outgrowing the offsetting approach to carbon reduction while carbon reduction will always be part of the csr equation the industry is ready for carbon elimination through new fuels new practices and new approaches to sustainability and finally the humane treatment of people is becoming a top priority because people are the ultimate beneficiaries of any csr programme and our greatest resource

7611131 to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole this system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences the apex of the system was to be the bank for international settlements in basel switzerland a private bank owned and controlled by the worlds central banks which were themselves private corporations each central bank sought to dominate its government by its ability to control treasury loans to manipulate foreign exchanges to influence the levels of economic activity in the country and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world

7611133 the benefit of being in texas is we will have positive employment growth somewhere between 1 1 2 and 2 percent we didnt have an over priced housing stock we benefit from significant immigration not just from across the border but from foreign countries sic perhaps a typesetters error like california and florida
7611134 it worries me terribly that theres only one texas educational institution in the top 25 in america and thats rice in houston the economy is brain driven in america and the way brains develop is through education
7611135 we have committed ourselves to do something for which there is a lack of 85 6 trillion in funds which well have to find somewhere to me that is the greatest threat facing america and our overall stability
7611136 when the return on money gets low people take higher risk we had a period where interest rates were low worldwide and the yield curve which is the difference between long term lending rates and short term lending rates was almost nil so what did humans do they did what they always do they went out further and took higher risk now theyre paying for that

7611143 in spite of significant allocations to hedge funds and other high octane alternative investments many endowments and foundations are expected to see flat or negative returns this year according to experts
7611144 before prem on i thought perhaps spice was the tastiest thai in manhattan
7611145 no team has actually played at noon since we started this tournament
7611146 it affected both countries and most players didnt perform to their level because of the heat but we didnt make the rules they said play the game at 12 oclock which i dont think was a good idea
7611147 action by the fda and others is urgently needed to prevent unnecessary deaths and illnesses due to excessive salt in our diet
7611148 we strongly urge that the fda remove salt from the gras list and support efforts to implement a national program to reduce salt consumption
7611149 strongly urges the food and drug administration to examine carefully and thoroughly how its policies can reduce the sodium content of food and to act accordingly
7611150 the amount of salt consumed by americans is a major public health issue as the major source of excess dietary sodium is found in processed foods astho urges the fda to consider ways to encourage food manufacturers to limit the amount of sodium added during food processing
7611151 the fda has the responsibility to ensure the safety of the food supply but has done little with regard to salt
7611152 would save tens of billions of dollars in health care costs
7611153 in the absence of voluntary sodium reduction a regulatory approach would become necessary including the development of a mandatory national warning label system to inform consumers of high sodium content foods
7611154 deep concern about the harm being caused by excessive amounts of sodium in the american diet
7611155 to develop a strategy to support a more healthy diet and save lives
7611156 salt reduction should be a top health priority of our government also i urge the fda to take further steps by implementing the proposals outlined in the cspi petition and improve the diet and health of the american public
7611157 the united kingdoms food standards agency fsa has made sodium reduction a top priority the fsa is also exerting strong pressure on the food and restaurant industries to gradually lower sodium levels by about one third over five years sodium in our food supply should be a top health priority of our government
7611158 is calculated to have reduced the number of strokes and heart attack deaths in the uk by approximately 6 000 a year
7611159 recommended maximum limits of sodium in processed foods must be established and formalized as recommended targets for industry
7611160 review and make recommendations to address excessive salt consumption in the city

7611202 are we happy about mr obama being nominated yes theres no way he has gotten as far as he has gotten except the hand of god be on him
7611203 we havent always used the schooling the opportunities that the government has given us as a people
7611204 some of his policies i dont agree with but thats ok
7611205 i know that theres time to pray and well be praying for barack obama as well as john mccain
7611206 hes for everyone hes for people who want to grow hes for people who want to change
7611207 i feel kind of like hes a second coming hes basically going to finish what martin luther king jr didnt get a chance to do
7611208 many dont see the responsibility amen that will be on his shoulders because he wont be just the president of black folk he will be the president of the united states

7611212 i really cant emphasize enough that im rooting for all of broadcast television this fall
7611213 we all have to take a step back and root for the industry its important for all the networks to get the viewers back get them excited about the programs get them back into the characters and storylines and dynamics that they love
7611214 i wouldnt put too much emphasis on this falls ratings
7611215 the industry cant go back to the way it was before and survive
7611216 so what nbc is going to continue to do is be a little bit more strategic about how we develop programming

7611224 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7611225 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7611226 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies

7611232 theres been a lot of people scare mongering around saying its going to be 120 per cow thats only if youre actually looking for total carbon neutrality then youre talking about those types of figures were actually only talking about less than a dollar per cow type of figure because were only at the inception of the scheme only looking at a small percentage
7611233 carbon townsville is proposing a community based enterprise through which industry and the community can generate and trade carbon credits generated by the large scale use of carbon abatement measures these include soil carbon sequestration in local council parks and gardens and the norths extensive agricultural industries as well as energy efficient practices and uses of renewable energy in business and industry
7611234 revenue generated through the townsville carbon exchange will provide on going funding for sustainability projects in the region
7611235 townsville carbon exchange tcx is a community based regionally focused economically significant carbon exchange venture that will provide wholesale carbon credits to the australian national climate exchange which will be registered on the national environment register tcx is a carbon exchange model in that it works with local industry to develop carbon abatement capacity through various projects tcx will also support local community groups through grants funding and provide the region with significant sustainability based industry opportunities the collaborative partnership between townsville carbon and the townsville carbon exchange is already sequestering carbon through biological methods on farming land and council parklands the area covering will grow from 10 000 hectares to 100 000 hectares in 12 months with the carbon sequestered valued at current prices at 100m the plan will see this grow to over 1b in 3 5 years carbon trading will insulate the nq region from the impacts of emission trading and lay the basis for sustainable agriculture
7611236 the townsville carbon exchange tcx soil carbon program offers an opportunity for regional farmers and other landholders to improve the quality of their soils in a manner that sequesters stores carbon from the atmosphere the amount of carbon sequestration can be calculated and farmers financially rewarded for their involvement in the project tcx has developed processes that enhance soil carbon sequestration and tools for the ongoing measurement of the amount of carbon units stored farmers joining the tcx soil carbon program will sign a contract requiring them to use soil conditioning products and follow an application method that has a track record of successful soil improvement and carbon enrichment while providing better soil structure water holding capacity and soil health farmers who sign the agreement and follow the recommended use of these products will be eligible to claim tcx carbon credits against the sequestration of carbon in their soils how does it work the total soil carbon from a farm following the tcx process is estimated to increase by approximately 1 over a two year term this calculates to a total increase in the volume of soil carbon in the top 15 centimetres at 15 tonnes of carbon per hectare 15 tonnes of sequestered carbon is equal to 55 tonnes of co2 equivalent co2e the farmer is paid for the sequestered carbon minus the brokerage fee part of which isredistributed to community groups via a grants program carbon credits are sold by tcx to financial markets the introductory price for the soil carbon will be 7 50 per tonne co2e or about 412 per hectare a portion of the payment is made at the point of initial sale of the credits and the balance upon the successful completion of the contract term 2 years at the end of two years a final measurement is taken and the farmer or land holder is paid for additional carbon sequestered above the estimated 1 increase
7611237 now through innovative soil stewardship activities and the carbon offsets market through the chicago climate exchange producers are being rewarded for their environmental stewardship

7611339 getting the most from nursing school a guide to becoming a nurse
7611340 i wrote this book because nursing school is extremely challenging for even the most resourceful students

7611342 i believe that helping students who have the potential to become great nurses will not only improve the profession but will also improve the nations healthcare system
7611343 i hope to provide these talented individuals the tools to get the most out of nursing school and to become excellent care providers policy makers educators and researchers

7611359 the power of the executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to the law and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers is in the highest degree odious and is the foundation of all totalitarian government whether nazi or communist

7611382 we do not want our catholic community split into small self enclosed units ever more distant from each other we are one church and as many of us should meet together on a sunday as we can that is the catholic understanding of church that is why we are redrawing the parish boundaries to enable the people of god in this area to come together as one
7611383 locally stores wind energy using a hydraulic accumulator in conventional high pressure pipeline storage banks enabling its use as on demand peak power
7611384 if you choose your components correctly it turns out its possible to store as much as a few hours worth of energy at the side of the turbines how we do that i would leave as a secret for a little while but the notion is that in the end all of what were using are elements of technology already commonly found in alberta its not like weve discovered some new vanadium cell or some speculative thing its a case of using good engineering principles and novel integration
7611385 when you start looking at how much money you spend on the means of energy production versus how much money you spend on storage and how you allocate your capital ratios that interplay lets you effectively put most of the grid on renewable energy

7611418 a pattern of misleading and questionable practices has emerged from our investigation into home loans
7611419 these unfair lending practices may have harmed thousands of people and in turn negatively affected our communities and neighborhoods throughout the state
7611420 im hillary clinton and i did not approve that message

7611429 we have created the customized guide for the democratic convention to give delegates and other visitors the easiest way around town
7611430 every human being is called to solidarity in a world battling between life and death
7611431 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
7611432 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7611433 whether joe biden is as ignorant of what his religion teaches remains to be seen
7611434 which existing supreme court justice would you not have nominated
7611435 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation
7611436 then it can regulate virtually anything and the federal government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers
7611437 every human being is called to solidarity in a world battling between life and death
7611438 i dont just care that the little girl is born
7611439 is she going to be born in poverty is she going to be born with aids because her mom has aids is she going to never get an education

7611443 como primer elemento para avanzar es necesario la toma de control de las operaciones plena y de com n acuerdo con la empresa por el estado
7611444 the way blacks make it is by assuring the comfort of whites in their presence think oprah there is nothing new about obamas schtick this is how blacks have survived for long stretches of american history by being as vigilant as possible against insulting white sensibilities how exhausting for him and tragic for all of us we whites choose the mask and obama has to wear it
7611445 they show them white america that all black people arent in shattered families and that all black people arent underachieving
7611446 that work taught me a fundamental truth that has guided me to this day that change doesnt come from the top down it comes from the bottom up
7611447 not black america or white america not rich america or poor america rural america or urban america but all america
7611448 but somewhere along the way we got off course somewhere along the way we let a reckless few game the system we let special interests tilt the scale and distort the free market
7611449 when urban schools arent giving young people the skills to compete so companies decide to take their business and their jobs elsewhere thats a suburban and ex urban problem too
7611450 so we all have a stake here thats why your opportunity agenda is a compact not a guarantee not a promise but a call to responsibility because we know that government cant solve all our problems and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we should be doing for ourselves raising our kids the right way being good neighbors and good citizens becoming leaders in our industries and communities
7611451 thats why when im president well bring down health care costs by 2 500 for the typical family and prevent insurance companies from discriminating against those who need care most
7611452 support tax credits to help low and middle income americans afford their mortgage payments because if we can bail out the investment banks on wall street who helped create this crisis then we can certainly extend a hand to folks bearing the brunt of it on main street
7611453 is obama the end of black politics new york times
7611454 where and when we enter black women and election 2008
7611455 you said black men should be the heads of their households
7611456 i think you should re read the conversation at my blog because your statement is false i said that in my household there would be one head of household and it would not be me
7611457 we think this way because it is all we know and all weve seen
7611458 the silencing of tracy barker who was raped by state department official
7611459 someone has to protect black children someone has to feed and clothe and develop black children if no one is doing it but us then we have to keep doing it
7611460 i could raise my children by myself too i chose not to
7611461 everything i do in my life is for my children
7611462 pointless plus only one person is in portal not sixty four
7611463 convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant event to occur in europe since the end of communism
7611464 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country
7611465 we needed last weeks rained out points race and a better car
7611466 tony had some good blocks and he had some blocks he needs to work on
7611467 i thought the effort was there and the aggressiveness i think he needs to continue to work on the technique so hell keep working at fullback this week there is great competition there that door is wide open at that spot for guys to continue to compete for
7611468 it is to jason davis aid there he did well when he had opportunities to touch the ball too
7611469 both of those two that is their strength and jed collins had the one in the game before tony did a nice job with the couple chances he had in the game
7611470 the thing tony he continues to try hard hes trying to get a hang of the fullback position hes never played the position before but hes trying to get the hang of it i think he did a pretty good job being that it is his first time out there and hell just continue to improve the longer that he gets to play in that position
7611471 no tenim ni idea de com s possible que una persona la desaparici de la qual ha estat denunciada fa tant temps no fos trobada abans al seu propi apartament

7611479 hawkes bay people know a lot about earthquakes and feel them all the time
7611480 the depth is about 30km which is pretty common for that part of the country had it been shallower like they get in the bay of plenty then you are closer to it and the shaking would have been greater
7611481 how do you protect your children if you do not live with them
7611482 is there room for more love in here ive brought some
7611483 how is it that you can be an advocate for gays and be a christian
7611484 define gay advocate i believe i am an equality advocate perhaps i have misunderstood your observation are you are saying that my commitment to equality and my disdain for injustice and hatred makes me a gay advocate i mean according to your dictionary or are you saying something else
7611485 answers to your questions about transgender individuals and gender identity
7611486 why did they leave us alive and tear out our womb
7611487 just have a little talk with jesus tell him all about your troubles
7611488 if you just give it to them then they dont get violent
7611489 will you tell me how long have you felt this pain
7611490 sister jones has been emotionally ill for a very long time
7611491 some women only know how to speak truth to pain
7611492 as a runner youre allowed to do that what doug ruled at second base was even though a j did kind of stick his arm out to make contact aybar was still in his way so a j if he would have turned he wouldnt have been able to continue on to third so after making the throw aybar is no longer in the act of fielding and he cant obstruct the runner which is what doug ruled happened and in a rundown even though a j was going back to second the rule of obstruction during a rundown is he gets his next advanced base and thats why he was rewarded third base
7611493 even though a j did kind of stick his arm out to make contact aybar was still in his way
7611494 so a j if he would have turned he wouldnt have been able to continue on to third
7611495 so after making the throw aybar is no longer in the act of fielding and he cant obstruct the runner
7611496 if aybars got the ball theres no obstruction you protect the fielder when hes in the act of fielding once that balls released and out of his hand he has to vacate
7611497 why sue them because they refuse to permit you to continue in medical martyrdom because you insist on wearing yourself out
7611498 it reeked of urine no one greets her and staff seemed more concerned about smoke breaks than the residents
7611499 a year ago lynda would have found her own story atrocious unbelievable even

7611503 brian is feeling better particularly better than he did during the game and after the game so its not quite as bad as what we thought
7611504 it wouldnt say i was scared i would say i was frustrated more than anything because i wanted to finish out that last little bit of action with the ones out there and get off the field it was frustrating in that respect its just one of those things that when you have an injury after the game you get a little sore after that it starts feeling a lot better
7611505 i want to make sure i keep my conditioning where it is right now
7611506 im in a pretty good spot im going to do what i need to get back on the field
7611507 ive always said im a practice guy i like to practice i like to put myself in tough situations and practice so that when game time comes the game is hopefully a lot slower than it already is for me im a practice guy and i like to practice
7611508 chris will have an opportunity to get out there as long as he makes it through practice here healthy
7611509 hell have an opportunity to get out and probably play both sides and show what he can do there
7611510 wider spreads on auto loan securities may make it harder for the financing arms of ford motor co general motors corp and chrysler
7611511 yields over benchmark rates on auto loan debt from the automakers lending units has soared to record highs with the spread on aaa rated bonds maturing in three years climbing 35 basis points last week to 240 basis points more than the swap rate according to lehman brothers holdings inc
7611512 historically tight spreads in the abs market have allowed the auto manufacturers to offer attractive financing to both boost auto sales and compete with bank lending at a relatively low cost
7611513 the higher cost to sell debt in the asset backed market makes it more expensive for lenders to fund new loans squeezing auto companies already struggling with slower sales as consumers battered by record gasoline prices abandon the fuel thirsty trucks that provided most of u
7611514 i love that a black woman knows how to hold down the fort with or without a man
7611515 black women can be as mighty as they are gentle as elegant as they are practical
7611516 their resilience black women have such a tough spirit about them
7611517 they are the most beautiful people god has ever created the way they carry themselves is like no other
7611518 sisters have a god given beauty about them they have that swagger that no other woman has or can duplicate
7611519 i love everything from the fullness of their lips to the curves of their body
7611520 i love their curves their hair and their demeanor black women are confident they know what they want and command respect
7611521 every shape size complexion heart and density of a black woman is created in the image of god which makes them all queens
7611522 black women are absolutely beautiful being with a sister always feels like home
7611523 a black woman provides a man with a sense of confidence her compassion
7611524 a sister can let a man open the door for her or pull out her chair while still maintaining her independence
7611525 black women are my complement my attraction to them is just natural
7611526 their ability to understand the daily struggles men go through and comfort them
7611527 when a black woman takes the time to know a black man theres a connection there that cant be broken
7611528 i may have had a bad day but i know that i can get home and lay my head in her lap and she can relate to the things i go through without saying a word
7611529 to know her is to love her her pain her struggles her triumphs and her successes
7611530 there isnt a more beautiful woman in the world i love the way they carry themselves like the queens they are
7611531 whats not to love they are the mother of all civilization
7611532 theres no greater force in the entire universe than a black woman

7611542 ha sido una temporada muy dura pero afortunadamente me siento en buena forma para este abierto estoy preparado f sica y mentalmente aunque repito ha sido una temporada dura con muchos torneos pegados pero esas son las cosas del tenis de alta competici n
7611543 para m nada cambia no pienso en si soy n mero uno o n mero dos esas cosas las dejo fuera
7611544 hombre indudablemente me siento feliz por ser el n mero uno pero s lo estoy disfrutando el momento tengo que hacerlo porque en esta carrera hay momentos malos y buenos ahora estoy en uno bueno pero un a o atr s estaba en un bache
7611545 para m roger es un gran compa ero hemos pasado buenos momentos juntos compartido cenas y otras actividades fuera del tenis pero amigos lo que se dice amigos todav a no lo somos y vaya que no hace tanto que nos conocemos
7611546 el tiene la confianza de haber ganado cuatro veces aqu yo la ilusi n de ganar por primera vez creo que eso empata las cosas
7611547 es obvio que la experiencia de haber ganado cuatro t tulos de us open y la motivaci n que me ha dado la medalla de oro en dobles en pek n me permiten afrontar este torneo con grandes expectativas
7611548 creo que se trata de algo mental s c mo jugar un grand slam s c mo jugar un us open lo que hay que hacer para ganar y esto es una gran ventaja que tengo
7611549 por lo que ha pasado antes y la forma en que rafa nadal est jugando
7611550 siempre lo he pasado bien en nueva york he disfrutado el ambiente del us open pero ahora probablemente necesito un poquito m s de ayuda de los fan ticos especialmente este a o que no he estado jugando bien
7611551 creo que en el equipo hay j venes que est n esperando su oportunidad de jugar en el primer equipo y si esta ocasi n se da creo que no la desaprovechar n pues rendir n igual que cualquiera de nosotros
7611552 sabemos que la eliminatoria ante el san luis ser m s dif cil que la anterior por lo que hemos trabajado para tratar de superarla
7611553 viene algo dif cil porque tenemos que alternar dos competencias ya que viene la copa sudamericana creo que no va a ser f cil el torneo pero todo va a salir bien el equipo tiene una concentraci n absoluta para no tener la desventaja de falta de concentraci n de falta de ritmo para no tener pretextos
7611554 n o chegou nada oficial at o s o paulo mas essa pessoa me ligou para dizer que o hamburgo quer o alex silva
7611555 we dont believe its legal for any hospital to charge anything more than the same rate as a long term care home
7611556 we probably get a call once a day on this from somewhere in the province
7611557 como se pode ver a confiabilidade a chave da temporada e terminar na zona de pontua o o objetivo de todos mas eu n o estou preocupado com a confiabilidade do meu carro n o tivemos nenhum problema

7611606 but one reason influencing some christians may be what pope john paul
7611607 successive decisions which have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools these and other decisions have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project

7611628 i got in touch with the garda because the person using my name and photo next to these sick messages is using a server in dublin
7611629 i feel totally violated and angry that my profile can be used in this

7611634 the recent announcements to teams and riders at vir by ama pro racing confirming the use of the new turns 12 and 4 as well as racing in the rain are very positive for our fans
7611635 the two new sections of track in turn 12 and turn 4 were created this year specifically to benefit the pro motorcycle events and offer better sight lines from existing fan areas and altogether new viewing camping areas
7611636 weve spent millions over the last two years to preserve and benefit the top levels of motorcycle racing at road atlanta and i am glad that our fans will get to see it in action
7611637 additionally ama pros commitment to run rain or shine is a great relief to our fans who now know that they will see racing even if there is a little inclement weather thus removing any concerns about the day being spoiled by a few showers
7611638 the recent announcements about the potential dissolution of superbike racing as we know it currently from ama pro racing next year along with some of the top riders potentially moving to european racing suggest that this may be the last chance to see this show in its current form these bikes and these stars under the ama pro banner
7611639 we expect to have exceptional racing in the future and are exploring our options but it seems certain that it will be different than what we know now
7611640 hence we feel confident that this will be a year to remember for all of our fans i wouldnt want to miss it myself
7611641 what if we tried something radical what if we decided that tomorrow you would focus on the best decisions for you and not discuss your mistakes anymore what if every day you decided to make

7611653 john conway and simon kochen claim to have proven that if humans have even the tiniest amount of free will then atoms themselves must also behave unpredictably
7611654 but gerardt hooft of the university of utrecht in the netherlands who won the nobel prize in physics in 1999 says the pairs conclusions are legitimate but he chooses determinism over free will
7611655 as a determined determinist i would say that yes you bet an experimenters choice what to measure was fixed from the dawn of time and so were the properties of the thing he decided to call a photon
7611656 if you believe in determinism you have to believe it all the way no escape possible conway and kochen have shown here in a beautiful way that a half hearted belief in pseudo determinism is impossible to sustain

7612110 look i have to admit that like most guys i have my slightly perverted side we all have little things that excite us and in my case i have a bit of a hing for pantyhose and high heels always have had as long as i can remember and of course i see you a lot and i cant help but take notice of what you e wearing especially when it comes to what turns me on
7612111 that would explain why apart from all the girls you were the only guy who ever commented on when i was wearing new stuff especially shoes then
7612112 anyway i knew it was wrong but with you away i couldn resist taking a look in your wardrobe at first it was just a look but then the desire to try them on overtook me and i suppose i just lost myself in the moment and well here we are
7612113 i assume you think im some sort of ultra strange pervert now and maybe i am but you e an attractive girl and combine that with the attraction i felt to your hings well i couldn help myself ill just take this stuff off and go
7612114 look don worry i had always noticed that you took more notice of me than maybe you should have but now i understand a little more its no big deal and to be honest it actually turns me on a little
7612115 i know this is wrong for both of us and you need to understand that this is strictly a one off thing but i desperately want to fuck you right now i want to have some fun because this is something we may never get a chance to do again you don need to worry this is our secret i might ask you to do some things that you might not like even but today is a time for experiments so just go with me and enjoy

7612159 its hard to believe that a councillor has been charged with such a serious offence and we will have to wait and see what happens
7612160 this is one race of people for whom psychoanalysis is of no use whatsoever
7612161 he is obviously innocent until proven guilty and we will be taking an interest in the case

7612171 la puesta a disposici n de la conselleria para usos industriales relacionadas con la empresa fgv de 70 000 metros cuadrados de suelo calificado como no urbanizable que adem s es suelo de huerta
7612172 entre la puesta en marcha del plan de acci n territorial de protecci n de la huerta elaborado por medio ambiente y la pretensi n de reservar 70 000 metros cuadrados de suelo de la mejor huerta de burjassot existe una evidente contradicci n
7612173 no se puede pretender defender la huerta y al mismo tiempo ir eliminando suelo protegido de huerta a no ser que la protecci n que pretende el pp sea protegerlo bajo una capa de asfalto y cemento
7612174 tomar cartas en el asunto o ser c mplice de quien denigra a la democracia con sus comportamientos e insultos
7612175 fabra ha demostrado que ni tiene educaci n ni comportamiento c vico y nicamente se rige por sus principios del esp ritu nacional franquista
7612176 vuelva a las aulas a cursar la asignatura de ciudadan a para ver si aprende lo que es la convivencia y el respeto democr tico y el respeto a la ley
7612177 el modelo del pp en la comunitat valenciana recuerda a otros tiempos y si este es el modelo de camps que lo diga porque l es el responsable de su partido
7612178 resulta incre ble que el presidente del pp mariano rajoy defendiera este verano la honorabilidad de fabra cuando est imputado por delito fiscal y que en cualquier sistema democr tico hace tiempo que habr a sido cesado o dimitido
7612179 los insultos de fabra y su permanente burla a la justicia y la democracia esta es la gota que ha colmado todas nuestras paciencias y exigimos a camps que cese a fabra o que asuma su responsabilidad en la connivencia con un imputado al que protege y da cobertura pol tica en el pp
7612180 necesidad urgente de un cambio substancial en el comportamiento del equipo de gobierno de la diputaci n de castell n
7612181 el grupo socialista ha denunciado reiteradamente que la manera de actuar del presidente de la instituci n provincial supone un claro desprecio a las formas democr ticas todos hemos podido ver como el presidente insultaba al portavoz del grupo socialista al finalizar el ltimo pleno de la instituci n celebrado el pasado mes de julio
7612182 constituye un claro ejemplo de los malos modales de los que continuamente hace gala el se or fabra y que venimos denunciando desde hace tiempo
7612183 el continuo recurso a la descalificaci n personal por parte de los diputados del pp pone de manifiesto la falta de argumentos para rebatir las intervenciones y causas respetables que la oposici n defiende est claro que la argumentaci n de francisco colomer es notoriamente superior y es muy posible que este hecho desate los instintos m s bajos de los se ores y se oras del partido popular que se acogen al insulto como principal tesis
7612184 se acabe ya esta manera de hacer pol tica este intolerable ataque permanente que supera con creces los l mites m nimos del respeto
7612185 fabra alardea continuamente de que su partido ostenta la mayor a absoluta de la diputaci n sin embargo deber a saber que este hecho no le acredita a actuar de la manera que lo hace
7612186 esa mayor a fruto del ejercicio democr tico se deslegitima cada vez que el presidente de la diputaci n no respeta las opiniones de los dem s puesto que el resto de grupos representan las ideas y voluntades de un amplio sector de la ciudadan a que tambi n les ha elegido democr ticamente
7612187 la prepotencia del se or fabra se refleja sobre todo en los plenos donde adem s de escuchar sus insultos tenemos que presenciar como el resto de diputados de su partido le r en las
7612188 un reglamento que garantice la ecuanimidad el respeto y los modales democr ticos
7612189 es necesario superar las continuas arbitrariedades en la conducci n de las sesiones no hay que olvidar que la calidad democr tica es el objetivo esencial de la convivencia plural y de la madurez de las instituciones

7612337 yesterday afternoon i saw the man next door doing target practice against some kind of shooting board in his back garden with an air rifle
7612338 i asked him if he was with a club and he said he was
7612339 i have to admit i wasnt very happy at this going on next door to me because it made a loud clacking noise and i dont like having guns so nearby
7612340 the police have been to question all the neighbours i saw the ambulance arrive and that was the first i heard about it
7612341 i saw the family quite often and they are quite quiet
7612342 the rumour is that it was the little girl one of his sisters who pulled the trigger by accident
7612343 i heard the father was cleaning the rifle when he got a phone call
7612344 one of the children got hold of the gun and thats when the accident happened
7612345 they cannot operate on the boy until he comes round in hospital because i have heard the bullet from the air rifle is lodged in the back of his head
7612346 i think the boy is still critical in hospital we dont know whether he is going to live or die
7612347 they are a nice family and love their children very much the little boy who was shot was a lovely boy
7612348 the toddler was playing with other young children in the garden when he sustained a pellet wound to the back of the head from an air weapon
7612349 a strong line of inquiry is that young children aged under five somehow managed to access the air weapon and accidentally caused it to go off
7612350 while we are still trying to establish precisely what happened this does appear to be a tragic accident involving young children
7612351 there are no words to describe it really the whole road loves them
7612352 he was target practising with the gun and then somebody rang his mobile the gun was ready to fire and he answered the phone
7612353 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
7612354 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7612355 here is what the catechism of the catholic church says human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
7612356 whether joe biden is as ignorant of what his religion teaches remains to be seen
7612357 so there we have it the man running for president on the democratic ticket supports selective infanticide his running mate is a pro abortion catholic the delegates are wildly out of step with americans on abortion and the speaker of the house hasnt a clue what her religion teaches on the subject
7612358 lol you guys didnt see it coming straight at you
7612359 i think it recognises the importance of her race of 18 million people voting for her
7612360 he is going to have to reinforce his capacity for leadership
7612361 we will be looking for cues in what she says
7612362 the last few times she expressed support for obama people picked up that she still wants delegates to fight for her
7612363 my sense is that we will lose hundreds of delegates
7612364 i think after the election many of her supporters female and male were in mourning
7612365 you will see many women in the barack administration i know they are reaching out and compiling lists of competent women
7612366 im not very keen im not going to raise funds im not going to phone bank for him but i will vote

7612380 i think there is a new kind of satire thats coming out it isnt necessarily targeted at individuals but rather at the system which people seem rather tired of
7612381 its almost like the politicians are second guessing the jokes that the comedians are going to do
7612382 i think were going to see a lot of that satire on the fringe next year
7612383 compared with the two other olympics ive taken part in the food at the beijing games was the tastiest

7612391 i wrote out an outline of a strategic plan that would include our mission and objectives to keep the team focused
7612392 once i was finished with my rough strategic plan i gave it to angela wells whose editorial skills polished it up to present it to the hood to coast management team and then to potential sponsors
7612393 they were receptive to the idea and very helpful we were able to get a number of companies to sponsor our team in different ways
7612394 they loved our proposal and have since been extremely supportive of our cause

7612399 this system should track northwestward and potentially track over southwestern or western haiti late tuesday night or early wednesday morning as a 60 mph tropical storm this system may then track into the southeastern and central bahamas during thursday by friday this system may be tracking slowly northwestward across the central and northwestern bahamas as a strong tropical storm or category 1 hurricane
7612400 this system needs to be watched very closely as it poses a threat to hispaniola jamaica eastern cuba and the southeastern bahamas this system also will need to be watched closely along the entire u s coastline as its exact forecast track is uncertain at this point
7612401 development if any is expected to be slow to occur
7612402 nobody in the world knows barack obama better than his wife michelle
7612403 she herself also embodies a very american story she was raised on the south side of chicago in a middle class home
7612404 her personal perspective and what she offers will i think be very compelling to the american public
7612405 tonight will be an opportunity for the american people to be introduced to senator obama once again to learn about his values from people who know him best

7612410 er ist ein unbeherrschter charakter der sich nicht im griff hat und damit sich und der mannschaft keinen gefallen tut
7612411 das problem dabei ist dass er die schiedsrichter mit seinen aktionen grunds tzlich gegen sich aufbringt deshalb sei die spielf hrer wahl auch problematisch philipp lahm w re sicherlich der bessere kapit n gewesen weil er als fairer und sauberer sportsmann einen ganz anderen stellenwert bei den schiedsrichtern hat

7612413 a actual escalada do conflito o resultado tr gico de um confronto de muito s culos entre os povos que vivem na regi o c ucaso que os dirigentes da ge rgia nem os passados nem os actuais n o souberam superar
7612414 n o podem ter quaisquer consequ ncias jur dicas para a ge rgia
7612415 poder ter consequ ncias pesad ssimas para a pr pria r ssia
7612416 desse modo a r ssia isola se ainda mais da comunidade internacional viola grosseiramente o acordo assinado por medvedev e saakachvili tendo como intermedi rio o presidente de fran a e instala uma mina de ac o retardada para as as suas autonomias
7612417 a r ssia deve reconhecer a independ ncia da oss tia do sul e da abkh zia para assinar com elas acordos jur dicos internacionais v lidos sobre a perman ncia das nossas tropas nesses territ rios
7612418 agora necess rio decidir uma tarefa pr tica como garantir a seguran a da r ssia da abkh zia e da oss tia do sul no c caso o nico instrumento s o as for as armadas e isto predeterminar tudo

7612421 the presence of the international community in afghanistan must be reviewed through a mutual agreement
7612422 the authorities and responsibilities of the international forces in afghanistan must be regulated through a status of force agreement consistent with both international and afghan laws
7612423 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians must be stopped
7612424 unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7612425 we have decided to quit the coalition and sit on the opposition benches in parliament
7612426 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled
7612427 the ppp also violated the latest agreement reached earlier this month that the judges will be restored 24 hours after the resignation of musharraf

7612430 we have requested saeed uz zaman siddiqui to accept our offer to become presidential candidate

7612438 i am asking you to those of you who supported me i will be forever grateful to work as hard for barack obama as you worked for me during the primary
7612439 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumor of controversy than the fact of unity
7612440 the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so
7612441 senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall
7612442 anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7612443 barack obamas story is an american story that reflects a life of struggle opportunity and responsibility like those faced by americans everyday
7612444 the opening night of the convention will highlight baracks life story his commitment to change and the voices of americans who are calling for a new direction for this country
7612445 dont vote for barack because you think hes cute or because you like his smile

7612461 it was maybe an opportunity missed for the chinese to demonstrate their willingness to be more open and to allow more freedom of speech freedom of religion while the world was watching
7612462 so i would say perhaps were disappointed that they didnt take the full opportunity that was offered to them while the world was watching during these olympics
7612463 we think our relationship with china has had a positive impact on freedom and human rights in china
7612464 we would like to see more liberalization of human rights and religious freedom
7612465 brad and angelina dont give a f k what the world thinks of how theyre raising their kids
7612466 dick was escorted back to the holding area at one point i noticed dick sat up from the floor and his pants were soaked from the waist area to the ankles dick has just urinated on himself
7612467 public comments serve a broader purpose than just trying to alter the administrations opinion
7612468 try not to become a man woman of success but rather try to become a man woman of value
7612469 obviously this is not the way you want it to happen but its an opportunity for a lot of guys and i am one of the guys
7612470 as more filipino health professionals migrate to developed countries we lose the most educated the most skilled the ones with the highest potential to improve the health of the country
7612471 migration of health professionals as opportunity for improving the philippine health system
7612472 the volume of returnees is relatively small compared to the outflow of professionals
7612473 in the philippines you will start from a very low minimum monthly salary unlike if you work in the us or in the uk
7612474 some of them even gained the opportunity to bring their immediate families to the countries where they worked children get the opportunity to be educated in a developed country and consequently become a member of a society with better opportunities for growth than in the philippines
7612475 it is what the common juana would endure when she has to cue for hours at the nearest health center in order to have her youngest child vaccinated because not enough health staff is available
7612476 consequently drained medical and paramedical staff for municipal and barangay health centers
7612477 suffering economy and from a large deficit plagued by massive foreign borrowing
7612478 with the billions of dollars in remittances saving the economy from collapse the government does not have the temerity to reverse the practice of manpower export
7612479 so the brain drain dilemma has been taken in stride seen only as a chronic problem to which there is no known solution
7612480 seemed to stem from the inability of the government to match the salaries offered by hospitals clinics and centers abroad
7612481 the strategy to mitigate brain drain then is to bring foreign money to the country
7612482 medical translation and medical transcription is not likely to be exciting enough for a person whose passion is actually heart surgery
7612483 to compete for the estimated us 188 b that will be spent on the industry worldwide by 2013 the government has reportedly had initial talks with countries like russia romania poland italy and france on medical tourism services
7612484 the governments response to the exodus is to mass produce doctors and nurses with the distorted hope that mere numbers will replace the quality lost
7612485 this could spell doom to a country aiming to build confidence for medical tourism
7612486 what has remained unresolved is the issue of medical quality and health service what we failed to acknowledge in that desperate housewives episode was the hint of truth in that statement and that a proportion of these so called professionals educated and trained in the philippines may not be as competent as we hope they would be
7612487 the government should be asking itself if remittances compensate enough for the loss of the best trained professionals in the health system bearing in mind that these individuals often ends up settling abroad and consequently had no reason to send money back to the philippines
7612488 an example of such programs includes the balikbayan program of the marcos regime a new idea would be the returning experts program of the center for international migration and development and programs like those in india that has resulted in what they call a brain gain
7612489 the philippines need to develop a national program that will not only invite filipinos abroad to come home occasionally and render a few medical missions but to entice them to stay on and actually work in the country
7612490 if the country keeps on losing the best the brightest the most talented the most skilled it has to confront the prospect of a good predominantly mediocre manpower whether in the service or in the teaching sector of the profession
7612491 the best would be largely limited to imperial manila and the situation in the countryside bad as it is already would only become worse
7612492 hybrid models that shift from gasoline fuel to electric power at the touch of a button
7612493 we should remember the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain is a minority versus majority issue and if it would always be the tyranny of the majority that would be imposed the aspirations of the minority would never be realized

7612507 the management companies will immediately open them up for public use
7612508 we cant expect in the short term all the investment will be regained right away du said
7612509 if we rely only on swimming pool tickets we certainly will lose money kang wei a deputy manager of the government company that owns the pool said in comments on the beijing organizers web site
7612510 so we will have other products to guarantee the operation in the long run

7612521 we have enough problems with them as it is putting sebelius on the bottom of the ticket would have been another stick in the eye
7612522 i think their lack of supreme confidence is reflected in the biden choice

7612530 the elder stevens squandered his 40 years in congress over 250 000 worth of home improvements including a new first floor for his house which was raised up on stilts to accommodate it a garage wrap around deck plumbing and electricity furniture and an outdoor viking grill

7612560 a round figure of a d 1000 has often been assumed for the beginning of the migration

7612563 tokyo is a shining star in the world of cuisine
7612564 we found the citys restaurants to be excellent featuring the best ingredients culinary talents and a tradition passed on from generation to generation and refined by todays chefs
7612565 there are a lot of great cities in the world
7612566 tokyo is an exciting place to eat but paris is an exciting place to eat so is rome
7612567 i dont think it is helpful to make that kind of statement
7612568 tokyo has the best japanese food in the world but it is nowhere near as diverse as other cities
7612569 tokyo ii mise umai mise tokyo good restaurant delicious restaurant
7612570 i think we can call it the culinary capital of the world

7612587 somos no final das contas todos democratas ainda que isso leve algum tempo
7612588 n o somos um partido da ordem unida somos diferentes uns dos outros mas n o se enganem somos unidos
7612589 eu quero apenas deixar isto totalmente claro n o podemos arcar com mais quatro anos das pol ticas falidas do presidente bush
7612590 estou ansiosa para estar presente na casa branca quando o presidente obama assinar uma lei que crie um sistema de sa de barato e de qualidade para todos os norte americanos
7612591 eu sou hillary clinton e eu n o aprovo aquela mensagem
7612592 preocupo me com a possibilidade de que haja um segmento da popula o que talvez encontremos mais dificuldades para atingir cidad os comuns que dir o calma l estamos a ponto de ter um presidente negro
7612593 esse o perigo o de que venhamos a declarar vit ria
7612594 por mais hist rico que seja o momento que estamos vivendo n o significa que estejamos conquistando uma grande vit ria nessa batalha corrente cotidiana
7612595 caso obama venha a se tornar presidente todas as queixas que os negros norte americanos ainda sentem profundamente e todas as injusti as que est o gravadas em suas consci ncias ser o exclu das do reino do debate polido
7612596 existe uma suposi o de que agora n s enfim chegamos l
7612597 nossa preocupa o que os problemas que ainda enfrentamos se percam em meio agita o
7612598 as pessoas sentem que existe algo de insens vel de indiferente aos problemas raciais em admitir o fato de que efetivamente avan amos muito nas ltimas d cadas
7612599 mas n o importa que ele ven a ou perca o fato de que um negro se tenha tornado o candidato de um dos dois grandes partidos diz alguma coisa sobre o pa s
7612600 diz q eu a estrada que come amos a percorrer em 1965 com a lei de garantia aos direitos eleitorais chegou ao fim agora n o precisamos mais falar de cidad os privados de seus direitos de express o pol tica como faz amos no passado
7612601 alguns poucos dos meus amigos brancos me perguntaram se agora que barack est conseguindo tudo que conseguiu estaremos em posi o de enfim deixar para tr s a quest o racial
7612602 espero que as pessoas de mentalidade progressista n o cheguem a uma conclus o gen rica de que porque barack conseguiu sucesso todos os demais negros poder o faz lo
7612603 jamais fui ing nuo a ponto de acreditar que poderemos superar nossas divis es raciais em uma nica elei o ou com uma nica candidatura especialmente uma candidatura imperfeita como a minha
7612604 ele est disputando a presid ncia dos estados unidos n o a presid ncia da liga urbana uma organiza o que combate a pobreza das minorias raciais em reas urbanas deterioradas
7612605 creio que a maioria das pessoas compreenda que ele n o pode sair em p blico defendendo uma agenda pol tica abertamente negra
7612606 so there are some feelings in there scooters a darling when youre on his good side
7612607 my brain just goes on a tangent and then there are other things to think about and then it all gets put into this huge list
7612608 mammals can smell fear and they wont let you near them if youre afraid of them
7612609 eu votarei em mccain porque um candidato que est pronto para ser presidente desde o primeiro dia

7612611 obama n o est qualificado para ser presidente e al m disso esqueceu os latinos hillary estava capacitada para ser presidente desde o primeiro dia
7612612 a muitos democratas que apoiaram a senadora e votar o
7612613 uma vergonha o fato de o governo dos eua n o ter conseguido fazer o congresso aprovar esse documento naquela poca
7612614 caso se levem em conta os acontecimentos recentes improv vel que o congresso o aprove ent o a fim de evitar que seja bloqueado seria adequado retir lo da pauta e permitir que o documento seja analisado pelo novo governo
7612615 a quest o do uso pac fico da energia nuclear n o deveria depender da situa o pol tica atual
7612616 acho que se trata de uma falta grave de uma tentativa de mudar as fronteiras da europa por meio da for a ter resultados desastrosos inclusive para a r ssia

7612618 repelir os russos ou capitular e aceitar um regime como no vichy
7612619 era um territ rio sem import ncia para a r ssia
7612620 inclusive quando come ou a subir a tens o ali achei que era um blefe e que seria poss vel parar tudo cometi essa falta porque pensei que o ataque principal ocorria na abkh zia n o que os russos pudessem atacar tbilisi
7612621 a r ssia tentou dar a impress o de que houve uma vit ria contra a otan organiza o do tratado do atl ntico norte a longo prazo n o pode ganhar esse jogo n o a uni o sovi tica

7612640 i think its extremely important just to keep making forward progress rather than trying prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
7612641 obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here

7612646 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7612647 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7612648 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7612649 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7612650 it is very standard there were no new rules for chinalco
7612651 there are two opposite conflicting views of why chinalco is there in the first place
7612652 i think that within 10 years this type of interactive targeting of potential partners could well be influencing migration flows even if only at the margins

7612659 we were told that it was a gang in dapto and four people were caught but police let them go
7612660 they are called wolf gang sic but as snr sgt kelly said when you get a hold of them they are the wuss gang
7612661 the police said they have got things in place to work out who these young guys are and they have been doing a lot of investigations out at the skate park on bong bong rd
7612662 it was in the carport attached to my house where my kids sleep
7612663 it has been alleged that there is a group of young people who identify themselves as a gang and they are engaging in antisocial behaviour but have i met them no have i seen them no
7612664 but other people have reported incidents and it is important that those incidents are reported to police and the police are given the opportunity to follow them up

7612673 the premier did indicate that if the ffa could guarantee that it would give a licence to a south coast team at win stadium that it would almost certainly mean that the government would fund a new western grandstand
7612674 and mr iemma has committed to meeting with us again as soon as the economic appraisal is completed
7612675 if the a league were to make a commitment that would certainly put enormous pressure on the premier and the local members to deliver
7612676 people shouldnt be afraid of their governments governments should fear their people

7612684 su indicazione della polizia giudiziaria stato sostituito con un altro indirizzo ip recante una pagina bianca di errore generico invece della precedente pagina di cortesia
7612685 una buffonata colossale che non tiene conto del fatto che ci si trova di fronte ad un procedimento penale seguito dalle forze dellordine e dalla magistratura con provvedimenti emessi da magistratura e dalla polizia giudiziaria che non consentono alcuna iniziativa autonoma da parte di privati e che questi ultimi anche se coinvolti sul piano tecnico sono comunque soggetti al controllo delle autorit che stanno seguendo lindagine contro i titolari del sito svedese
7612686 moskva has today departed toward the black sea fleets naval training range to check its radio controlled weapons and onboard communications systems

7612688 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7612689 given that our results are backed by numerous experimental studies showing that incense is a powerful producer of particulate matter and that incense smoke contains carcinogenic substances i believe incense should be used with caution

7612702 i absolutely loved my time here at unm and i especially love being able to work with the students as i campaign
7612703 the numbers that have to do with tuitions are dramatic
7612704 the growth of the average tuition is around 12 percent and that really hurts students who are looking for consistency in what they are paying
7612705 with more money available to students through loans or scholarships the value of the dollar would increase to meet the needs of students and their tuition prices
7612706 i made a decision on my own without talking to edwards or anybody to try to help them move to a community to try to get away from those folks
7612707 john edwards affair on his cancer stricken wife and fred barons apparent attempt to silence edwards mistress by spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on her reeks of the arrogance of two multimillionaire plaintiffs attorneys trying to buy the white house
7612708 lets hold a press conference and clear this thing up once and for all
7612709 i credit fred and freds energy with helping get the state democratic party back on the road to revival
7612710 its something he did not have to do and most certainly in my view he did it based on his own belief system that they needed to be a viable state party
7612711 every gross brained idiot is suffered to come into print
7612712 women do not find it difficult nowadays to behave like men but they often find it extremely difficult to behave like gentlemen

7612715 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7612716 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7612717 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7612718 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7612719 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7612720 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7612721 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7612722 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7612723 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7612724 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7612725 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7612726 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7612727 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7612728 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7612729 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7612730 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7612731 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7612732 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7612733 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7612734 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7612735 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7612736 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7612737 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7612738 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7612739 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7612740 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7612741 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7612742 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7612743 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7612744 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7612745 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7612746 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7612747 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7612748 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7612749 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7612750 we have a feeling that they have split up and went different ways from finding some of the jumpsuits throughout the city
7612751 the more america learns about this family the more theyre going to want to send them to the white house
7612752 he is lucid he is sharp he seems completely unchanged by the surgery
7612753 at the end of the week the convention will be unified
7612754 the country wants a democratic president they are just not sure about this democrat
7612755 a lot of people still dont know much about him
7612756 its not all silly hats its also about meaningful policy
7612757 sen obama is the best opportunity to change whats happening in d c

7612760 for me the course of action depends on the specialty how much i need them and how often i have to deal with them
7612761 the only reason i chose to stay was that it was relatively unimportant if you dont have a good rapport with the doctor whos supposed to be very involved with the hard work to save your life move on asap if they dont act concerned if they dont find you interesting its a key indicator that theyre not going to try and you need as many people trying as you can
7612762 sometimes i think feeling disliked is a mis match between treatment styles
7612763 i think it is utterly important for your caregivers to like you and for you to like them they are treating those of us with severe life threatening illnesses in some of our most vulnerable moments and that trust needs to be there they need to like you and if they dont then if its possible a new doctor needs to be found and imho we need to find the courage to ask that question do you like me
7612764 i think it is important to have a good rapport with a doctor there have been times i joked about how the reason i like my surgical oncologist is that he has a good sense of humor and that if you have to have an oncologist it helps for them to have a sense of humor
7612765 i have other doctors that ive had my ups and downs with
7612766 i have had doctors who i thought couldnt stand me and later realized it wasnt about me and we established a rapport
7612767 the devils advocate issue is everyone has a bad day
7612768 i guess my point is that i try to figure out if im being sensitive about something that isnt really about me but is about them sometimes when ive had a bad day people think im annoyed with them and i dont even realize that my manner is putting off that vibe i think its possible for a doctor to come into a patients room from a stressful situation and not even realize they are putting off a certain vibe there is no excuse for an unprofessional doctor but as long as they are professional then i try to give it a little time
7612769 speaking to reporters as she flew to tel aviv rice suggested there was little chance of getting some kind of agreement on paper in time for the u
7612770 its extremely important just to keep making forward progress rather than trying prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
7612771 we continue to have the same goal which is to reach agreement by the end of the year there is a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here

7612793 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7612794 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

7612796 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7612797 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7612798 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

7612805 strong parents have strong children and strong children have strong opinions and that usually leads to conflicts that they have difficulty reconciling
7612806 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7612807 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7612808 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7612809 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7612810 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

7612827 he has the opportunity to be a great defensive lineman
7612828 his get off is unmatched his physical attributes are scary hes really a physically strong guy hes good at catching on to snap counts and reading blocks he has an opportunity to be one of the best defensive players in the country
7612829 our second team defensive line could go anywhere in the country and start asap
7612830 i still cant believe i have a whole season in front of me
7612831 last year i was here just practicing and it was like i didnt have a reason but i did have a reason to help my team get better until it was time for me to go out there
7612832 now i focus in my head every day im making up for lost time i tell my coach dont ever take me out of practice let me take as many reps as i can till i cant walk no more
7612833 he has all of the characteristics you look for in an interior defensive lineman
7612834 hes physical enough to dominate at an inside position and athletic enough to move out to an end
7612835 it was a tremendous setback when we didnt have him last year but people got a taste of what hes capable of doing when he came back and played in sec championship game and the bcs national championship ricky may be as talented a defensive lineman as weve had in the three years weve been here
7612836 glenn was a great player one of the best ive ever seen but im not going to try and be him i have to be myself and play the way i know how to play
7612837 its like the offensive linemen are giving him a heads up or something
7612838 sometimes i just got up too high off the ball if the offensive lineman gets under you thats bad ive been working hard on staying low coming off the ball quick and low and trying to get around the corner before the lineman can get set
7612839 enough is enough can we please go to athens we havent been there since like 1998 thats way too long

7612852 for those families the prestige of the sothebys international realty brand is a powerful incentive
7612853 anything you can do i can do better i can do anything better than you
7612854 we are encouraged by a strong start to the year in what is traditionally our slowest quarter
7612855 our ongoing efforts to improve efficiency are also making a positive financial impact looking forward we expect that our continued success in expanding our existing customer relationships and a healthy sales pipeline will lead to further revenue growth in 2008
7612856 its been a very hectic time in the last month or two with other industry events
7612857 the fact that we got 600 people in a room is very satisfying
7612858 its not just about people supporting us by buying tickets its about people supporting us year round we need the ability to both raise awareness and thank the industry for their support

7612870 based on uncertainty around the launch date of new portables late in the quarter
7612871 given concerns regarding ipod weakness we believe the segments outperformance relative to typical seasonality is significant
7612872 jika hal hal ini terjadi pada anda justru anda akan mencoba lebih keras lagi
7612873 dia bahkan makin tak mau menyerah karena ini adalah cinta dia dia ingin menunjukkan pada orang orang bahwa dia sangat komit
7612874 seperti semua orang saya pun telah menanyakan pada dia apakah klub ini dijual dan dia bersikukuh bahwa klub ini tidak dijual dia di sini untuk jangka panjang
7612875 saya bertanya kenapa anda membeli klub ini dia katakan dia membelinya karena ada rencana 10 tahun
7612876 we would buy preferred stock subject to significant treasury participation and an attractive yield
7612877 it is a long term call on the common stock
7612878 without such a plan like this shareholders might get zero you want zero or ongoing companies
7612879 common holders will face dilution but it would be down the road with this plan
7612880 the equity is virtually worthless and will continue to be
7612881 if the treasury buys preferred stock though i would assume that would validate that class of equity during any liquidation reprivitization
7612882 the election season and the relatively recent passage of the treasury authorization argue for delay as long as possible
7612883 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
7612884 i dont think you will see much difference between northern iowa and some of the better teams in our league
7612885 i think coaches are tired of coaching against each other players are tired of running into each other im certain our team would like a chance to get back into the stadium and have their first attempt to reach our goals for the upcoming year
7612886 if we lose a player there to injury it is going to be a weakness on our team
7612887 why im skipping out on making my five year plan
7612888 russia needs to respect the territorial independence and sovereignty of georgia
7612889 the status of those two regions in georgia are not a matter for any one country to decide theyre a matter for the international community through the mechanisms at the united nations
7612890 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7612891 its fair to say that they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
7612892 we are looking at a number of things we might do
7612893 it should be borne in mind that the mou is a political document not a legally binding one and zanu pf could feel at liberty to put it aside
7612894 as it is it is likely that mugabe will go ahead and announce a full cabinet considering that he has already taken the first step by announcing provincial resident ministers governors and that could make the signing of a deal impossible
7612895 the voting trends for the speakers post indicate a purely party political agenda and not a national agenda
7612896 the fact that mugabe appointed governors only from his party is another indication that the talks are in trouble
7612897 will not give any ground he mugabe has forced the mdc mps members of parliament to be sworn in and that will see the impasse continue
7612898 hopes of an economic turnaround were pinned on a successful political deal given the direction in which things are moving the economic crisis will worsen
7612899 i foresee a situation in which industry will grind to a complete halt in the next six months thousands of people will join millions of other zimbabweans who are living outside the country as economic refugees and there will be more political tension
7612900 realmente son muy pocas las quejas que recibimos porque la gente no tiene la cultura de informarnos pero nosotros estamos abiertos para atender todos los asuntos que nos reporten
7612901 the coastline as it is now will be completely changed by the end of this century because the sea level is rising along the coast at around two centimetres every year
7612902 increasing salinity will make the ground water undrinkable and unsuitable for agricultural purposes the result will be food and water insecurity
7612903 it is all due to climate change the greenhouse gas emissions result in global warming and subsequent melting of the greenland ice cap
7612904 i think the best way out for the moment is devising simpler and more cost effective solutions such as how to preserve towns and villages under threat and preventing sea water intrusion
7612905 the sensible option is moving to higher ground which is a tough option especially for nigeria as it means giving up its economic centres in lagos and its oil installations in the delta
7612906 every solution to a problem must focus on the major cause of that problem and in this case greenhouse gas emissions by industrialised countries which are responsible for sea level rise must be effectively tackled
7612907 the industrialised countries should take proactive steps in curtailing their emissions responsible for climate change which will have a positive impact on sea level rise
7612908 as americans drive less because of the price of gas fewer claims will be filed with insurance companies
7612909 whether this will mean windfall profits for insurers or rate cuts for the consumers is up to governors and state regulators to determine

7612940 kde 4 1 le bureau le plus avanc du monde
7612941 escrib el libro para que haya debate pero un debate serio no infantil
7612942 las farc utilizan su exterminio para justificar la guerra mientras que los paramilitares la se alan como un ejemplo del enga o de la guerrilla y quienes est n en el medio la ven como una raz n m s por la cual la paz es todav a una realidad lejana
7612943 en el libro no se salva nadie no voy a decir que echo rosas al partido comunista que no lo hago ni a muchos miembros de la up pero tampoco es una cosa monol tica no es perfecto porque nada es blanco y negro
7612944 no puedo negar que soy extranjero y que tengo una ptica distinta pero me duele un poco la critica porque creo que hablan sin leer el libro
7612945 yo no digo que las farc mataron a la up eso es lo que dicen los de la derecha
7612946 no s lo desde el c rculo en el cual estaba conformado por activistas de derechos humanos miembros de la up y del partido comunista sindicalistas de la uni n sindical obrera y campesinos sino desde las personas que mataron a la gente de la up o que crearon la base ideol gica para poder eliminar un partido pol tico
7612947 de alguna manera encontr que obedeci a una serie de factores que se enredan en alg n momento determinado y crean el ambiente para poder acabar con un partido pol tico esas cosas van desde la misma combinaci n de todas las formas de lucha por parte del estado como por las farc ahora yo no encuentro razones para decir que la guerrilla mat a miembros de la up eso es una mentira me duele que hagan esas preguntas porque el libro no lo dice lo que pasa es que la gente lee un columnista que s lo dice y luego saca como conclusi n que esas son mis conclusiones
7612948 mi conclusi n es que el estado tiene la responsabilidad por lo que pas con la up pero las mismas farc hicieron tambi n un trabajo por reducir el espacio pol tico que ten an esos se ores y por no sacarlos a tiempo por no decir
7612949 de alguna manera s pero hay que decir que tambi n les sirvi porque las farc creci mucho durante y despu s de la up y eso les dio la justificaci n perfecta para seguir su lucha para siempre aunque ese no era el plan
7612950 no estoy justificando lo que ha hecho el estado incluso en varios apartes del libro hablo sobre los nexos del estado la polic a el ej rcito y el das con aquellos que mataron a la mayor a de las personas de la up entonces no s c mo es que estoy absolviendo al estado con un estudio muy cuidadoso muestro claramente que s hab a un nexo muy fuerte entre sectores del estado y los que matan a la gente de la up
7612951 hubo un gran compromiso por parte del estado la gran muestra para m es que no ataca a los paramilitares en los a os 1986 1987 incluso en 1988 no empieza a atacarlos sino hasta despu s de la muerte del candidato presidencia luis carlos gal n y la matanza de la rochela donde murieron 18 investigadores judiciales
7612952 directamente no tanto pero podr a decir que esa base ideol gica que acaba con la up comienza en los a os 50 cuando hay un auge importante de militares colombianos que reciben entrenamiento en estados unidos sobre la doctrina de seguridad nacional ah s juega un papel fundamental y crea una mentalidad para m perversa que implica que cualquier persona puede ser enemigo desde el cura hasta el ama de casa
7612953 el espacio pol tico de la izquierda es mucho mayor hoy que antes incluso he visto un auge muy importante del polo democr tico alternativo en 1986 y 1990 s lo alcanzaba el 4 en las votaciones en el a o 2006 lleg al 22 con carlos gaviria hoy s que ese porcentaje se puede conseguir sin que los maten es un logro y hay que reconocerlo si se protegen los espacios pol ticos si las instituciones se ocupan de hacerlo y si la gente se siente segura al expresarse en todo tipo de debates entonces habr una discusi n de fondo sobre el conflicto y ojal eso lleve a una negociaci n

7613066 amy doesnt want to give up drugs so shes got to learn the hard way in prison
7613067 police have to act she is making a mockery of the law it has got to stop
7613068 the price amy has got to pay is losing her freedom
7613069 my position is that a sensible jury would not expect people to be sniffing talcum powder
7613070 prison has helped blake give up drugs and hes doing brilliantly in edmunds hill
7613071 when he went in pentonville last november he was in a terrible mess his skin was a horrible dirty yellow color he was painfully thin and he had dead eyes i will never forget that haunted look i feared we were going to lose him
7613072 but they gave him amazing medical treatment in prison to get him off drugs and then helped him conquer his personal demons
7613073 now nine months on he looks amazing he has put on nearly two stone in weight his skin is glowing with health and he is so relaxed and happy
7613074 but while blake has been inside amy has gone disastrously downhill
7613075 prison worked for blake its the only thing that can now save amy
7613076 blakes been given his own room with an ensuite shower
7613077 he also has a tv cd player and a shelf full of books in his room
7613078 he even has his own key so he can lock himself in if he wants privacy
7613079 its so much nicer than pentonville which was the pits
7613080 and the difference in blake since hes been in there is absolutely amazing
7613081 they are respectful and dont even mention her name to him
7613082 instead of doing work in prison blake has chosen to do an educational course to keep him busy and is doing art and writing
7613083 the video will come as a bitter blow to him
7613084 i hope this time it works but i have heard it so many times before i havent any faith in her
7613085 amy tried to get in to see blake last weekend but was turned away because she was too late
7613086 we didnt have a driver when we visited blake but she had a driver and she still couldnt turn up on time
7613087 blake was not impressed he is only allowed three visits a month
7613088 since blake has been in prison amy has just deteriorated more and more while he has managed to get himself clean inside
7613089 blake told me i promise you mum when i get out of prison i will sort amy out
7613090 but she has deteriorated to such an extent that i know even blake cant save her now
7613091 she needs to stay in there for the next four months until blake comes out of prison or be locked up in jail until she gets herself clean
7613092 blake hopes she will beat drugs for him and save their marriage
7613093 but its clear amy loves drugs more than her husband
7613094 all she seems to care about is her next fix

7613098 when firefox users click on a web site that uses a self signed certificate they get a security error message that leaves many people bewildered
7613099 he thinks hes famous as jen now last week he went to a party tipped off the paps and even had decoy cars at the ready when he was leaving
7613100 nice but no one bothered to follow them which made john think he lost everyone when really no one bothered to follow him
7613101 pictures of him and jen were selling for 20 000 at one point a picture of him alone gets 200 now chasing him from his apartment to nobu is hardly worth it
7613102 i came here as cornerback first special teams second thats the mindset ive always had ive been a cornerback and ive been playing different positions as well ive had confidence at the cornerback position my whole life they didnt
7613103 i think in the last week he solidified his position as a starter
7613104 we will help him get where he has a better opportunity to compete

7613136 the dominant paradigm within which social scientists assess natural resource issues
7613137 has been embraced as a sacred text by scholars and professionals in the practice of designing futures for others and imposing their own economic and environmental rationality on other social systems of which they have incomplete understanding and knowledge
7613138 the rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd
7613139 it is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons as a rational being each herdsman seeks to maximize his gain

7613144 nice piece 5 yrs old belongs to my gf and she wants to sell it
7613145 my client was contacted by the fbi at her job and was told a little bit about what her husbands activities were
7613146 she was completely blindsided she had no idea of the double life this man was leading
7613147 i think both of those guys can hold the point in the middle
7613148 obviously they both have to learn how to sustain and improve as pass rushers but both of those guys have done a really good job and those two guys can certainly complement each other especially if we can play two of them and get effective performance out of both of them that might be helpful to us and it would be helpful to the overall depth of the rest of the guys on the defensive line as well
7613149 ive been a head coach here 10 years and havent won a conference championship disappointed yes was mark richt disappointed last year when they didnt win the conference championship how disappointed was he
7613150 im always disappointed when we dont and the stats are only one way its either black or white theres no gray area when you throw things like that on the table
7613151 terry had to at auburn i had to tommy had to terry lost tommys come out of it and he won
7613152 i think the program has come a long way from when i first got here
7613153 when i first got here they didnt go to a bowl game because of the incident ever since then weve been progressing every year
7613154 now he ought to come out and tell me the same thing
7613155 hes beaten me three in a row he should say hey daddy you better start recruiting of course that is the name of the game of course those days i had better players than him and now hes gotten better players
7613156 he worked at it started recruiting hard hiring a staff that could recruit good and get those good football players thats what weve got to do
7613157 i think in every program until you get over that cusp youll have some people who are going to be negative
7613158 looking at going forward ive got confidence hes going to get us over that hump
7613159 hes not happy not getting over that hump hes not satisfied hes awfully close and tommys very competitive hes a very hard worker of all the coaches ive been around tommy is the hardest working individual he has tremendous work ethic and will turn every stone he can to be successful and hes going to work hard at doing it
7613160 the reason we gave him that contract was to get over the hump quite frankly
7613161 there are no ifs ands or buts about that we believe going forward our best opportunity for our program is to maintain continuity with him and our staff to give him an opportunity to continue to recruit and build the program
7613162 again i look at the timeframe a little bit differently than everybody else apparently i think a lot of good things have happened in the last five years and i look for good things to continue i believe for the best for our program that if we can maintain continuity with coach bowden and our coaching staff that gives us the quickest and opportunity to get what we want and thats to win a fair share of conference championships and compete at the national level like we want to
7613163 i want to say my father was at florida state 13 years before he won a national championship although i know we havent won a conference championship
7613164 they were talking about how mack brown for so long couldnt win the big one tom osborne couldnt win the big one and i dont think bo schembechler ever did until you win a championship and more youre going to have to answer that type of question
7613165 i think definitely if coach bowden can win the acc championship thatd definitely get him over the hump
7613166 everybody says going to the championship game is good enough weve got to win it youve got to win it
7613167 it says youve accomplished something and theres some stability in your program
7613168 theres a pretty good chance john parker wilson will be our quarterback
7613169 to lead the team is the biggest thing just help these young guys and teach them everything i can its my third year and ive seen a bunch of stuff
7613170 when i get hurt you see what you missed and try to come back and its kind of like you want to be there so bad that it motivates yourself to get going
7613171 i think it kind of started before the season because i was kind of feeling it but i could push through it and it was like no more
7613172 okay we admit it we dont really have a good qb to start but well be ok because were going to play them all seriously well probably win the sec

7613240 i cant say whether their intention was to intimidate but if they can do this to an influential writer who has done nothing more than take photographs then one can only imagine the kind of threat that ordinary people in tibet must feel every day

7613277 the banking industry goes into this mess much stronger than it was
7613278 as the fdic incurs losses those losses will be passed back to the banking industry
7613279 we had one of the largest and certainly what we think will be one of the most expensive failures at the beginning of the cycle
7613280 although its going to be challenging its not going to be all that bad
7613281 if anyone has a deposit of less than 100 000 they can sleep as soundly as always
7613282 i was shocked that the fdic did not have indymac on its watch list until a month before
7613283 you may have an inexperienced team remember for the last 13 or 14 years the banking industry has been pretty benign

7613317 your gun control position doesnt have anything to do with public safety and its certainly not about personal freedom
7613318 its a little like the conservative party line on the disintegration of the black family we look at the statistics and assume our case is strong while ignoring the fact that telling the black community theyd be fine if they all stopped being so dissolute
7613319 as much as legislators and founders of states ought to be honored and respected among men as much ought the founders of sects and factions to be detested and hated

7613322 who born for the universe narrowed his mind and to party gave up what was meant for mankind
7613323 we need people in the united states congress who are going to hold democrats feet to the fire so that we do right by the american people and who arent going to just follow the party line but make sure that the party line is the right line to follow

7613328 i was at a point in my own career where it was time to look back and assess the influences who have been pivotal in my life
7613329 creating a festival of words was one way to honor and celebrate the people who have influenced me the people who continue to inspire and challenge with their poetry i also wanted young writers or writers new to albuquerque to have the same opportunities ive had
7613330 were pushing the limits of poetry and initiating a lot of interdisciplinary dialogue

7613339 canadian universities offer high quality education with globally recognized degrees it has not been as well advertised as higher education in the us or uk yet in my university the ryerson university in toronto indians make up the highest number of the 900 foreign students
7613340 in delhi we are visiting nine schools which includes the delhi public school r k puram the british school and the vasant valley school the tour concludes aug 28 and we hope that by the end of it we would have convinced most of the students that canada is the ideal destination for higher studies
7613341 the programmes most in demand correspond to the popularity of the subject here therefore although courses like engineering and business management maybe more expensive than other courses they are still more popular
7613342 in the normal course the auditor is always required to assess valuation as an assertion while auditing the financial statements it is difficult to imagine a balance sheet without valuation from a chartered accountant only a chartered accountant has the overall perspective of valuation in its totality the education and training imparted to a ca in the varied areas of valuation from traditional business valuation to the emerging brand and ipr valuation is recognized by the business world
7613343 apart from knowledge of relevant laws and management perspective valuation requires core competence in the area of accounting finance in general and valuation technique methodology in particular that is why across the globe valuation primarily falls under the ambit of the accountancy profession the chartered accountancy curriculum does provide knowledge in the above areas the course on valuation to be launched by icai is a step forward in the direction to enhance the competitive edge of its members in the global service market
7613344 in india there is no such course which can be compared with this 100 hours comprehensive curriculum though some management institutes are providing short term courses for mbas but the course curriculum of such courses is not so focused as to deal with the valuation job in the changing global scenario

7613375 there are a few people who have come here to peek to be critical to dig into the small details and find fault

7613377 everybody wants to talk abut nba players being selfish being arrogant being individuals what you saw today was a team binding together facing adversity and coming out of here with a big win
7613378 it became a little bit too much it all started to sink in i had to take a step out and collect my thoughts
7613379 obviously this is the best of times and worst of times
7613380 and im going to delve into both emotions and embrace them
7613381 our belief is that you have to talk in all four directions to be listened to
7613382 we want everyone to have a good time in this beautiful building and not get out of hand you know how human beings are but were all gods children

7613391 the fact that we had tried to get a jump on it and he wasnt interested in what we had to say it would appear were not getting him
7613392 i believe it is an issue but i need to do some more background before i really comment on anything

7613397 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
7613398 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7613399 since the case is sub judice we cant comment as of now
7613400 however we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release
7613401 it is getting easier to avoid watching traditional tv advertising
7613402 man ferrostaal has warned the sunday times that their false allegations of bribery are damaging to current negotiations for the construction of oil and gas platforms in the companys offset projects in saldanha bay western cape province and cape town this might endanger the creation of thousands of jobs
7613403 international companies react very sensitively to bribery allegations and i am concerned that your false allegations might have a negative impact on these negotiations
7613404 your false allegations in the sunday times articles from august 3 and august 10 not only put the creation of jobs at risk but also jeopardizes the return of a promising industry to sa
7613405 no donations to any political party were in any way part of the contracting process

7613412 we are really concerned about the small tortoiseshell which has been in long term decline and which seems to have reached a trough and stayed there
7613413 the biden choice seems to have done precisely what barack obama needed it to do it has thrust him back into the lead overall and has consolidated his support among democrats and put him back into the lead among independent voters while hillary clinton tops the list of preferred choices for vice president it is all to clear from this latest polling that her negatives far outweigh her positives her presence on the ticket would have dominated the fall campaign and distracted from obamas issues agenda
7613414 interestingly besides the obvious support for mitt romney as mccains vice presidential partner which keeps the race competitive voters seem to be otherwise in favor of condoleezza rice to the number two slot on the gop ticket
7613415 i want to grow up and be a larva too
7613416 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7613417 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7613418 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7613419 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7613420 no one works for someone we all just work together
7613421 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7613422 todays military families are facing a perfect storm multiple deployments rising gas and food prices the sub prime mortgage mess and a struggling economy coupled with visible and invisible wounds of war many families cant win this battle without our assistance

7613432 no i am a muslim but most of us dont pay any attention to that alcohol stuff have your beer
7613433 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7613434 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7613435 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7613436 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7613437 officially victorias people say no runway show was planned and this has nothing to do with katie launching her line but the truth is victoria doesnt want the inevitable comparisons
7613438 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7613439 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7613440 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7613441 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7613442 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7613443 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

7613468 i dont think marc would be in the press the way he is if he didnt want to be

7613471 womens ordination as priests and now bishops has dominated debate and headlines but while looking at women in the pulpit we have taken our eyes off the pews where a shift with more consequences for the churchs survival is underway

7613479 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7613480 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7613481 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7613482 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7613483 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7613484 while this billboard itself wasnt sexualising children it was placing sex before them
7613485 given what was happening in the community and the senate inquiry into the sexualisation of children in the media we considered that there had been a definite shift in community standards
7613486 there will always be certain hot points within the community that are of concern
7613487 the boards role is to walk the line between advertisers being able to advertise their product and the community not being offended

7613502 schlopy committed himself this summer to being in the best possible shape for this season and hes already seeing the payoff of that commitment
7613503 these races were more of a dress rehearsal for our team coaches and athletes and id say it went pretty well
7613504 if we were to listen to the democrats in washington d c who say lets have a fixed date of withdrawal by the way thats code word for saying leave before the job is done we would turn over this important country to radicals and extremists who would plot and plan and attack

7613518 again this proves that steve pearces message is resonating with new mexicans
7613519 pearce is on the side of increasing domestic energy finding alternative energy sources lower taxes and less regulation tom udall is on the side of the anti drilling anti nuclear extremists who use endless litigation and excessive regulation to prevent american progress
7613520 with these results its should be no surprise that udall is running from his record on the issues new mexicans support increasing access to energy and limited government udall has been voting against those positions for more than a decade while steve pearce has been consistent in fighting for new mexicos interests

7613767 no matter what campaign ad we see or how its spun hope is important its what this country was based on
7613768 that tag that sen obamas been given is a campaign ploy obviously by the republican party
7613769 i dont see him hanging out i have yet to see him at any celebrity events
7613770 this is the first time that a political convention of any sort has been surrounded with the awareness of environmental issues
7613771 yeah and regardless of what political affiliation you want to align yourself with this is an issue its real no matter which side you decide to attack it from

7613778 lo que hace que barcelona sea una gran ciudad es tener barrios como el de sants con personas que dedican su tiempo a llevar a cabo de forma desinteresada proyectos como los de engalanar las calles
7613779 cant test it cant prove it cant disprove it its not a question for science
7613780 i cannot physically make the march because i had surgery so im kinda hobbled three miles is more than im going to be able to do
7613781 some of the advantages of perennial crops are that once theyre established then a lot of the crop inputs are reduced you dont have to spend as much money on things like herbicides
7613782 it does not take a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men
7613783 if ever a time should come when vain and aspiring men shall possess the highest seats in government our country will stand in need of its experienced patriots to prevent its ruin
7613784 it does not take a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men
7613785 if ever a time should come when vain and aspiring men shall possess the highest seats in government our country will stand in need of its experienced patriots to prevent its ruin
7613786 people should be able to get on the ballot in states im sure that if governor bush told them dont do that dont remove mccains name they would respond everybody knows that i am a legitimate candidate i should be on the ballot

7613794 im not here to be a role model personality im here to be in the business of f cking rock and roll being in the business of rock and roll means having an attitude being sexy being edgy and being unapologetic unless i do something wrong i look up to people like joan jett pat benatar freddie mercury and cyndi lauper i want to have that same type of appeal if people want a role model they can have miley cyrus
7613795 so last night some friends and i went to see a jodeci reunion tour at the enmore theater in sydney
7613796 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits

7613798 el reforzamiento de la vigilancia en el aila con nfasis en los vuelos que vienen de sudam rica ha hecho posible que en un espacio de menos de 24 horas hayan sido ocupados 90 paquetes con un peso aproximados de 95 kilos cargas tra das al pa s procedentes de colombia
7613799 inertia is the resistance an object has to a change in its state of motion
7613800 3 versus 0 02 isnt too much difference i guess
7613801 why do pundits still suggest saving up for an emergency fund nobody does it stop beating a dead horse and come up with another suggestion
7613802 weve got jerk chicken patties curried goat and rice and peas

7613805 this is the best street carnival in europe people come to london just for this
7613806 its all about unity no race no creed no colour no gender
7613807 symphony of life is the burrokeets theme this year we are originally a trinidad franchise band but we welcome everyone
7613808 we cater mostly for the young but as you can see we have grandparents taking part
7613809 we want to show the people we are enjoying ourselves and bring joy to people here
7613810 its lost some of its size however i think its actually more multi cultural than years gone by
7613811 its created a lot more diversity which is better for everyone
7613812 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted
7613813 young women tend to express egalitarian values and dislike the
7613814 womens ordination as priests and now bishops has dominated debate and headlines but while looking at women in the pulpit we have taken our eyes off the pews where a shift with more consequences for the churchs survival is underway
7613815 gone are the days when the mother was at home during the
7613816 with the pressures women face churches must adapt to make themselves more accessible
7613817 im absolutely convinced that when we have women as bishops that it
7613818 i always experience myself as falling apart and im taking emergency measures its coming apart at every moment i try prozac i try love i try drugs i try zen meditation i try the monastery i try forgetting about all those strategies and going straight and the place where the evaluation happens is where i write the songs when i get to that place where i cant be dishonest about what ive been doing
7613819 io lo so che a volte piangere un problema come so che quando ridi sei suprema ma in fondo hai solo 21 anni e tu gi lo sai che non ti scorderai mai di questa storia e ti domandi gli altri come fanno mai come fanno come fanno mai e intanto passa il tempo e tu tralasci ogni momento assaggi la tua vita ma non sai che sapore ha perch tu non vuoi pi crescere io lo so che quando parli tu non pesi parole come so che quando pensi vorresti essere altrove ma poche volte sai ti rendi conto mentre vivi un momento che poi sar speciale e intanto passa il tempo e tu tralasci largomento assaggi la tua vita ma non sai che sapore ha perch tu non vuoi crescere crescere crescere la la la ma in fondo hai solo 21 anni e tu gi lo sai non ti scorderai mai di questa storia e ti domanderai gli altri come fanno mai come fanno come fanno mai
7613820 the industry and visitors are giving us their clear support to continue with the fair in leipzig
7613821 do you think there should be a gc in leipzig in 2009
7613822 anyone who has experienced the enthusiastic mood in the exhibition halls over the last seven years knows this fair belongs in leipzig
7613823 the fairs and conferences in leipzig are becoming increasingly international and attract more and more visitors were pleased with this development i completely agree with the governor of the free state of saxony stanislaw tillich that we will do everything to help this new cultural sector and the gc games convention to achieve further success
7613824 the concept is flexible and the network of the global games industry permits us to be active at different locations after the southeast asian games convention we are now focusing on the north american market

7613831 it has become increasingly difficult to build new asylum centres
7613832 there are several reasons for this such as fear of foreigners a lack of knowledge about what an asylum centre is and various issues concerning the local municipalities
7613833 who wants to live here if the area is teeming with mentally unstable individuals forced upon the ordinary residents and the hospital patients suffering from mental health issues living here
7613834 this is way out of proportion any problems associated with these proposed asylum centres do not merit such a massive protest people in these municipalities really need to tone down their behaviour
7613835 its time for the nation to come together and work as a team the local councils need to calm down this country has room for thousands of people
7613836 we dont need any loud and unruly newcomers in our neighborhood
7613837 i wrote the book in the hopes that children will get better lives
7613838 i want to see more integration and the responsibility for that lies with the somalians themselves and with the authorities
7613839 im tired of being patient with a situation where children arent getting enough food at home where women are beaten by their husbands where welfare payments to the somalian families are used by the men to buy the narcotic khat where the willingness to simply obtain more welfare money is stronger than the ability to care for children
7613840 half of the somalians in norway have been here less than five years have little education and have problems integrating
7613841 somalia is now facing the worst security situation in the last 17 years with increased armed conflict and fighting targeting of humanitarian aid workers military build up increased sea piracy and political tension
7613842 this situation is severely undermining economic activities and humanitarian delivery thus contributing to the overall deterioration in the humanitarian situation
7613843 the p1 is a little better at receiving signal and the n73 a little better at sending signals but the difference is small the difference between the iphones and the p1s receive sensitivity is 2 db

7613851 hey guys i am a straight guy here if you actually have a hotel room and are planning to use the dnc gang bang slut that has already posted i would appreciate if you let me know where you plan on using her whats one more gonna hurt thanks
7613852 the critic is the only independent source of information the rest is advertising
7613853 i hope i strike a blow for chubby bald men everywhere i hope they rise like an army
7613854 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7613855 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7613856 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7613857 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7613858 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7613859 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7613860 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7613861 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7613862 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7613863 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7613864 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7613865 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7613866 you cant just walk in with somebodys medicaid card like its a credit card and have heart surgery done
7613867 a doctor would need to know blood type cardiac history medical history and other comprehensive records that just couldnt be faked this doesnt make sense
7613868 relationships are a numbers game and you need to position yourself in a location where you have a greater probability of bumping into a candidate in your age group and single
7613869 as a consequence we need to reset our expectations about believing its only a matter of time before my number comes up and i bump into miss right or mr right
7613870 what young women do not understand is that the interest of many of their suitors may not be because of their hotness it might be that these boys are both lonely and desperate
7613871 to correct this situation women need to deflate their perceived hotness by the proportion by which single men outnumber single women
7613872 rural australia is littered with towns where there is an oversupply of single men
7613873 women have changed their priorities thirty years ago they may have married straight out of school to the farmer next door but now they are saying they want education and training and job opportunities and they gravitate to the cities
7613874 it upsets the gender balance in rural areas and the cities so you have concepts like they reflect that because all these single women gravitate to the city for jobs thats the divide that has opened up and you get these quite remarkable figures like at glenden
7613875 i can foresee an online and interactive heat map linked perhaps to something like
7613876 in other words find me the top 10 towns in australia where there is the highest ratio to single women of single men aged 25 34 who are single catholic and who earn more than 80 000 a year not politically correct but its do able we have the technology indeed i think we will be dating by geography within five years
7613877 the galaxy cluster is so big that there can only be a handful of them at that distance
7613878 thanks to the support of the dfi team and the influence of dani johnson and her training
7613879 my home business provides my income but dani johnson taught me how to succeed
7613880 in a support group like dfi we dont hold back secrets like that

7613889 i spoke with germanys chancellor merkel this morning to make the european position uniform harder and categorical concerning russia in the context of the crisis in the caucasus
7613890 it seems that this polish viewpoint we have been presenting from the beginning is beginning to be current position in the european union
7613891 i spoke with president sarkozy a few days ago and he did not hide that russias behaviour is beginning to be irritating to a certain degree and will require the eu to make firm decisions
7613892 at least on some points we have the impression russia is flouting this agreement
7613893 we expected this kind of development this demonstrates that russia is hardening its position
7613894 this result confirms what mr zardari has argued since 1997
7613895 word life shortys gonna get her beaucoups culture stacks up
7613896 part of the reason that kuwait and others are able to come in and purchase our financial institutions is because we dont have an energy policy we are sending close to a billion dollars a day overseas a realistic plan is going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and invest in solar and wind and bio diesel that would make a substantial difference in our balance of payments and foreign capacity to purchase our assets
7613897 if i am president i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector to a single overarching goal in 10 years we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela
7613898 when john f kennedy decided that we were going to put a man on the moon he put the full resources of the us government behind the project and called on the ingenuity and innovation of the american people
7613899 i proposed a cap and trade system because you can be very specific in terms of how to reduce the greenhouse gases by a particular level every little bit of pollution sent up into the atmosphere that polluter is getting charged for it on a carbon tax the cost will be passed on to consumers we have an obligation to use some of the money that we generate to shield low income and fixed income individuals from higher electricity prices
7613900 we have to get serious about increasing our fuel efficiency standards and investing in new technologies
7613901 we hope the new tools in the hands of home buyers from the recently enacted housing stimulus package will spark a sustained sales uptrend in the months ahead
7613902 buyers whove been on the sidelines should take a closer look at whats available to them now in terms of financing and incentives given some of the inventory on the market we also strongly encourage buyers to get a professional home inspection
7613903 sales have picked up significantly in several florida and california markets home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time
7613904 still inventory remains high in many parts of the country and will require time to fully absorb we expect more balanced conditions in 2009 and will eventually return to normal long term appreciation patterns

7613936 obama has picked someone who is going to be very aggressive in going after mccain and who is not going to be recalcitrant about it
7613937 if i was mccain id be thinking about my own attack dog
7613938 hes going to want someone who can go toe to toe with biden
7613939 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate
7613940 obama has effectively checked mccain on mccains only relevant argument by choosing biden who has more foreign policy and washington experience than mccain

7613977 michelle obama steps out tonight to address the nation is she baracks best asset
7613978 michelle obama is known for her fashion forward style but when it comes to her style of eating she likes good old fashioned comfort food we asked close friend and family confidant valerie jarrett to give us the inside scoop beginning with michelles favorite food
7613979 tonight michelle obama will command a national audience americans will not only analyze what she has to say theyll also pay keen attention to what she wears
7613980 she wore black leggings and black and white sun dress from the gap flew off the shelves that same day so we are seeing that she is setting a trend not just in politics but really in everybodys everyday lives
7613981 how interesting is it though that so much focus is on that and heres this very serious person went to harvard big time lawyer community organizer all of this stuff in her biography and there really is what she does resonates throughout huge portions of the populace
7613982 especially if barack obama wins and she does indeed become the first lady i think shes honored to be known as some sort of budding political fashion icon but at the same time i think she wants people to focus tonight especially on what she has to say
7613983 whatever she wears tonight could be in your closets tomorrow
7613984 what did she mean when she said clip of michelle obama speaking for the first time in my adult lifetime im really proud of my country

7614062 in fact if economic conditions continue to worsen in europe they may even precede the fed with a rate cut
7614063 the factor that will tip the scales is gdp growth the fact that the euro zone economy contracted by 0 2 in the second quarter is a real eye opener trichet can no longer argue that the u s slowdown has not affected europe
7614064 the slowdown has hit europes shores and its likely to get worse before it gets better
7614065 may even prompt the ecb to cut rates before the fed does in the fall

7614103 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
7614104 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
7614105 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
7614106 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
7614107 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
7614108 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
7614109 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
7614110 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
7614111 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
7614112 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
7614113 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same

7614119 por respeto al rival a la gente que asistir al campo y a nuestra afici n nuestra obligaci n es salir a por la victoria personalmente me ilusiona en cada partido defender la camiseta del bar a
7614120 lo nico que queremos es que la historia del barcelona se siga escribiendo de una manera muy buena no hay que comparar sino pensar en lo que todos van a aportar para el bar a
7614121 estamos aqu porque a n no estamos clasificados para la liga de campeones de lo contrario no estar amos en polonia sino en barcelona entren ndonos
7614122 nos jugamos el a o en esta partido as que estar muy atento al comportamiento de mis jugadores en el encuentro de ma ana porque no es para tom rselo a la ligera
7614123 sigo pensando lo mismo que pensaba de ellos antes de la ida es un equipo que sabe a lo que juega tiene muy buenos jugadores sobre todo en la parcela defensiva y cosas muy interesantes los campeones de cualquier liga siempre me merecen mucho respeto
7614124 thanks to the support of the dfi team and the influence of dani johnson and her training
7614125 my home business provides my income but dani johnson taught me how to succeed
7614126 in a support group like dfi we dont hold back secrets like that

7614129 stockwell day says street gang prevention having positive impact in montreal
7614130 i could see already that their presence is already recognized theyre having an affect
7614131 causing street gangs to be less aggressive and more restrained in their activities
7614132 thats a municipal and provincial responsibility and theyre handling it at that level
7614133 in those terms certainly i think this was a success
7614134 open source physical security can we have both privacy and safety
7614135 it the incident was blown way out of proportion by a sheriff who wanted his fifteen minutes of fame
7614136 my family is wonderful so very happy were all great
7614137 im shocked by the video when i look at amy i think for christs sake just get a grip of yourself enough is enough as the police know amy is a drug addict and she has now been caught twice on film taking illegal drugs they should arrest her and put her behind bars rehab clinics are a waste of money unless you want them to work amy doesnt want to give up drugs so shes got to learn the hard way in prison police have to act she is making a mockery of the law it has got to stop
7614138 britney spears will not be performing at the vmas this year im telling you officially and unequivocally
7614139 is in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and was never supposed to perform at that show
7614140 why give a fuck when you can not give a fuck
7614141 no and thats the problem she wouldnt have made it without the show the show was crucial to her success those types of shows work for some artists
7614142 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7614143 we know that cascadia drivers are proud of their trucks and like to stand out from the crowd
7614144 our new chrome package options give drivers the ability to trick out their vehicles while still enjoying all of the cascadias extensive benefits
7614145 what weve created is a lighter and safer 4000 d x trailer model with this composite design
7614146 its an optimum balance of light tare weight durability cubic capacity and low maintenance cost in my personal view were in high fuel cost environment from now on so its critical that trailers are lighter yet still also withstand the abuse of the road
7614147 the foam is more costly but makes it less labor intensive to build the trailer
7614148 thats why the price of the 4000 d x composite model will be comparable to current 4000 d x pricing
7614149 the bonding force of the foam gives this trailer a long life expectancy without sacrificing the 101 in interior dimensions required by fleets
7614150 from our destructive testing analysis we figure weve got a two lifetime trailer here one that can last about 20 years and probably more
7614151 minor shirk is more hidden than a black ant on a black stone in the middle of a moonless night
7614152 these vessels are a key priority of the government of canada
7614153 however the government must ensure that canadian taxpayers receive the best value for their money
7614154 with those new ships our ability to protect canadians where they live and where they work at home in canada around the continent or across the world will be enhanced
7614155 they have all these grandiose announcements and then turn around and say they cant do it
7614156 why do they play around like that with the emotions of the men and women of the military
7614157 now we found out that the government has sent someone over to europe to see if those ships can be built there
7614158 they dont mind making these announcements in broad daylight during the middle of the week when they have national media attention
7614159 but when they decide to cancel theyre like a little mouse in a church like no one will notice but were noticing
7614160 urging the defence minister and the conservative government to honour their commitments and honour their promises to the navy and to the coast guard
7614161 when we get back to ottawa i plan to pursue this quite vigorously with my colleagues
7614162 uma can o suave de menestr is uma f bula a triste despedida e a eterna procura narradas em um poema escrito pelo grande amigo e poeta leonardo antunes

7614258 other agencies use badges and other simple identification forms to give the public a clue of which agency theyre with i think thats a much more judicious use of taxpayer money than fancy jackets
7614259 if you want an example why taxpayers do not trust government im hard pressed to think of a better example than this
7614260 we want to represent the type of professional we want to place

7614273 i want everyone to know that though i asked for 600 million in cuts speaker silver along with his staff brought up 850 million in cuts that could have taken us further than we were and the only thing that stood between us and those reductions was the new york state senate
7614274 at this time the governor would do well to heed the advice of one of the leading voices of his party over the last generation the late new york senator daniel patrick moynihan who famously observed everyone is entitled to his own opinion but not his own facts
7614275 the facts are these the assembly had no list of real spending reductions that would have allowed us to achieve additional savings and further strengthen the states finances if they do have such a list the governor should make it public immediately
7614276 given the increasing prevalence of autism it is vitally important that special education teachers and administrators be specially trained to address the needs of autistic children

7614284 put obama into the white house even though hes not qualified to be president and we can have a post racial era
7614285 as democrats arrived here sunday for a convention intended to promote party unity mistrust and resentments continued to boil among top associates of presumptive nominee barack obama and his defeated rival hillary rodham clinton
7614286 there is still work to do on the bill clinton front
7614287 he feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process
7614288 obama ran a campaign that in many ways repudiated the clinton presidency and often signals that he would make different choices than the ones bill clinton made
7614289 the net result of that is to raise questions about the clinton legacy and the clintons especially bill clinton is very sensitive to his legacy and how it is being shaped
7614290 specifically praise the accomplishments of the clinton presidency in a line or two during his speech on thursday
7614291 abqcleve if thats your definition of race baiting then obama played one with his
7614292 she proesses a remarkable drive and intelligence to serve this county if elected i will insure that the country continues to benefit from all she has to offer
7614293 w is the uniter nobody can take that away from him

7614295 my father joined our party because the democrats in jim crow alabama of 1952 would not register him to vote
7614296 in the 21st century geographic regions are growing ever more integrated economically politically and culturally
7614297 last chance to send money to clinton instead of obama to show obama the back of your hand even small amounts like the price of a lunch add up on the internet
7614298 do any of you honestly believe that any intelligent adult who has a comprehensive understanding of bill and hillarys positions and policies historically have actually choose to support john mccain mysogynist and shirt chaser rights activist over sen obama whos positions and policies are within microns of bill and hillarys life work
7614299 the obamas have gone out of their way to honor the clintons
7614300 its hillary clinton who needs to de fang these pumas
7614301 wants obama to help her raise money to pay off the debt she acquired trying to beat him this is a first in politics
7614302 unless they work their butts off for the annointed one
7614303 demands for military information were accompanied by threats to terminate my medical treatment if i d student mcsuper rich seven mansions wall street ooiiillll millionaire mccain did not cooperate eventually i gave them my ships name and squadron number and confirmed that my target had been the power plant
7614304 carter lost in a landlside when he asked for re approval bush won
7614305 one reason al gore barely lost in 2000 was thanks to clinton fatigue and the lackluster clinton himself gave to the gore campaign
7614306 if youre not part of the solution you are part of the problem
7614307 wrong ive never voted for a republican in any local or national election im such a consistent voter that one year i drove an hour and back to vote when i was studying for an exam
7614308 he feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process
7614309 well there is your opinion and then on the other hand there are facts
7614310 aspergirl is fairly typical of the independents i speak of
7614311 how can someone with a liberal arts degre get a job in this economy
7614312 the rock candy has melted and only diamonds now remain
7614313 ya mean the carly fiorina who couldnt cut it running hp
7614314 during her tenure the market halved hp s value and the company incurred heavy job losses
7614315 exactly and hillary clinton scorned women better be aware that if mcsame gets into office the two potential seats will be filled with right wingers who have no respect for women and what they believe is best for their bodies
7614316 during her tenure the market halved hp s value and the company incurred heavy job losses
7614317 thanks to obamas race baiting of the clintons im die hard in my opposition to obama its bad enough that he is the least qualified shallowest most self aggrandizing presidential nominee of the modern era
7614318 to be clear i believe both senator clinton and senator obama have done much to heal the rifts endemic to a long primary
7614319 similarly by encouraging senator clintons name to be placed in nomination senator obama has shown real respect for her and her supporters that roll call will be an important unifying event and is a credit to senator obamas foresight and understanding
7614320 there is still work to do on the bill clinton front he feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process
7614321 no she has to be careful to not act like theresa heinz kerry and talk about herself too much
7614322 aspergirl can you really see carly fiorina steppin gin as president of the united states lol
7614323 if i didnt actually have a set of priciples and a coherent political philosophy
7614324 clearly this split is painful and clearly obama has shown himself to be a horrible leader for allowing this situation to go on and on as it has obama has only hurt himself by not making peace
7614325 dont think mccain fiorina wont attract mainstream dems who cant believe that their party has succumbed to the siren song of an untested amateur with a good speech
7614326 ddawd that is why we dont elect presidents based on the views of a few wacked out liberals and journalists we allow the country as a whole to decide and hence the rare election of liberals to high office
7614327 i think the vast majority of them are women who supported cltinon simply becasue she was a woman
7614328 assuming all the clintonistas who hate obama cwhos are real and not just the result of limbaugh fox meddling one is left to ask
7614329 voters not just wary of the eight years of george w bush but even many sick of the relentless back and forth between the two parties
7614330 throughout the race hillary clinton earned great respect for her courage as she compassionately spoke to the concerns of millions of americans she inspired millions of women and john mccain greatly respects her campaign and her work for all women very much
7614331 you are far exaggerating the case that obama ran against bill clinton during the primary and it is clear why you do this
7614332 if we examine the facts and the only tally that counts outside the yelling and screaming of the mindless dems carter lost in a landlside when he asked for re approval bush won
7614333 a mass hyponosis not seen since the last days of the weinmar republic
7614334 steers patients who dont have private insurance primarily poor black people to other health care facilities
7614335 the medical professionals who have come to me are accusing the university of dumping patients on its neighboring institutions
7614336 the worst speaker ever the worst president ever the biggest louse ever and the most unhappy rich person ever
7614337 the combination of these pluses and minuses suggests some degree of panic in the obama campaign
7614338 the other issue for obama is that healing the wounds of the primary is not entirely in his control
7614339 again medical science has determined that this horrific practice which is nothing short of infanticide is never necessary
7614340 the dollar wants to pull oil lower and the storm wants to pull it higher its a bit of a tug of war right now
7614341 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally
7614342 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7614343 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7614344 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7614345 we were friends before we were a couple and were always going to be friends
7614346 we have two amazing kids together kevin is my boy
7614347 i hope she does it i hope she goes for it and kills it
7614348 britney was even asking how to work the thermometer to take his temperature
7614349 when kevin wouldnt take her calls britney started text messaging him and kept texting him for much of the night
7614350 when you can get the police chief of lenexa or overland park to meet with their legislators and say heres the program we want and i can tell you why it makes a difference that connection moves the legislature forward

7614397 los grandes distribuidores y la industria pesquera pueden y deben ir hacia pol ticas de compra sostenibles y dejar de proveerse de especies de esta lista roja
7614398 estamos pidi ndoles que adopten una pol tica en que retiren lo peor de la lista roja que apoyen lo mejor ofreciendo productos sustentables y que mejoren la informaci n sobre las especies que venden
7614399 los consumidores tienen el derecho a que los supermercados les garanticen que todos los productos son sostenibles ya que ellos no tienen acceso a toda la informaci n necesaria
7614400 cuando comenzamos en mi pa s ten amos tres supermercado designados como naranja una categor a entre el ptimo que es el verde y el peor que es el rojo y hoy ya tenemos nueve
7614401 dicen que es imposible saber de donde viene el producto eso no es verdad ellos tienen toda la informaci n que simplemente deciden no proporcionarla a los consumidores
7614402 el listado es una herramienta f cil y eficiente tanto para consumidores como para la industria y todos los sectores interesados en garantizar el futuro de la pesca
7614403 comprobamos que tres cuartas partes de los oc anos est n agotadas
7614404 no se trata de eso sino de entender que el bacalao del oc ano atl ntico simplemente podr desaparecer y que los portugueses y otros pueblos amantes de este pescado pueden comprar el bacalao de chile porque esas especies del sur del oc ano pac fico no est n en peligro
7614405 es comer especies que se recuperan f cilmente y que no hacen parte de la lista roja

7614410 weve all been caught up in a horrible situation not of our making
7614411 all of us sunama the children are all victims of what happened
7614412 the authorities overseas should be held responsible for carefully checking all the agencies and making sure that their credentials are absolutely beyond any kind of doubt
7614413 i feel for sunama to the greatest extent because she was the one who lost the children
7614414 and for the children because theyve had to come to terms with a fundamental part of their identity being changed

7614419 the collective voice of the iaff will be a tremendous boost to the momentum that is building for the establishment of state and national catastrophe funds
7614420 comprehensive and integrated catastrophe programs at the state and national levels are essential if american families are going to be protected from the devastation of massive earthquakes or sweeping hurricanes
7614421 state legislators and the u s congress need to move now to enact laws that improve mitigation and preparation provide dedicated funding for first responder training and equipment and provide a financial backstop so families can repair rebuild and recover in the aftermath of a catastrophe

7614424 mischa and taylor were at a table on the patio with several friends
7614425 she was chain smoking and enjoying a glass of white wine which over the course of two hours was followed by at least five more her speech became more slurred with each drink and her head began falling onto taylors chest
7614426 at one point she tried to move from her chair to a nearby couch but stumbled headfirst into the couch taylor was mortified he snapped at her mischa come on youre making a fool of yourself people can see how drunk you are he demanded that she stop drinking but she only mumbled incoherently
7614427 people think chace is gay and thought i was gay that we were humping its not true but hilarious people project their fantasies onto people ive never been someone who makes it my objective to go out and pick up chicks but ive met some fantastic ladies here you know those amazing conversations where you find yourself in a caf talking until 2 a m and never see them again
7614428 there are perks to this job we the gossip girl cast were all thrown into this situation with a lot of attention on us and you get a lot of free clothes and s t but thats no reason not to stay grounded what am i really doing baby saving the world nah im on television
7614429 chuck is an iconic character and the clothes are iconic i think i rock the look well my style has always been good top notch baby i like the glamorous indie rock look like the libertines but you know without the heroin needle sticking out of my arm
7614430 would you just tell me the two or three things that you need to hear me say today to make you buy just tell me so that we can get this part out of the way go ahead im listening

7614435 the least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it
7614436 meanings are not determined by situations but we determine ourselves by the meanings we give to situations
7614437 the essence of intelligence is skill in extracting meaning from everyday experience
7614438 meaning is not what you start with but what you end up with
7614439 our obligation is to give meaning to life and in doing so to overcome the passive indifferent life
7614440 what we see depends mainly on what we look for
7614441 what we see depends upon what is meaningful to us
7614442 if you hate a person you hate something in him that is a part of yourself what isnt part of ourselves doesnt disturb us
7614443 love is just a word until someone comes along and gives it meaning
7614444 if i could tell you what it meant there would be no point in dancing it
7614445 i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not the parts that others play
7614446 ultimately man should not ask what the meaning of his life is but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked
7614447 todays consumers want to know about the latest products and the science behind them so we will meet their needs with intelligent and sophisticated news and features on anti ageing products and services from around the globe
7614448 most people would go to rats and mice for lab testing but when it comes to testing new wound therapies or products and cosmetics that go on human skin pig skin is our closest alternative and is most often used
7614449 however this is expensive the test numbers are limited and of course there are ethical problems to consider so using a human skin equivalent will reduce this use and possibly give more accurate results
7614450 we deconstruct the skin and its cells and then reconstruct them we cannot use the skin cut offs themselves as they are dying and we need to get the cells back to a state where they are growing healthily again
7614451 many african countries have struggled against rigged elections and authoritarian rule since gaining independence last century however african observers say the growth of simple communication technologies like cell phones are assisting many states to progress towards open and fair elections in increasingly democratic systems senegal is one of a number of african countries to hold successful elections by keeping voting and counting in check through independent communication
7614452 in an effort to establish any form of contact with someone back on the ground he phoned a controller at the cork airport and spoke only momentarily of his troubles before losing voice signal
7614453 cement new user input methods and ways of interaction that a mass amount of consumers essentially the world will be able to easily adapt and learn how to naturally use if inconsistent patterns emerge during apples research and development then its safe to say that we as end users will never see them
7614454 ya know we were all just using these phones everyday that sucked thats when we knew we needed to reinvent the mobile phone market
7614455 i just hope nobody else has to go through something like this in their life
7614456 people have to be very careful about who they befriend and let into their homes because you never know

7614484 concluding remarks in the fema report on the wtc 7 collapse lend support to my arguments the specifics of the fires in wtc 7 and how they caused the building to collapse
7614485 at building 7 there was no fire there whatsoever but there was one truck putting water on the building but it collapsed completely
7614486 the cars that were right down there were unbelieveable they were twisted and melted into nothing
7614487 for the third time today its reminiscent of those pictures weve all seen too much on television before a building was deliberately destroyed
7614488 i remember getting a call from the er fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire and i said weve had such terrible loss of life maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it and they made the decision to pull and we watched the building collapse
7614489 further research investigation and analyses are needed to resolve this issue
7614490 final report on the collapse of world trade center building 7
7614491 video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oil fires played a role in the collapse of wtc 7
7614492 i nferences made in establishing the model are checked by observing if the model behaves as expected
7614493 its amazing how cost saving projects move to the front of the line when these companies come under commodity cost pressures
7614494 you are seeing a number of companies across the board really start to cut back on any type of discretionary spending in order to maintain margin levels
7614495 it really gave us an option we didnt have before
7614496 the british are certainly happy to splash out on looking good

7614517 physically he wasnt right to go if he went back on the field he was only going to let somebody down we didnt expect him to come back on but we were short and he was going to come back on when michael jennings went down before recovering and continuing to play to send him back on when the game wasnt on the line would have been silly of me as a coach
7614518 i want to know whether he was injured or not im only going on the same rumour you blokes are going on with what has been surrounding him anyway talk that he wants out or he doesnt want out im sure mick leary and fellow penrith executive glenn matthews will see if theres anything in it
7614519 i was just talking to him about how he was he was cranky about his shoulders he said he wanted to be booked in for surgery this week he needs an arthroscopy to establish the full extent of the damage and then probably a reconstruction
7614520 i dont know where that came from he said he was injured and i believe him

7614630 i have called captain nick faldo and told him of my decision and hope that my performance so far this year will earn one of his two wildcard picks
7614631 two years ago the local chamber of commerce and our extension office commissioned a survey of what area businesses liked and disliked about muhlenberg county
7614632 overwhelmingly the respondents said they wanted to see a more vibrant arts community with more opportunities for young people to get involved in cultural activities
7614633 weve seen the success that pike and greenup counties have enjoyed and the positive difference their residents say these arts programs have made in their communities
7614634 here in muhlenberg county we listened to what people in the community were telling us and knew that we could and should develop a similar initiative
7614635 we congratulate the citizens of the county and the local business community for the commitment they have made to support the arts here
7614636 and today we also pay tribute to dean of the extension jimmy henning and to the late director of the uk cooperative extension service larry turner for their vision and drive to reach out to rural areas of our state in a truly revolutionary way
7614637 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7614638 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7614639 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7614640 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7614641 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7614642 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7614643 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7614644 i think its the number one thing that brings frustration anxiety and knots in your stomach all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it is presented on paper
7614645 those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are
7614646 i think i had more fear because i knew how bad it could be and i knew how i felt the last time wanting to have a natural birth and not having it because i had an epidural and feeling disappointed in myself
7614647 the worst part was the recovery it was really really long because the delivery was really really long
7614648 what we learned was very generic i just didnt have any skills to draw on no action plan
7614649 some women become so relaxed they dont experience pain at all
7614650 generally in north american society people expect labour to go badly and they expect you to have an epidural and they expect you to have some kind of pain relief unlike in other cultures where childbirth is regarded as natural and normal
7614651 and even if there is a positive aspect of a birth that had an epidural or had an intervention the baby came out healthy and the mother was so happy people dont focus on that part they focus on the negative the labour was so horrible and long
7614652 hypnobirthing is the opposite its just an expectation that you can do it
7614653 i think thats the main point actually of the whole thing to believe in your bodys ability to have babies
7614654 given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke of burning incense these findings carry significant public health implications
7614655 besides initiatives to reduce incense smoke exposure future studies should be undertaken to identify the least harmful types of incense
7614656 as a high hazard to humans and as having a high likelihood of exposure to individuals in canada
7614657 the health effects associated with exposure to degme are primarily developmental and reproductive toxicity and hematological effects based on observations in experimental animals
7614658 options for risk management for 2 mea among others would be to investigate measures to reduce or eliminate the very small amount currently in use in canada and limit any future uses
7614659 currently not entering or likely to enter the environment as a result of commercial activity
7614660 people have lost relatives perhaps their grandfather or great grandfather and they dont know what he was going through
7614661 these letters have helped they can engage with their ancestor
7614662 its been absolutely amazing just how they engaged with harry
7614663 its kind of like a big thriller mystery that keeps me really enticed
7614664 i think his blog is extremely important because of the stuff hes writing about nobody can tell you about firsthand what its like when they are all gone
7614665 i think most of the world war i books are dire
7614666 there comes a point when you start wondering about your family where you came from and what sort of people your antecedents were
7614667 philippebecker continues to grow for a simple reason our teams exceptionally strategic brand building expertise continues to produce homeruns in the marketplace these successes have engendered our clients loyalty and fostered true partnerships
7614668 very useful a good time for reflection as we get ready for the new school year and to think about how to implement what we learned
7614669 you can also base the tags on lifecycles locations anything and the tagging works for both physical and virtual environments
7614670 for production migrations many customers may find that the capacity planning features greater release support etc that existing partner products such as platespins powerrecon and powerconvert or hps proliant essentials server migration pack offer may be an even better solution but xenconvert makes it easier to get started and is a great solution for many users
7614671 by default orlando uses round robin mode load balancing so both routes will have active traffic on them during normal operation multipathing can be enabled in xencenter or on the command line
7614672 we are naturally aligned with storage vendors because we use the features they build into their products and give users visibility of vms from the storage domain and wherever storage vendors offer management features we use them with xenserver this is the exact opposite of what vmware does
7614673 the storage industry is really fed up with vmware and we are far ahead of them in this area
7614674 citrixs public proclamations that they will fully support hyper v have caused some to question their commitment to xenserver so i understand the concerns
7614675 still citrix has poured a ton of effort into the upcoming xenserver 4 2 and i think the 4 2 release will mark the moment organizations start looking seriously at xenserver for production workloads keep in mind that xenserver has features that hyper v doesnt have today such as live migration
7614676 i called on the organization that oversees ob gyn board certification to alter its guidelines their answer was dodgy and unsatisfying
7614677 come era prevedibile da oggi la situazione del traffico per la chiusura di via aniello falcone nellambito dei collegamenti tra il vomero ed il centro ha gi palesato le prime difficolt
7614678 la soluzione quella di accelerare al massimo lesecuzione delle opere continua capodanno lavorando pure di notte su tre turni ed incrementando il numero di operai al lavoro
7614679 molti automobilisti e motociclisti puntualizza capodanno al rientro dalla ferie non erano neppure a conoscenza del provvedimento di chiusura
7614680 per risolvere in maniera definitiva lendemico problema del traffico nellarea collinare conclude capodanno non vi altra soluzione che varare al pi presto la tanto attesa zona a traffico limitato delle quale si parla da due anni a questa parte e che finalmente stando alle dichiarazioni dellassessore al ramo sembra stia per arrivare ai nastri di partenza
7614681 whats the absolute minimum high school kids should know about personal finance
7614682 if people are still making digs at the hillary clinton people because we supported her that is not going to bring us on board it makes us feel as though were outsiders and were democrats
7614683 the litmus test for being black is seen as supporting barack
7614684 i said then 35 000 people drank the kool aid he said barack is a clean cut guy he never liked gutter politics thats why the clintons did so and so i said i dont want to get into this so i went over to the elevator and he said uncle tom
7614685 sono stato frainteso da qualcuno anzi qualche blog personale sito giornale ha speculato sul caso invece di confrontarsi con linteressato ha fatto riflessione e critica a senso unico persone serie prima di scrivere o addirittura di supporre delle cose e leggere nella mente degli altri dovrebbero chiedere e informarsi direttamente dagli interessati il diritto di critica legittimo purch non si offenda n si minacci n si manchi di carit e di rispetto alle persone ne si usano stratagemmi per far passare le proprie idee e posizioni come superiori agli altri razionali equilbrate sensate assolute cariche di verit specie se si possiedono strumenti potenti come i media di ogni genere e si nel cuore e nella stima dei potenti in questo settore
7614686 nel confermare la mia idea originaria che quella di portare maggiore attenzione sul mondo delle suore spesso non considerate e non adeguatamente valorizzate nella societ mi auguro che quanti operano per bloccare ogni iniziativa facciano davvero qualcosa per le suore molti monasteri in italia stanno morendo per mancanza di vocazioni come sacerdote e religioso il mio dovere lo svolgo in pieno contrariamente a quanti scrivono su di me senza sapere chi sono e cosa faccio non omettendo nulla di quanto mi compete di fare come persona consacrata e come passionista mi auguro che gli altri facciano molto di pi di me per il bene di quella chiesa che tutti amiano e serviamo con carismi e doni diversi la gelosia e linvidia sono cattive bestie che associate allorgoglio e alla presunzione di possedere la verit comunque e sempre non fa progredire il mondo e soprattutto le idee e i progetti per il futuro bisogna avere il coraggio di osare non solo con le idee ma anche con le azioni nel rispetto di tutti e di ognuno soprattutto nel rispetto di ogni persona umana perch tutti siamo degni di rispetto davanti a dio e ai fratelli che credono e amano davvero e non solo in questi casi in cui i media possono affascinare qualcuno e non certamente a me ed esporci alla lode o al disprezzo

7614694 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7614695 we will not accept to put the lives of our sons on the line by guaranteeing absolute immunity for anybody whether iraqis or foreigners
7614696 it still has to go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7614697 until we have a deal we dont have a deal
7614698 us state department spokesman robert wood told reuters the negotiators had only agreed on a draft agreement
7614699 it still has to go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7614700 we have nothing against the technology we just dont want that delivery system
7614701 they seem to think our community is their open job site
7614702 it is their contention they are not required to do so its our contention that they are

7614714 preliminary ridership reports show that muni had over 117 000 additional boardings this weekend which included three giants games at at amp t park and the outside lands music and arts festival in golden gate park on opposite ends of the city
7614715 at the same time that more than 100 000 music revelers were heading for the three day music festival at golden gate park

7614718 san francisco is one of the greenest cities on the planet

7614720 the jury is still out how big shale is going to be
7614721 once the missile defense system is put in place it will work automatically with the entire nuclear capability of the united states it will be an integral part of the us nuclear capability and for the first time in history and i want to emphasize this there will be elements of the us nuclear capability on the european continent it simply changes the whole configuration of international security of course we have to respond to that
7614722 us missiles in europe beyond deterrence to first strike threat
7614723 by means of a us first strike about 99 of russian nuclear forces would be taken out
7614724 some people have the illusion that you can do everything just as you want regardless of the interests of other people of course it is for precisely this reason that the international situation gets worse and eventually results in an arms race but we are not the instigators we do not want it why would we want to divert resources to this and we are not jeopardizing our relations with anyone but we must respond name even one step that we have taken or one action of ours designed to worsen the situation there are none we are not interested in that we are interested in maintaining a good atmosphere
7614725 it would be better to look for other ways to fight terrorism than create low yield nuclear weapons that lower the threshold for using these weapons and thereby put humankind on the brink of nuclear catastrophe
7614726 i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

7614809 angelos corned beef hash is quite delicious and satisfying just so long as you know that its satisfaction comes mostly from the thick well oiled potatoes that are its main ingredient the corned beef is more an adornment for them than the focus of attention

7614908 the atm wasnt working so i walked another 50 yards to another machine withdrew money then returned to find my car gone
7614909 it would only have been three or four minutes i didnt lock the car and i left the keys in it so im totally in the wrong

7614925 units ended up selling for less than 300 per sf and between 400 500k per unit most were 3br but there were some 2br units as well the auction psychology was interesting too as the first few buyers lost about 30 60k by bidding early because the same units were selling for less about an hour later

7614970 bush daddy has kept pestering me about the issue of living dismemberment probably thinking that this is what it means when psalm 53 5 says that god will scatter the bones of those camping against you bush daddy says this means that the limbs of the designated target will be duct taped and cut off each time the person revives another limb will be cut off and or shortened until he or she succumbs
7614971 as i learned when i tried for an ncaa championship in 1974 sports are not worth anything with bush nazis in the works

7614985 look you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless hear o earth i am bringing disaster on this people the fruit of their schemes because they have not listened to my words
7614986 its just a little bit its not going to kill you
7614987 dr francis cheney 1848 is also eulogized as one of the notable men of early dryden and that probably explains the cheney connection at the white house
7614988 these are the sh theads you want listen to them they talk like idiots

7614993 this changes the strategic relationship between the us and poland there is a clear and explicit understanding that if there are negative consequences of stationing the missile shield the us will come to polands defense
7614994 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia its to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
7614995 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow can launch following a first strike its a crucial element to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for ten interceptor missiles in poland but once established their number could be easily increased
7614996 guarantee s a us edge to carry out nuclear war without risking a counter strike
7614997 were at war against determined enemies and we must not rest until that war is won
7614998 stands for freedom around the world now the world must stand for freedom in georgia
7614999 every nation in every region now has a decision to make either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
7615000 no one with good intentions towards us and the west should
7615001 moscows willingness to crush georgia with overwhelming force and claims the kremlin has 10 times as many tactical short range warheads as the us
7615002 pugnacious russia determined to acquire economic and military power and not afraid to use threats and force to get its way with nuclear weapons central to the russian geopolitical calculus
7615003 the dark days of communist yore and captures the threat of what we and russias neighbors are up against
7615004 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
7615005 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
7615006 nato can act to stabiliz e this very dangerous situation
7615007 now is the time for action not just words russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
7615008 making putin pay and turning russias georgian rout into a political defeat
7615009 to remove president saakasvili from the office to which he was elected in 2004 and to overthrow a democratic government
7615010 western authorities to explore the vulnerability of russian assets abroad or at least make life difficult for the holders of those assets
7615011 in the world of global commerce china calculated that staging an olympic extravaganza could enhance its ambivalent reputation by contrast the putin government seems to believe its power grows in sync with its reputation as an international pariah an outsider state
7615012 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
7615013 russian tanks rolling through georgia with images of chechnya in 1994 and 99 vilnius 91 afghanistan 79 prague 68 hungary 56
7615014 the war in georgia marks an easy return to territorial expansion and attempted regional dominance
7615015 tried to give russians an alternative narrative he put forward democracy as a unifying and legitimizing idea for the new russian state
7615016 young democracies around russia back into moscows sphere of influence the worldview of a russian nationalist is hard for outsiders to comprehend
7615017 kremlin capitalism is a threat to the west by using its market strength in oil and gas resources to strong arm its neighbors and outmaneuver the us and eu
7615018 is to replace a pro western government with a new russian satellite reminiscent of the brezhnev doctrine its part of a broader campaign to annex new territory expand the russian empire conduct cyber attacks against the baltic states assassinate enemies and use economic intimidation through cutoffs of russian oil and gas shipments to ukraine and the czech republic it is important that moscow pays a concrete and tangible price for its latest aggression at least comparable to what it paid for the 1979 invasion of afghanistan
7615019 burned and houses broken unburied bodies lay rotting fresh graves were dug in gardens and basements most victims interviewed were ethnic georgians in central georgian villages some killings were carried out for revenge some involved theft and still others seemed to be that the power balance was shifting away from ethnic georgians to the ossetian separatists and their russian backers
7615020 georgians living in several of the villages said the russians occupying their land had treated them well done nothing to encourage them to leave and offered the only protection available from the south ossestian militias they feared most
7615021 us sees much to fear in a hostile russia by usher ing in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west problems extend ing far beyond arms deals with syria and the mountains of georgia
7615022 the hegemon in that region and we are not and thats a fact
7615023 any kind of coercive actions like economic sanctions or anything else
7615024 abkhazia rallie d for independence and the abkhazian parliament has approved an official appeal to russia to recognize its independence
7615025 russia is always with you and will never leave you in the lurch
7615026 the kremlin is nearing formal recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia possibly as early as next week
7615027 support is likely and that after all the events that have occurred one should not expect otherwise
7615028 appealed to russia and to governments of other countries to recognize abkhazias independence
7615029 express such a will and if the russian president makes a relevant decision on this score
7615030 again said they will never agree to remain within georgia
7615031 in accordance with the international agreements to their previous places of deployment
7615032 envisaged in the international agreement poti is outside of the security zone
7615033 but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in hummers
7615034 we have registered an increase in georgian reconnaissance activities and preparations for armed actions in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
7615035 temporarily suspending military cooperation with nato until a political decision on relations
7615036 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately
7615037 local s ossetian and abkhazian population said they fear georgia might repeat its regional aggression they also want russian troops to stay in the area to shield them from any possible attacks
7615038 to deter looters and the transportation of arms and ammunition
7615039 the eurasian corridor pipeline geopolitics and the new cold war

7615051 obama has picked someone who is going to be very aggressive in going after mccain and who is not going to be recalcitrant about it
7615052 if i was mccain id be thinking about my own attack dog
7615053 hes going to want someone who can go toe to toe with biden
7615054 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate

7615090 but for now we had to stop with that process because it bidding was definitely over and we have to provide the best value for taxpayers money
7615091 we realize the challenges that are coming and this is why i want to en sure that its still a top priority for our government and we will do every thing that we can to speed up the proc esses
7615092 we heard a lot of noise on the ground since last friday
7615093 and i thought it was important to rectify some points

7615194 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
7615195 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed
7615196 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded onto a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost the transfer of data on this assignment to the external contractor has been suspended
7615197 we are collaborating closely with the home office on this matter we have no further comment to make at this time
7615198 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
7615199 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
7615200 the home office has informed us that an internal investigation is being carried out into the data security arrangements between the home office and its contractor pa consulting we expect the home office to provide us at the information commissioners office with a copy of the report and its findings we will then decide what further action may be appropriate searching questions must be answered about what safeguards were in place to protect this information

7615202 it is always fun to start the year with the dual meet against ut
7615203 the natural rivalry adds some extra excitement and we very rarely get to go head to head with one team so it is a nice change for us when we can compete head to head against one team as opposed to a large pack of runners
7615204 this first race of the season is a shorter race than usual for both squads
7615205 the men are starting with a 5k and women a 3k the race is also one week earlier in the training schedule for us this year so we are using it as more or less a time trial or sorts to see where everyone is at and to give our student athletes the opportunity to experience a race situation
7615206 our womens team has very high expectations after finishing 2nd in 2006 and then running very well last season without top runner jamie roflow
7615207 the team is eager to get back out and race now that jamie has returned and everyone has had one more year to get stronger we have a strong group of returning athletes and add a solid freshman class with saisha gailliard sally jerop and agnes kibor
7615208 our mens team then is young but they are excited and have worked hard all off season
7615209 our main focus to start will be on individual and team improvements from week to week and making sure we continue to improve as the season progresses we feel it will be a good year for us though returning a solid group and adding a large freshman class to the mix
7615210 i was very happy with the way the women raced this event last season but we had way too big of a gap between our four and five runners and that cost us
7615211 but i was happy with how they closed that up and obviously ran an outstanding race for a freshman it was a very impressive performance by her and she showed a lot of confidence and composure
7615212 obviously on the mens side we let them get away from us too much on the second mile and it allowed them to go two three and four on and that cost us
7615213 they know that they got to get in there and battle when it comes time to battle this season
7615214 they are a very positive group though and im excited to work with them
7615215 i would just like to invite everyone to all our home competitions this fall
7615216 having the crowd support is a great help to the teams and our student athletes and staff are very grateful for those who do come and show their support

7615402 so this is where the risk lies because you cant know in advance what that predisposition would be unless you would do a genetic test which is not standard routine at this point so while it would not be a problem in all cases i would say that codeine cannot be considered a safe drug for some mothers who are breast feeding their infants
7615403 the basic nature of this finding does not surprise me given that this is where science is going with a huge effort being made to better understand the interaction of ones genes with exposure to various substances and its not unheard of for this kind of science to lead to an altering of ob gyn practice it should be said for example that it wasnt so long ago in the 60s and 70s that women were actually given alcohol to stop premature labor so the possibility that this is true does create a burden to do the appropriate testing before we make such prescriptions

7615502 our group stayed together to the very end and we treated each other gently and respectfully
7615503 i found out that they the sudanese women were very very young one of them could have been in her 20s another in her 30s and their spouses had only been bishops for a few weeks but they have experienced war danger and losing people they have experienced poverty they want their children to be educated but theres no guarantee its good to have a reality check to see the lives my sisters bishops wives have

7615509 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it

7615524 the next stage we are thinking about is to wirelessly recharge devices like laptops and cell phones so we are shrinking the size of the coils down to the size of laptops

7615527 you can now open your eyes ears and soul to a multitude of sounds and sights from all over the net
7615528 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
7615529 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

7615531 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
7615532 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
7615533 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
7615534 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
7615535 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
7615536 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
7615537 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
7615538 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
7615539 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
7615540 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
7615541 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
7615542 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
7615543 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
7615544 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
7615545 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

7615628 because high cell density increases contractility across the entire cell layer these findings suggested that tumor capillary cells are inherently hyper contractile
7615629 in this study weve uncovered a previously unrecognized role for tumor capillary cell mechanosensing and contractility in the formation of irregular tumor vessels and have identified potential new targets for vascular normalization therapy that might be implemented in the clinic someday

7615663 i give chip ganassi a lot of credit he came into the team meeting today and hes got a lot of guests here from target and we wanted to perform well scotts dixon obviously in the championship hunt and he gave us the order that we were going to do something very alternative and we did and it just kind of played out perfectly it was a great job from him and everybody the pit stops were really good it was just one of those races there was a pretty clear track most of the time so it worked out we started in the back it is so difficult trying to pass tony kanaan was really slow at the end but he was quick enough in the right places so it was hard to pass it was a good day for target chip ganassi racing its unfortunate for scott he was quick all weekend thats the thing with these tracks its hard to overtake hes one of the best guys out there i think its the strategy that cost him but hell bounce back and he knows hes got a strong teammate in his corner to look after him
7615664 im not upset with anybody particularly we just did absolutely nothing right i dont know why we stayed out when the car in front of us was three seconds slower and we couldnt make up any track position everything we did was wrong we still lost a ton of points this is a race thats very tough hopefully well turn it around next time it was definitely a bad day i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week

7615724 creators and studios will be able to set the final prices on their titles but were expecting most standard length titles to be around 99 and were encouraging creators to give away the first issues of their titles to allow new readers who may not be familiar with comics but are iphone ipod touch owners to give comics on the devices a try
7615725 with digital comics on the iphone ipod touch we have access to a world wide audience no printing costs or print run minimums and it doesnt take 3 months to get the title from in the catalog to on sale in a store each title will be featured as its own application in the app store and will be backed up onto the readers desktop or notebook computer each time they sync their device

7616070 in some ways that the baghdad government feels more confident and less as if it has to agree to almost any us demand because without us troops it will be quickly be swept away is good news

7616215 you know i think you have such great just great great but i wasnt you know feeling that good stuff in my stomach when you said that part about nuclear weapons caches in the former soviet union

7616221 if chris destroys another opponent people are really going to be clamoring especially if gina gets in and clobbers hers its just really about letting the fighters develop letting them grow in their skills and their character development in order for them to eventually meet one another
7616222 it could be but weve got a couple ideas and were not fully committed to exactly how thats going to be
7616223 but were committed to an early 2009 ppv event thats what this is really all about isnt it

7616225 having a pro abortion a pro gay rights pro tax pro bigger government person in the white house is just not something alabamians i believe will stand for
7616226 if anything heaven forbid obama is the president i think it could actually help us in our efforts because well be able to tie all of the democrats in montgomery to the democrats in washington
7616227 if they just like the word and they just think they wish things were better im not sure that would move them to obama
7616228 you have to see something fundamentally wrong with the system mccain does not make that argument he makes the argument that he can do things better
7616229 unfortunately its not uncommon in government to find left hands and right hands that dont know what each other are doing

7616235 when it comes across their desks that this person has been charged with a sex abuse case i think its their obligation to follow through and see that its revoked
7616236 you dont just say its not my job because that way it never gets done it should be the education departments job
7616237 i think if there were no other precautions that were being made then id be concerned

7616240 that a woman has to make with her doctor and her god
7616241 crops which have been genetically engineered to date include maize soya beans canola derived from rapeseed and potatoes many biotech companies would like to genetically engineer wheat if this is pushed through
7616242 the bread must be wheaten only and recently made so that there is no danger of corruption
7616243 for example people who suffer coeliac disease are unable to absorb gluten a protein found in wheat eating even small amounts of wheat can make them ill
7616244 in recent decades it has been possible to extract the gluten from wheaten bread so that people can eat bread without endangering their health despite the fact that gluten wheat poses a health threat which can often be serious the congregation of the doctrine of the faith stated in a reply in 1982 that the local ordinary could not permit a priest to consecrate special gluten free hosts for the communion of coeliacs
7616245 people can get sick from hosts therefore the church should change its divinely instituted teaching that only wheat hosts are valid matter for the eucharist right
7616246 special hosts quibus glutinum ablatum est from which gluten has been removed are invalid matter for the celebration of the eucharist
7616247 given the centrality of the celebration of the eucharist in the life of the priest candidates for the priesthood who are affected by coeliac disease or suffer from alcoholism or similar conditions may not be admitted to holy orders
7616248 genetically engineered wheat will have an added protein which will make it tolerant to the herbicide of a biotech company
7616249 this raises questions whether it is lawful to use gm wheat as matter for the eucharist if notwithstanding a pressing health need the congregation of the doctrine of the faith refused to sanction gluten free hosts as valid matter for the eucharist because a protein has been extracted from the wheat how can it sanction genetically engineered wheat which has an added protein designed to make it resistant to a weed killer
7616250 i think its extremely important just to keep making forward progress rather than trying prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
7616251 obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here

7616259 i am concerned about the audience and acceptance time will tell well see they always tried for a fourth judge because it followed the format of the original show pop idol we havent had much luck with that working but were gonna give it another try
7616260 it takes the fun out of all the hard work i do to push those kids through
7616261 the cardboard with the dot was a signal for the defensive front and the hand signal was for the coverage
7616262 they varied the hand signals a little bit from the previous year but it wasnt real hard to figure out
7616263 not exactly complex stuff but were talking about defensive guys after all
7616264 its almost like im managing the game a little more because not everybody can see the signal anymore so it has to go through me
7616265 so i almost know that if its second and 7 10 minutes left in the second quarter they just ran a run play you figure more than likely theyre going to run a pass play maybe a quick run play in my head i have an idea what the coach is going to call and if theyre coming out before i get that signal in my headset ill just make the call
7616266 if the coordinator and the linebacker or whoever it is whos getting the play are on the same page it will give the player a little more insight into why the coach is thinking that or setting up this whatever it is its almost like a different type of relationship
7616267 whatever they try to do to us were going to be all right
7616268 you can go back to using signals from the sideline if they want to go fast the faster they go the less theyre going to be able to read your hand signals but i think its going to make everybody pretty focused on what youre trying to do
7616269 everybody has a pretty good understanding of situations how you want to play at certain times of the game you may get more of that now because not everybody is going to see the call right away its going to be good for players especially the guys who are really smart
7616270 if the offense is going really fast you cant wait for the signal you just have to line up
7616271 we did a good job of communicating the defense around pretty quick with just the radio system so that was good
7616272 he wants to get up to the line audible check out of something show you a lot of hand signals fake you out whatever
7616273 if they want to come to the line at 15 seconds thats fine then if the defense changes formation they might not have time to audible or check out of what theyre doing that works for the defense just fine
7616274 he suffered a small crack in one of the nose bones the bone was gently put back into place this morning under local anesthetic

7616283 some people want to be disrespectful and want to be interuptive for their own political gain
7616284 this event was not campaign related and it was shamefully and frankly sad that massa tried to turn the attention away from our first responders and back to himself
7616285 and the time for action is now the energy issue is the most critical our country has economically i hope changes will come before the end of the year
7616286 i understand you are trying to make this a political issue but youre not going to
7616287 he said this wasnt a political event today but his only staffer there was his campaign manager

7616358 biologists have known that in these beetles there is an investment trade off between secondary sexual characters and primary sexual characters
7616359 as horns get bigger copulatory organs get smaller or vice versa what was not known was how frequently and how fast this can occur in nature and whether this can drive the evolution of new species
7616360 in terms of the integrity of a species its important for these things not to change too much
7616361 so there is a lot of evidence suggesting that within species or within the populations of species natural selection maintains genital characters but if these primary sex characters are linked to other characters that can change readily then youve got what we think is a very exciting mechanism that could prime populations for reproductive isolation
7616362 if this is all it takes to change genitalia it may be easier to make new species than we thought

7616408 and because we love a friendly rivalry itll be fun to show the mannings what real dsrl competition is like theyre going down
7616409 spears will not be performing at the vmas this year im telling you officially and unequivocally
7616410 if they get information and it later turns out to be false it doesnt necessarily invalidate the search warrant
7616411 no i dont think so at all the camaro started out not being a production program we did this pure concept car theres a couple of different kinds of concept cars
7616412 theres the kind i call fake which are so called precursors when the real car has already been decided on and is already in the hopper and is about eight months away from production and you do a conceptualized version reducing the roof height a little bit putting bigger wheels on like we did with the cadillac provocq which now turns out to be the cadillac srx theyre a way of revealing most of the production intent of the car but making it a little more exciting and getting some advance press on it
7616413 then there are the other types of concept cars that start out as a pure concept just as a great idea sort of wouldnt that be nice with no intention of producing them whatsoever examples of that kind of car is the original dodge viper shown in 1989 the pontiac solstice shown in 2002 and the camaro a lot of times what happens with those is that the car guys within the company do that car because the only thing that has a chance of convincing the corporation that it might be a good thing to do is the overwhelming success and response to the concept car
7616414 the skeptics in the company say oh no jeez we shouldnt be wasting our money on that these pony cars are short lived once the concept is shown the company is bombarded with emails and letters and even your own board members start asking whats to prevent us from doing this
7616415 once we showed the concept and it got a good reception we moved the implementation phase and since we were starting from scratch the concept had in no way been designed in a way to enable easy production it was a special version of the zeta rear wheel drive architecture and nobody had a clue how to get wheels that big onto that architecture and so on
7616416 so under three years from concept to production is pretty darn fast i dont think that hurt the car in fact i think there is a very agreeable surprise on everybodys part that the production car looks almost identical
7616417 well there certainly has been a de emphasis because of the fuel economy rules we have to bias the mix towards the vehicles with the v6 engines and discourage the sale of large powerful v8s thats what weve always said about the cafe legislation it puts us at war with market demand gasoline is four dollars a gallon and maybe someday going to five and six the market will automatically gravitate to the smaller engined cars
7616418 but thats the point weve always been making that with fuel economy mandates without a concomitant increase in gasoline prices you are going to have cars that the public desperately wants and youre going to have to say to the public im sorry i cant give you one of those
7616419 thats a wheel for an automatic car they just threw in here

7616429 it has been an extremely difficult decision to take given my burning desire to represent europe again in defending the ryder cup in the united states
7616430 but the fact that boston this week is my only opportunity to qualify for the final two play off events as well as being my final opportunity to play my 15 events on the us pga tour conflicts with my ambition to play gleneagles and earn my spot in the team

7616456 ever since i was a youth ive always been searching for the truth
7616457 well i had my first pair of decks when i was 15 or i was into hip hop and got my first pair of technics on my 18th birthday i was a breakdancer and i did graffiti when i was going shopping in birmingham buying my hip hop stuff these new records were how i got into house music
7616458 thats a bit of hard one its just an interest in music i have always been into music when we were at school and hip hop came out i was always the person who had the stereo playing tapes it was just a fascination with music in my opinion its the djs who create the music at the end of the day they are defining whats happening when the scene took off i was already a dj i was already into house music or techno or whatever it was when it first came out it was never really an ambition like oh i wanna be a dj it just kind of happened simply because i was into music

7616489 this review of the mining act although welcome is very hasty and doesnt deal with the all important issue of uranium mining which really needs to be heard
7616490 the review terms of reference were unilaterally announced and the hearings started almost immediately within just a few days of the announcement
7616491 there was no opportunity for input in that regard and the provincial government seems intent on exploiting this jurisdictional confusion over uranium to avoid the thorny issue of uranium mining in eastern ontario

7616580 one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of american life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment the gangster movie come of age truly sorrowful exciting without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago
7616581 the daring of part ii is that it enlarges the scope and deepens the meaning of the first film visually part ii is far more complexly beautiful than the first just as its thematically richer more shadowed fuller an epic vision of the corruption of america
7616582 coppolas superior sequel to his own very fine mafia epic is an elliptical and elegantly orchestrated narrative charted with a terrifying lucidity the performances gordon willis memorably gloomy camerawork the stately pace and the sheer scale of the storys sweep render everything engrossing and so well plausible that our ideas of organised crime in america will forever be marked by this movie
7616583 uniquely idiosyncratic about as unpredictable from one moment to the next as any film i know aznavours piano player anticipates a whole range of modern movie characters from warren beattys clyde barrow to robert de niros travis bickle to robert forsters aging bail bondsman in
7616584 fantastic one of the key films of the french new wave a strange pastiche of gangster movie love story and cabaret film with a totally and calculatedly unpredictable plot the story is by turns comic and pathetic often flashing midstream from one mood to the other and aznavours performance as the wounded hero is a masterstroke of casting
7616585 over the course of 81 of the briskest minutes in cinema fran ois truffauts shoot the piano player contains flashbacks jump cuts weird superimpositions tender love scenes broad slapstick a snowbound shootout with feckless gangsters a sing along in a parisian piano bar and countless nods to american noirs and genre films at once more radical and more playful than any other film in truffauts career and brimming with inspired touches that still seem surprising after a dozen viewings much less one a movie shoot the piano player found a young director drunk on cinema and buying for the bar
7616586 filled with good and bad jokes bits from sacha guitry films clowns and thugs tough kids songs and fantasy and snow scenes and homage to the american b gangster pictures of the 40s and 50s nihilistic in attitude yet by its wits and its spirits its totally involved in life and fun nothing is clear cut the ironies crisscross and bounce
7616587 the tone is radically unstable accomodating slapstick bawdy singalongs what the hell cinematic trickery and some seriously goofy dialogue but its still as sad a movie as any jean gabin or g rard philipe ever expired in
7616588 teasing and amusing nuttiness pure and simple surges and swirls through this film the little ivory tickler is played by charles aznavour with an almost buster keaton like insistence on the eloquence of the deadpan
7616589 sophomore outings by major directors dont get much riskier or more playful than this around aznavours aloof honky tonk bar pianist reels a truly freewheeling dark little movie one that veers between throwaway gags and dour and sometimes violent tragedy it feels tr s modern its still a classic

7616615 is there a problem with iphones antenna is the coverage worse than for other mobiles there are many rumors on the internet in the usa someone is going to sue apple we took our iphone to a test chamber for fact finding
7616616 which sells test chambers for wireless devices with small antennas in a noise free metal chamber the mobile communicates with a simulated base station the equipment measures how the mobile sends and receives signals under different conditions for manufacturers and others who want to make a test the test is much faster and more reliable than travelling around to check the performance at different locations
7616617 bluetests chambers are used by among others mobile phone manufacturers such as motorola and tco which has a system for certifying mobiles
7616618 wired coms survey of iphone 3g users suggests that widespread data speed problems have more to do with carriers networks than with apples handsets
7616619 recently wired com asked iphone 3g users all around the world to participate in a study which involved testing their 3g speeds and entering their data on an interactive map the purpose to gain a general idea of how 3g was performing where its best and where its worst in light of widespread complaints about the handsets network performance more than 2 600 people participated wow and weve diligently cleaned up the data to present it to you
7616620 to speak very generally the data overall shows that 3g is performing faster than edge which is expected in the best scenarios 3g is up to seven times faster than edge in worse scenarios 3g performed just as slowly as edge at worst some users couldnt connect to 3g at all which isnt surprising since 3g towers are not yet ubiquitous
7616621 in our view this data is a strong indicator that performance of the mobile carriers network is affecting the iphone 3g more than the handset itself this also furthers our thesis that its highly unlikely that apple is going to wave a magical wand and say 3g problems be gone with a software update before apple can make such a claim it needs to wait for all of its carriers to optimize 3g network behavior in terms of number of towers how theyre positioned and how much bandwidth each tower can handle
7616622 with the release of iphone 3g in july its usage market share rose markedly from 0 16 to 0 19 however when tracking weekly numbers the week of august 10 shows a huge surge in usage to 0 31 market share
7616623 wow thats a lot faster than the first generation phone

7616631 trulia one of the webs most visited home listing sites on aug 25 is introducing a tool available on apples iphone that can locate all the listings and open houses in a users vicinity
7616632 the free software application uses navigation technology to summon data and displays the results on an interactive map it lets users call up such information as price photos square footage and number of bedrooms another tap of the screen sends a call or e mail directly to the listing agent its all about convenience says trulia ceo pete flint
7616633 trulia which boasts information for 70 to 80 of the properties on the multiple listing service database of real estate listings will be the biggest listing site with an iphone application but its hardly alone frontdoor com says it will introduce an iphone application later this year that not only searches nearby listings but also integrates video and information about what its like to live in a given neighborhood
7616634 greg swann a broker for bloodhoundrealty com in phoenix says that while the trulia application may undermine the role of buyers agents it will probably be a boon to sellers agents and customers

7616646 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally
7616647 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7616648 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7616649 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries

7616690 so most departments will no longer have to take the bulk of their recyclables outside their immediate office area
7616691 in an audit conducted last year we found that up to 36 percent of the weight of the garbage cans on campus consisted of fluids with the average being 15 percent
7616692 in an effort to save money reduce contamination of our recyclables and keep garbage and recycling containers cleaner we are asking people to consume or use all of the liquids in the beverage containers or empty them out in a kitchen or bathroom sink
7616693 the reduction in liquids is also extremely helpful to custodial staff and members of the recycling crew who have to handle the garbage and recycling containers both of which can weigh significantly more with liquid in them

7616740 it was maybe an opportunity missed for the chinese to demonstrate their willingness to be more open and to allow more freedom of speech
7616741 so i would say perhaps were disappointed that they didnt take the full opportunity that was offered to them while the world was watching during these

7616749 we have a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here

7616770 had not yet achieved the complete reconciliation that we need
7616771 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us
7616772 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7616773 hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7616774 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7616775 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7616776 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
7616777 i am here because of the opportunities that my father had that my mother had you know we are who americans were supposed to be
7616778 now in a first for me im supporting a republican john mccain i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7616779 this ad does not reflect the sentiment of the thousands of former clinton supporters from my congressional district who have embraced barack obamas message of uniting americans and getting the country back on track
7616780 cheap political stunts like this ad show that john mccain is offering more of the same four more years of failed bush policies and a record of supporting george bush 95 of the time and losing track of how many houses he owns hillary clinton supporters are embracing barack obama and joe biden
7616781 theres nothing independent about having voted with george bush 95 of the time and there is little maverick about promising to continue george bushs failed economic policies and plan for an indefinite occupation of iraq

7616784 its due to our proactive policing tactics its because of our use of stop and search at points of entry
7616785 you would expect more arrests because were searching more people

7616815 intended to act as a catalyst for increased regional integration and to facilitate trade and investment flows within the region
7616816 some of the countries in the sadc are being prevented from fully benefiting from the gains of trade because of the size and nature of their economies by integrating countries are able to exploit scale economies while at the same time restructuring the regional economy in ways that benefit the production base of the region
7616817 the trade deficits in the region are in south africas favour mostly south african companies are moving into and benefiting in all sectors including communication tourism retail trade mining airlines banking et cetera
7616818 if there is a free trade area in the sadc region and the epas with its most favoured nation clauses are signed it will open the doors to european imports
7616819 it will be extremely difficult to monitor trade across porous borders whether it is goods from sadc or europe many of the sadc countries are willing to sign agreements which will undermine their own economic advancement the eu is insisting on the liberalisation of finances health and a number of services
7616820 most of the limited export sector of sadc countries is heavily biased towards the european markets eu countries threaten african countries with tariff raises on imported goods if the epas are not signed
7616821 it is simply not true that the fta will lead to european goods flooding the sadc markets the fta is about intra sadc trade and outsiders are precluded from benefiting from it through rules of origin
7616822 since 2000 sadc countries have been implementing the provisions of the sadc trade protocol
7616823 whether the customs union will become a reality within the next 18 months remains to be seen there is too little time left
7616824 this will help to boost industrial development and the diversification of the export base the fta may also help to reduce uncertainty and improve the financial credibility of countries in the region in turn this could boost private sector investment

7616881 in exchange he said to me that he would start winning matches
7616882 we must quickly get nantes out of this situation which has lasted for some weeks now
7616883 once again we made a catastrophic start by giving them a present five minutes in
7616884 we were passive at the start but we rectified that by defending better pressing further forward and creating two or three chances
7616885 we conceded the second goal at a set piece but we tried and i cant reproach my players
7616886 we have to be more opportunistic at the high level your mistakes get punished
7616887 i am not replying to these sort of questions people have been asking me that for a year so i no longer feel pressure
7616888 for us it is points lost after a strong second half with lots of goalscoring chances
7616889 but we did not do enough in the first half to win the game we wanted to control the game in the first 45 minutes but would have had to defend better to do that only being 2 0 down woke us up
7616890 i cant under our warner bros embargo talk about the ending
7616891 but i can tell you that you will not be interacting

7616910 while i hate galaxy girl was originally kat cahills runner up for our who wants to create a super heroine contest shadowline editor kris simon and i loved the concept so much we had to put it on the fast track to becoming its own series
7616911 when kat saw seths upcoming work on brat halla she knew he was the perfect artist to capture the mood she was going for we really cant help but agree
7616912 the core of i hate galaxy girl is renee finding the self confidence to achieve her dreams despite constantly being told to give up the experience is something i think just about anybody can relate to while the overall story is still a heck of a lot of fun
7616913 for us there is nothing else other than to learn for the future and congratulate our opponents
7616914 its a blow for the players at the break we wanted to maintain the same plan to have the ball and look to take control on the wings to settle the match but what happened was the opposite
7616915 however credit also has to go to madrid because they showed strength and faith in looking to bounce back
7616916 you need to learn from this so it doesnt happen again

7616926 wed sit in the dorm hall and talk about how we wanted to change the world we were a bunch of 18 and 19 year olds and disappointed in how conservative things were moving
7616927 he wanted to be in the kind of place new york city is where you walk down the street and turn the corner and youre in a new place
7616928 he brings both sides of the american story his father the immigrant his mothers side from the midwest
7616929 im concerned people still dont know him well enough and still feel uncertain about him

7616942 the storm is trying to pull the market higher but its not getting much of a boost
7616943 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally
7616944 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7616945 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7616946 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries

7616952 i did a show called peggy sue that david mirvish produced and it was done in london in the west end that was my move into the theatre world
7616953 it was important to us and particularly to me to respect the audience that stayed with us all these years and fell in love with it and protect those memories
7616954 we didnt get the kind of musical respect that some of the other bands of the time the beatles or the beach boys
7616955 but one thing that stuck with me was the fact that there was not one acknowledgement to a record or a song we made in the rolling stone 500 edition of all time great records
7616956 this has paid off in spades the fact that nobody really knows the story when you see jersey boys youre just in for a roller coaster ride theres lots of surprises
7616957 we werent glamour boys we didnt have a following that would buy anything we did

7616990 youre interests your looks your goals your faith in islam and your respect just overall youre very different from what ive heard about bengali guys from others
7616991 oh yeah i am different in way but is that a problem

7616996 david twowy right now is writing the scripts the only question is whether we take a page from the lord of the rings guys and try to shoot the two chapters at the same time there are two more in mind
7616997 the chronicles of riddick was presented as a three part trilogy that would answer pitch black in the same way that lord of the rings answered the hobbit
7616998 everyone knows i love the riddick character and im always working on it
7616999 it just takes five years to make another one because david twohy and i are so precious about it
7617000 sooner or later we all end up in the underverse
7617001 we are the only state to successfully defeat an anti gay ballot measure these are the lessons we learned
7617002 1 message we have learned how to research and find the messages that resonate with swing voters who are not already part of our base
7617003 2 messengers i hope that everyone in this room will join us as messengers to deliver the message to swing voters in targeted states
7617004 arizona florida and california are fighting marriage bans and each of those needs your support
7617005 it was maybe an opportunity missed for the chinese to demonstrate their willingness to be more open and to allow more freedom of speech freedom of religion while the world was watching
7617006 so i would say perhaps were disappointed that they didnt take the full opportunity that was offered to them while the world was watching during these olympics
7617007 i swear to allah that i do not know them they were strangers
7617008 one of the womens names was maybe fadhila and the other was called widad
7617009 no no they put it on me and told me to take it off at home
7617010 i did not disconnect it because maybe it fell off me
7617011 panelists discuss whether stringent new suicide vest laws would make sure only responsible people blow themselves up

7617013 the web page you attempted to visit was suspended because it was a phishing site lucky you weve disabled that site since you were tricked into visiting here please read the following information and learn how to avoid doing this again you may not be lucky twice
7617014 its actually a very difficult place to go sailing in theres two winds a gradient wind and a sea breeze and its very subtle
7617015 thierry pepponet matadors tactician and myself spent quite a lot of time before the start trying to fathom it out and it wasnt easy
7617016 i think if we get our act together this week we can be on the podium again the boat and team have the potential but you also need that little bit of luck to get the show rolling we are quite confident but not overly so as the competition is very tough but today we had some good practice starts and good speed so i think we have a good chance we will certainly work very hard to make it happen
7617017 the only shame is having done a half decent job today the whole thing will be very different tomorrow
7617018 were one of the most improved boats we were average to good at the start of the year and weve been getting stronger and stronger as the years gone on weve made lots of improvements including our techniques weve been a lot more active with our coaching we kind of knew we had to step it up weve got an eye on the regatta wed always be looking for a top three at the regatta and theres a reasonable chance that we could be a really strong boat in the audi medcup circuit overall as well two regattas to go and were in fifth spot but mean machine have dropped and out and were not too far behind
7617019 matador really wants to win this regatta which is tough on me
7617020 they finished second in the breitling regatta and they want a better result so that just leaves winning it is a lot of pressure but i like that and i am sure all the people on board and the boat can do it we will do all we can to achieve that goal
7617021 this of any of the events had us the most worried since it was such an unknown trying to get weather data or any historical perspective has been really tough but im pretty sure everyone has been through the same thing
7617022 getting good boatspeed is a never ending battle and identifying modes and today the main focus was getting everybody back communicating so we can start the team dynamics again the afterguard is made up of such diverse personalities so that was our biggest focus we never use our race sails for the practice race so are always maybe a touch off the pace
7617023 let me speak for hip hop im the one guy who is qualified to represent us to the masses which are obviously tired of us because hip hop often cant sell records
7617024 it can only sell ringtones its become a mockery of itself its become club music
7617025 for us to lead back into the marketplace and to be a respected art form i feel that im the most qualified person its time for hip hop to have a change
7617026 this attractive three storey property has traded for a number of years as a licensed snooker club although offered for sale with a licence and partly fitted the subjects offer scope for alternative use possibly residential redevelopment subject to local authority consents being obtained
7617027 the one message id like to leave with the public is please do your homework before you hire somebody and please hire a licensed contractor
7617028 we dont have the foot soldiers or the strength to really offset the tide
7617029 earnings estimate revisions are the most powerful force impacting stock prices
7617030 i am concerned about the audience and acceptance time will tell well see
7617031 they always tried for a fourth judge because it followed the format of the original show pop idol
7617032 we havent had much luck with that working but were gonna give it another try
7617033 im sure simon will get to make the final call
7617034 it takes the fun out of all the hard work i do to push those kids through
7617035 i need to do something so i can live to see my kids grow up

7617044 i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message

7617046 the supreme court is at stake our educational system needs the right kind of change weve got to become energy independent we have to create millions of new green collar jobs weve got so much work to do around the world
7617047 none of that will happen if john mccain is in the white house she suggested
7617048 i just want to make it absolutely clear we cannot afford four more years of george w bushs failed policies in america and thats what we would get with john mccain
7617049 she walked away and i said all you doubting thomases have to get on board
7617050 she turned around and said you called us and i said no thats not so i thought it was all over with she just caught the last word of what i said people make mistakes
7617051 the incredible pressure that had been put on particularly women to support barack obama
7617052 women in illinois had that pressure and it was particularly hard for african american women who were placed in the untenable position of having to chose between their race and between their gender
7617053 i just want to thank hillary clinton for staying in the race made us better supporters of barack obama made barack obama a better candidate

7617205 cracking down on fraud should be a top priority for medicare not fixing numbers to make an agency look better
7617206 this is taxpayer money and must be treated with integrity and reverence i expect hearings and i expect answers truthful answers from medicare about this report
7617207 while we agree with the inspector general that the medical equipment error rate we reported should have been higher allegations of manipulation of this error rate are preposterous
7617208 in addition the 3 billion figure for improper medical equipment payments is an unsupported extrapolation at this time because the report only cited percentages
7617209 everyone is royally upset at the way that medicare is trying to scam congress by telling us theyre fighting fraud when theyre telling their auditors to ignore government policies on audits to make themselves look better

7617357 one of them is that the waters are warmer and global warming has created an issue that the jellies like another one is overfishing and runoff into the waters more nutrients in the water create more plankton and food for the jellies

7617363 if i dont play thursday when the patriots play the giants in their preseason finale then ill be ready for kansas city
7617364 im feeling very good im feeling very good i was wishing i could play last week and it didnt happen it will be the same thing this week im hoping im out there and if im not im not im trying to get better as fast as i can and in the ways i know how its been making improvements there is no doubt about it
7617365 i dont know whats going to happen i would assume that hell probably say no and if thats the case so be it ill get some practice today and tomorrow well be ok
7617366 i dont know if three or six plays although i would like to do that i dont know what you get out of that really
7617367 ive never really thought about injuries and im not saying osi did think about it but i saw the tape
7617368 that was meant to be i mean its very unfortunate for him and for the giants but it wasnt like guys rolled up on him that probably wouldve happened in practice at some point the way it occurred he just went down injuries are part of it they come in a lot of different ways
7617369 ive played so many games and not that i havent been injured but ive overcome injuries been lucky in a lot of situations
7617370 this is 18 years whatevers going to happen is going to happen i cant control that i love to play and thats really all i can think about
7617371 im going to see what it looks like over the two days and then evaluate it i cant say definitively no or definitively yes
7617372 i do understand his side of it i really do he has the whole team to think of
7617373 well i guess no more of a concern than coming in later and having a week to prepare for my first game like i did two weeks ago
7617374 to me that was a real game based on the circumstances at least in this case i will have had some practice and have worked with these guys not that that makes it any better but i feel more comfortable in that situation now than i did several weeks ago
7617375 yesterday morning i woke up and i said ok not too bad by yesterday afternoon i was like ohh usually two days after is when i feel the worst ive noticed that the last few years today will be a little tougher when you go out to practice than maybe in previous years it was good to not that i like getting hit but it was good to kind of get that over and done with
7617376 if i was a giant id do whatever i could to get him out and have him back on my team
7617377 the guy still looks great hell of a player i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7617378 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7617379 its weird how things work coming right into the season and having two of the three guys battling different ailments
7617380 but we still have a couple weeks before we really need to go
7617381 its a unique situation we have here we have three guys three young guys that are battling for a position that will determine how far we will go in this season
7617382 all three of them are still in the bag right now and i guess after this game well empty the bag and see who is the starting quarterback
7617383 we need to look at troy i dont think thats changed from last week
7617384 kyle is still viable in the mix hes had really good practices all through training camp wed like to play him also in the game
7617385 i dont know what theyre thinking all i know is i have to prepare myself as a starter go out there every day in practice and try to get better
7617386 i think hes in the mix because we have two quarterbacks that arent able to practice today so joes going to take all the reps
7617387 but the big picture hasnt changed dramatically in the sense that hes still a rookie and weve got two guys that were ahead of him before we came into this situation right before the st louis game
7617388 you take the situation as it is and you attack it every single day
7617389 we have a chance to get peyton activated and out to practice so well see how that goes
7617390 i think well ease him in and see how he practices and what hes able to do
7617391 its about want to youve got guys like brandon siler tim dobbins all three of us are trying to beat kassim down there to make a play before him it becomes a game within a game
7617392 people get in there see the competition and get into it
7617393 there are so many big plays we made on special teams in 2007 so many hidden yards on special teams that contribute to playing good defense and playing good offense
7617394 so it will be a big part of our decisions
7617395 because of that there is quite a bit of concern about how everyone else plays we have a standard here were trying to keep up they understand what that standard is and they dont want to lose that
7617396 its taken a few years of experiencing that you start with one or two or three then youve got five or six and then youve got seven or eight and theyre on the same wavelength
7617397 the way it is now with games being so close
7617398 more often than not its going to be a special teams play that makes the difference
7617399 growing up i always wanted to an icon part of that is being iconic
7617400 if he bowls a bad ball you need to punish him
7617401 only then will pressure build on him until now he wasnt under pressure so he has bowling at his best
7617402 the way we are batting its tough to sacrifice the extra batsman for the luxury of a fifth specialist bowler
7617403 guys do tend to have hiccups for one or two games but these are quality players who are eager to get back into form its a question of playing out the early overs which we have not managed
7617404 work with all of us for the rapid social and economic development of assam

7617406 our government has been reviewing the implementation of the assam accord and is committed to ensuring its implementation in letter and in spirit
7617407 in the last four and a half years of our government our effort has been to ensure that assam and the northeastern region claim their rightful place in sharing the fruits of national development we have changed the national policy in many sectors to respond to the specific requirements of assam and the northeast region

7617434 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7617435 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7617436 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7617437 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7617438 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7617439 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
7617440 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
7617441 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
7617442 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
7617443 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
7617444 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

7617504 the intrusion into the servers was quickly discovered and the servers were taken offline
7617505 detected an intrusion of certain of its computer systems and has issued a communication to red hat enterprise linux users
7617506 while the investigation into the intrusion is on going our initial focus was to review and test the distribution channel we use with our customers red hat network rhn and its associated security measures based on these efforts we remain highly confident that our systems and processes prevented the intrusion from compromising rhn or the content distributed via rhn and accordingly believe that customers who keep their systems updated using red hat network are not at risk we are issuing this alert primarily for those who may obtain red hat binary packages via channels other than those of official red hat subscribers
7617507 intruder was able to sign a small number of openssh packages relating only to red hat enterprise linux 4 i386 and x86 64 architectures only and red hat enterprise linux 5 x86 64 architecture only

7617511 even without health care reform the demand for family physicians is expected to surge by 2020 when the nation will need 140 000 family physicians according to the american academy of family physicians 2006 physician workforce report thats a 40 increase over the 100 000 family doctors at work in 2006
7617512 low payments to primary care doctors are discouraging those of us in practice and are dissuading new doctors from entering the field just nationalizing health insurance by declaring medicare for all isnt going to get the job done medical insurance coverage without a doctor to see is another big health problem not a solution
7617513 until we adequately fund primary care were not going to get the health system americans expect right now the u s is graduating about half the family physicians well need in the coming years and the government proposes to cut funding to train more the 2009 federal budget would abolish funding for training programs under title vii of the public health service act including section 747 of the act which provides the only federal grants for training primary care physicians to fill the primary care gap we could flood the u s with foreign trained doctors in fact were pretty much already doing that in our training programs fifty six percent of doctors starting family medicine residencies this summer are foreign graduates foreign grads practice mainly in larger cities so that doesnt help overall distribution of doctors to smaller communities

7617518 facebook took the unfortunate decision to restrict most users from accessing scrabulous on august 22 in response to a take down notice from mattel on august 14
7617519 the high court had reserved judgement in this matter after hearing both parties it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous without waiting for the high courts decision
7617520 it is even more astonishing that facebook which claims to be fair and neutral party took the step even though they were fully aware of the circumstances under which the mattel letter was sent

7617547 for so many people with such a strong allegiance to this park it has been a long arduous and costly struggle to restore delaware canal after hurricane ivan in 2004 and ensuing floods delivered successive knock out punches to its 60 mile long waterway and towpath
7617548 conditions so far this summer have proved to be a boon to large scale construction efforts that are dependent on favorable weather
7617549 we have some sections of both the canal and the towpath that were completely washed away
7617550 weather has been favorable for this work as crews are installing a new stabilized turf on the towpath which requires seeding weve had just enough rain to enable contractors to get the seed down and sustain its growth

7617580 i will be telling my delegates that i will vote for barack obama
7617581 how they vote is a more personal decision they want to have their chance to vote for me that is what traditionally happens some people are having to make up their minds because there are arguments pulling them both ways
7617582 every one of us could stand up and recite all the reasons why we must elect barack
7617583 none of that will happen if john mccain is in the white house i just want to make it absolutely clear we cannot afford four more years of george w bushs failed policies in america and thats what we would get with john mccain
7617584 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7617585 so let there be the no mistake about it we are united we are united for change
7617586 i want everyone to know that though i asked for 600 million in cuts speaker silver along with his staff brought up 850 million in cuts that could have taken us further than we were and the only thing that stood between us and those reductions was the new york state senate
7617587 at this time the governor would do well to heed the advice of one of the leading voices of his party over the last generation the late new york senator daniel patrick moynihan who famously observed everyone is entitled to his own opinion but not his own facts
7617588 the facts are these the assembly had no list of real spending reductions that would have allowed us to achieve additional savings and further strengthen the states finances if they do have such a list the governor should make it public immediately
7617589 the values that have driven him as a father husband and public servant and why she believes he will be an extraordinary president
7617590 modest means but big dreams and encouragement from loving parents that she and her brother could accomplish whatever they put their minds to if they worked hard like barack michelle was also taught to give back to the community and the country that has given her so much now as a working mother of two young girls michelle is continuing to give back to the community and country she loves
7617591 malia 10 and sasha 7 provided comic relief as they played on the stage and posed for pictures
7617592 the only way to beat senators is to beat them in their own districts
7617593 i think that the senate can change hands this year because of some very effective candidates that they have but if senator obama wins new york by 5 points or by 20 points it will not necessarily change the roles in the senate
7617594 each group is anxious that they may never see this opportunity come before them in their lifetime
7617595 im more optimistic i think we have turned the corner thanks to the campaigns of both of these individuals

7617649 barack obama has voted in support of higher taxes 94 times in just three years
7617650 any and all charges that obama would raise tax rates on capital gains dividends income savings and so on for the approximately 98 percent of american families making less than 250 000 are simply not true
7617651 if we kept the payroll tax exactly the same but applied it to all earnings and not just the first 102 000 we could virtually eliminate the entire social security shortfall
7617652 mr obama has repeatedly shifted his position on taxes to support his political situation
7617653 in iowa he was going to fix social security by eliminating the payroll cap now it is a 2 to 4 percent tax above 250 000 10 years from now i have no doubt after the election he would revert to his 2007 position on social security
7617654 when mr obamas full package of upper income tax increases goes into effect the top marginal tax rate would be nearly 50 percent a incentive destroying level we havent seen since 1986
7617655 what the mccain campaign doesnt tell you is that according to the tax policy center middle class families will get at least a three times larger tax cut under the obama plan than under senator mccains
7617656 if you had allen with you at a meeting you had instant credibility
7617657 i havent been particularly active in the last 10 or 15 years
7617658 in america we confidently believe were in a recession and we wonder how long do you have to wait to come out of it almost all of the executives of the present era dont have any idea what a real depression is like
7617659 ive worried a great deal about the increase in the government debt the war in the middle east is costing a lot of money but its not the only real expense we have medicare is costing an awful lot of money and i dont think any of us really knows exactly how much debt our government can stand
7617660 how do we as private citizens analyze and think through a balance sheet of the u s government
7617661 while im optimistic about the future ive wondered many times about the quality of leadership that our country has now or will have
7617662 i have a hard time envisioning just how some of these necessary changes are going to work
7617663 i want to be engrossed day in and day out in the care of the poor
7617664 they all want to volunteer and help other people they want to go where the earthquake is
7617665 he was interested in getting doctors to do this as a career as opposed to a hobby
7617666 typically doctors will go on their vacation and do some work its a great thing but its not sustainable
7617667 we think of things like the impact of mass incarceration this has enormous ramifications for the community as a whole
7617668 miami is a great place to do this type of work i definitely wouldnt have had this experience if id done it anywhere else
7617669 you see everything you see patients with tb patients with advanced hiv patients with chronic diseases like diabetes who just dont have access to basic care every time i see one of these patients it gives me more and more inspiration to fight for a healthcare system where we can give people the basics
7617670 if our middle class prospers our state and nation are stronger
7617671 the bush economic polices have given enormous breaks to the superwealthy and big corporations and they have been disastrous for maine

7617701 minor has failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that he is not likely to pose a danger to the community if released
7617702 ignoring the committees decision is only one in a growing list of ways the white house and its allies have politicized judicial selection
7617703 he did everything for her he created her career he handpicked her to go to the texas supreme court when he was trying to take over the texas supreme court
7617704 he was looking for people to groom and raise money for and have in his pipeline rove went and plucked her out of obscurity she was an unknown lawyer in houston
7617705 rove signed on giving the candidate the seal of approval from the states corporate establishment
7617706 he did everything he needed to to promote her hes the guy who brought her name up to bush for the federal appointment
7617707 is the latest reward of a partnership that began a dozen years ago when a prominent texas conservative introduced her to karl rove who was at the time a political consultant and emerging kingmaker
7617708 a judge should avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities
7617709 i am writing to you because you are the only people who can help me prove that the bush justice departments prosecution of me and justice oliver diaz jr and judges wes teel and john whitfield was politically motivated
7617710 over the past few months it has become increasingly clear that karl rove political strategist for bush and other republicans conceived a strategy to dry up political money to democratic candidates which included using the justice department as an instrument to prosecute prominent democrats particularly trial lawyers
7617711 allegations of selective prosecution in our federal criminal justice system
7617712 for testimony about the politicization of the department of justice
7617713 that such a hearing would also end with an evidentiary confrontation against the white house itself
7617714 the appearance of impropriety even if none exists is as bad as actual impropriety
7617715 if clear wrongdoing by mr rove can be established then it would be time to take a closer look at those political ties
7617716 as more becomes clear about the strength of the relationship or roves involvement in wrongdoing then there is cause perhaps to revisit
7617717 i do think that the nature of the case comes into play and i do think extra care is warranted when the case is already under close public scrutiny
7617718 owen can sit on the appeal and a bail application unless roves conduct is an issue in either decision
7617719 for that to happen someone in the case would have to inject it most likely the defendant otherwise roves relationship to the case is just background noise so far as the law is concerned
7617720 courts sometimes say the perception of justice is as important as justice however the fact that owen has ties to rove owes her job to him perhaps is not sufficient to create a disqualifying perception if nothing rove did or did not do ever arises in the case as a subject for the court to address

7617730 we dont have the foot soldiers or the strength to really offset the tide
7617731 u s recession and recovery u v or w shaped
7617732 theres been debate about whether its v shaped or u shaped
7617733 trying to make a desperate situation look sort of technical its not that much of a fuss the big boys can take care of it dont you worry

7617743 cullen harper is probably as fine a quarterback as their is in the country
7617744 and will certainly be drafted very high in the nfl draft next year maybe the first quarterback taken in the draft
7617745 the whole synergy of the team seems to center around those guys spiller and davis making great plays
7617746 if we stop the run in this game this is going to give us the best chance to be successful
7617747 julio did an outstanding job coming in here in camp
7617748 he worked hard in the summer he was in good shape
7617749 he and rolando give us two really good inside backers
7617750 not meaning to make any comparisons he is the type of young player that seems to be able to come in and get it learn it take it to the field he is a great competitor and it really bothers him when he doesnt do things well
7617751 balance means when at the end of the day and you sit down you had 250 yards rushing and you had 250 yards passing and that probably creates the biggest problem for the defense
7617752 now somedays it may work that way and some days it may not based on how the other team plays teams that play a lot of 8 man fronts probably are going to force you to throw the ball more in the game and people who play more split safety type coverages are probably going to create a balance where you are probalby goign to try to take advantage of running it more
7617753 when i was at michigan state and i went to lsu very few people knew a lot about the big ten and had seen very few michigan state games because we would probably play notre dame on tv every year and maybe one more game that was a national tv game
7617754 at lsu we would play seven to ten every year and the people in michigan who were my friends would see us play eight or nine games per year thats a fact

7617758 the demand has kind of grown on us as weve used every available space we have for the wellness programming
7617759 were using today some of our auditorium space for exercise programs in the morning because it is the only space we have that is large enough for people to stretch out and spread out and exercise
7617760 the people that come in we think generally will be more active and perhaps in better health than we were
7617761 in some regards the challenge to get more older adults active continues and of course its a problem for people of any age

7617766 i think its going to be a difficult match even if were going into it with a good result from the first leg we feel everything will work out well but it certainly wont be easy to beat wis a
7617767 its been a very positive time in terms of results and things have gone as we would have wished

7617864 it operations professionals need to prepare for a more decisive shift in their desktop operating system os strategy why now because microsoft released windows vista to the general public more than 18 months ago which is typically how long it departments need to test their applications and hardware against any new os forresters month on month study of more than 50 000 of our clients os preferences confirmed that users are on track with enterprises initial windows vista deployment plans
7617865 it operations folks are at a critical inflection point and should deploy windows vista to 1 stay current with microsofts and independent software vendors isvs support life cycles 2 help minimize todays security management and productivity challenges and 3 better position your business to eventually embrace windows 7 because windows vista investments will ultimately pay off with better compatibility for this next release

7617884 after that tourney i probably would have thought i would have more by now
7617885 all of a sudden youre like seven or eight rows back and theres a really tall guy in front of you waving his hands and screaming
7617886 not going to be as good as the other show
7617887 andy is playing at a time when maybe the greatest player to ever play roger federer is winning everything
7617888 and also the greatest clay court player to ever play rafa nadal is also doing his thing on the dirt and now even on grass and hard were it not for those two andy would have many more grand slams now
7617889 its a weird situation because by no means am i going to complain about anything that ive been blessed with but its almost at this point win another slam or what
7617890 i dont think you can put andy into that category
7617891 thats one thing that really drew me to him was the way he went about his work ethic
7617892 i could probably coast and not train and be a top 10 player and kind of have a cushy lifestyle and be set for as long as i need to be set for
7617893 im happy as i can be away from tennis matches but i dont know if that appeals to me i dont know if im satisfied with that
7617894 its like you want something so bad you almost squeeze too tight
7617895 a lot of guys in todays times look at their success by their bank balance
7617896 andy never did that he wanted his success on the court winning was what he wanted to do more than anything and i can see what he says sometimes hes wound too tight
7617897 andy had success early with big serve and big forehand
7617898 thats great if you have that 1 2 combo but now how many guys have big serves and backhands everybody knows that andys weakness is his backhand i think andy has gotten a little too conservative off the ground
7617899 after the french open people started understanding my game better
7617900 i was a defensive player when i came on tour i was forced to become stronger i was forced to develop an attacking game you can only thread the needle on a passing shot or hit a lob so much
7617901 his dilemma is that he wants to win the semis and finals of big tournaments and he needs more aspects in his game to beat the top players in tough matches
7617902 he has all the tools theres no doubt about that
7617903 to trust the tools that he has and to go out and be willing to put that into the actual match play time after time after time i think thats really the only thing he has to do
7617904 he was playing awfully well in that february may stretch
7617905 unfortunately the injury with my neck had thrown a bit of a wrench into the summer
7617906 its really the first time in my career i have had to deal with any injuries for an extended period of time but i feel like if i can get deep into a tourney i can regain the form from earlier in the year pretty quickly

7617939 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7617940 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7617941 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7617942 until we have a deal we dont have a deal

7617945 a prominent pennsylvania democrat has sued sen barack obama the democratic national committee and the federal election commission claiming that obama is not a natural born citizen and therefore is not eligible to be president of the united states philip j berg a former member of pennsylvanias democratic state committee and former deputy attorney general of pennsylvania filed the lawsuit this week in u s district court asking the court to declare obama ineligible for the presidency and to prevent him from running for the position
7617946 the lawsuit claims barack obamas eligibility is questionable on several grounds including the allegation that he was born in kenya to parents unable to automatically grant him american citizenship that his hawaii birth certificate is a forgery a now discredited claim that he was made a citizen of indonesia as a child and that he retained foreign citizenship into adulthood without recording an oath of allegiance to regain any theoretical american citizenship
7617947 the berg lawsuit contends there is enough truth in the various reports to conclude
7617948 obamas grandmother on his fathers side half brother and half sister claim obama was born in kenya
7617949 reports reflect obamas mother went to kenya during her pregnancy however she was prevented from boarding a flight from kenya to hawaii at her late stage of pregnancy which apparently was a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight stanley ann dunham obama gave birth to obama in kenya after which she flew to hawaii and registered obamas birth

7617959 on the positive side theres so much more information available
7617960 but it becomes overwhelming especially for those unfamiliar with the tools to filter through it
7617961 why do you need 300 reports in your in box
7617962 for so long companies have preached the importance of multitasking
7617963 people fear a disruptive technology or business model will come on the scene and they wont have time to act
7617964 its becoming exponentially more difficult to tap into the collective consciousness and stay on top of changes in an industry or area of interest or even stay relevant in the workplace
7617965 i now am skimming and reading articles on dozens of news sites and technology journals clicking on sources linked to by a blogger and a whole lot more

7617971 whereas the reporter asserted the recent compromise of data for past guests from as far back as 2007 best western purges all online reservations promptly upon guest departure
7617972 was this a case of over exuberant reporting or is best western trying to downplay the scale of the incident whats obvious is that at the moment the facts of this case are unclear even if only one hotel branch was affected there is still an important reminder here for every organization to take the utmost care over securing its customers data rival hotel firms would be wise not to bounce on their beds in glee at best westerns possible misfortune but look again at their own systems to make sure that they are properly defended

7617978 the one thing you wont find on the engineering windows 7 blog is major product announcements the focus is to simply the engineering of windows 7 not only can we expect posts from both steven and jon on the engineering windows 7 blog we can also expect to hear from other members of the engineering team who are essentially building the next version of windows as we speak

7617984 its growing a couple of years from now people arent going to recognize this place ive been here eight years and its changed immensely from then
7617985 we picked this area because it wasnt in the middle of everything
7617986 and its where my husband works we like having everything close in to the area
7617987 i want to have sympathy but there are 26 to 28 some of these kids are coming in and have never been to pre school before
7617988 we spent 400 thousand by the end of the year that was 150 grand we could have spent on staff
7617989 what we are trying to do is limit all activities to tulsa county if possible
7617990 if those organizations want to raise money well let them go
7617991 this added classroom and office space is necessary to meet the exponential enrollment growth we are experiencing the pawnee nation college now holds the capacity to serve 490 students each semester a monumental jump from when our doors opened in 2005
7617992 it is historical irony that these buildings were first built and used as a means to crush indian culture and now they are being used to celebrate and advance that same culture
7617993 few can imagine the amount of time and energy it took for the college to grow to this point but for the assistance of people who care like lucas keating and mcpeak and the wisdom of the pawnee nation tribal council we would not be where we are for many more years

7617995 a couple of his teammates in a fit of high spirits took a photo of him sitting on a toilet and in what they saw as a prank circulated this photo to other team members
7617996 this was inappropriate and foolhardy behaviour at the end of a long campaign for which the team members concerned have been suspended from the team
7617997 all three swimmers are very remorseful and have apologised to team management for what was poor judgement on their part and accept the punishment handed down
7617998 its something that both swimming new zealand and the nzoc will have to address its not something that can be ignored

7618000 we only have one rule in the olympic team that we respect one another
7618001 to have perfectly safe water we would have to put a cover over the whole lake
7618002 taupo was unusual for its size for having non compliant drinking water supply schemes the large influx of tourists over the summer exposed more people to drinking water supplied from non compliant schemes
7618003 the council as the water supplier must take all steps to protect the water source and provide an adequate supply and wholesome drinking water
7618004 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7618005 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow celebrities refuse to consider any attack off limits

7618009 i did a rap like im the person sitting at the computer typing and saying bad stuff about chamillionaire its some little kid thats on the internet hes young hes getting all this stuff hes saying about me his mother comes in and asks him did you take your medication are you on those porno sites again im rapping like im him in his voice
7618010 yeah there are no camels in tibet but if they want a camel ill get them a camel
7618011 he thinks hes as famous as jen now last week he went to a party tipped off the paps and even had decoy cars at the ready when he was leaving nice but no one bothered to follow them which made john think he lost everyone when really no one bothered to follow him
7618012 pictures of him and jen were selling for 20 000 at one point a picture of him alone gets 200 now chasing him from his apartment to nobu is hardly worth it
7618013 we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter
7618014 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation

7618016 a tip from a source close to microsofts marketing department
7618017 to push through legislation to remove antitrust exemptions for u s railroads
7618018 special antitrust exemptions that allow the nations freight railroads to avoid competition and therefore keep their rates artificially and unfairly high
7618019 imagine consolidations in the airline telecom or pharmaceutical industries without the department of justice or the federal trade commission ensuring consumers are protected through compliance with the nations antitrust laws thats exactly what happens in the railroad industry
7618020 as franchising became a more popular method of distributing goods and services at the same time antitrust law moved heavily toward permitting franchisors more flexibility in structuring and administrating their franchise programs
7618021 this 30 year retrospective suggests that the antitrust laws cannot be ignored by the franchise legal community but the in terrorem effect they once had on franchising has been mollified extensively
7618022 if this really happens in the real world women on the pill would end up choosing a more genetically similar mate than she would otherwise choose and the implications go on from there
7618023 my own research says the way a man smells to a woman is the main determinant of sexual attraction
7618024 if you cant stand how someone smells you cannot become intimate
7618025 a womans response to a mans natural body odor will be colored by her feelings for him
7618026 so if you fell in love with a man online it would be hard to be repelled by his smell
7618027 jeri id like to thank you for the warm welcome ive received as the newest member of this campaign what you and barack have accomplished over the past 19 months is incredible and its an honor to be part of it im looking forward to rolling up my sleeves and getting involved about how i hope to help in the weeks ahead

7618040 these abnormal features of tumor vessels impair delivery of circulating chemotherapeutic drugs to the actual tumor site
7618041 because high cell density increases contractility across the entire cell layer these findings suggested that tumor capillary cells are inherently hyper contractile
7618042 in this study weve uncovered a previously unrecognized role for tumor capillary cell mechanosensing and contractility in the formation of irregular tumor vessels and have identified potential new targets for vascular normalization therapy that might be implemented in the clinic someday
7618043 the research mission of the kelley school is central to our global reputation being an elite business school no longer means being the best among u s competitors it means competing with institutions around the world
7618044 kelleys focus on attracting the best researchers and students creates an environment that fosters research that advances theory and is highly relevant to business leaders
7618045 attracting and retaining top research scholars in todays highly competitive global market requires a significant financial commitment from the university as well as an environment that cultivates great ideas and great research that dual commitment is what makes the kelley school the no 1 public business school in research impact
7618046 for so many people with such a strong allegiance to this park it has been a long arduous and costly struggle to restore delaware canal after hurricane ivan in 2004 and ensuing floods delivered successive knock out punches to its 60 mile long waterway and towpath
7618047 conditions so far this summer have proved to be a boon to large scale construction efforts that are dependent on favorable weather
7618048 we have some sections of both the canal and the towpath that were completely washed away
7618049 weather has been favorable for this work as crews are installing a new stabilized turf on the towpath which requires seeding weve had just enough rain to enable contractors to get the seed down and sustain its growth
7618050 when contractors are working in the park it is their site their liability and their rules

7618078 when we started hca 40 years ago we set out to provide communities in the sun belt with access to better quality healthcare
7618079 my father jack massey henry hooker and i could have never conceived that hca would grow into a company whose caregivers perform about 5 of many healthcare procedures in the u s and that nashville would become a healthcare hub im so proud of the impact our caregivers and employees have had over all these years as weve focused on treating our patients
7618080 ive spent almost my entire career with hca because the principles tommy dr frist sr and our other founders believed in putting patients first and treating people with dignity are deeply ingrained in the bedrock of our companys culture
7618081 it is because our employees and caregivers live these values everyday that hca has prospered for 40 years

7618093 at the establishment of our constitutions the judiciary bodies were supposed to be the most helpless and harmless members of the government experience however soon showed in what way they were to become the most dangerous that the insufficiency of the means provided for their removal gave them a freehold and irresponsibility in office that their decisions seeming to concern individual suitors only pass silent and unheeded by the public at large that these decisions nevertheless become law by precedent sapping by little and little the foundations of the constitution and working its change by construction before any one has perceived that that invisible and helpless worm has been busily employed in consuming its substance in truth man is not made to be trusted for life if secured against all liability to account

7618098 if you choose your components correctly it turns out its possible to store as much as a few hours worth of energy at the side of the turbines how we do that i would leave as a secret for a little while but the notion is that in the end all of what were using are elements of technology already commonly found in alberta its not like weve discovered some new vanadium cell or some speculative thing its a case of using good engineering principles and novel integration
7618099 when you start looking at how much money you spend on the means of energy production versus how much money you spend on storage and how you allocate your capital ratios that interplay lets you effectively put most of the grid on renewable energy

7618102 we are filled with joy by the release of this group of prisoners but we will not be content until all prisoners are released the 11 000 who are still waiting
7618103 its not easy to release prisoners particularly individuals that were directly involved in terrorist attacks against innocent civilians
7618104 it is with great concern that we witness the deteriorating humanitarian situation in various parts of mindanao as a result of the recent upsurge in conflict
7618105 many civilians have lost their lives and many more are at risk
7618106 the agencies of the iasc who come together to coordinate relief efforts on behalf of the international community in times of crisis appeal for calm and protection of all civilians
7618107 they civilians are safe to go home now but we understand the trauma they are now suffering
7618108 our troops and police are trying their level best more than what is expected of them to end this as soon as possible but it would be dishonest of me to say it will be over soon
7618109 two and a half years ago lifeway worship director mike harland came into my office and talked about a plan and a vision of creating a new hymnal and a new worship project that would help churches craft their worship experiences i sensed that it was truly a god thing today we have reason to celebrate gods goodness with the dedication of this new hymnal
7618110 lets us remember the past observe the present and commit to the future
7618111 its been such an honor to be involved and our thanks to all whove worked on this whole project its our goal to write hymns with two purposes to honor god and to bring generations together through singing these songs of worship

7618116 at that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom
7618117 at midnight the cry rang out heres the bridegroom come out to meet him
7618118 then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps
7618119 no they replied there may not be enough for both us and you
7618120 but while they were on their way to buy the oil the bridegroom arrived
7618121 but he replied i tell you the truth i dont know you
7618122 therefore keep watch because you do not know the day or the hour matt 25 1 13
7618123 for i am jealous for you with a godly jealousy for i betrothed you to one husband so that to christ i might present you as a pure virgin
7618124 therefore keep watch because you do not know the day or the hour
7618125 again it will be like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted his property to them
7618126 after a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them
7618127 then the man who had received the one talent came
7618128 take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents
7618129 when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory
7618130 then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father take your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world
7618131 then the righteous will answer him lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink
7618132 the king will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me
7618133 then he will say to those on his left depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels
7618134 they also will answer lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and did not help you
7618135 he will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me
7618136 then they will go away to eternal punishment but the righteous to eternal life
7618137 and goes on to talk about the lord setting up his throne on earth after his return for the judgment of the nations actually a judgment of gentile tribulation survivors

7618141 the epas refusal to control pollution from oil refineries is the latest example of the bush administrations do nothing policy on global warming

7618145 plan to lower gasoline prices by increasing americas energy supplies promoting more conservation and efficiency and encouraging the use of more alternative and renewable fuels
7618146 approach they like to claim they support drilling and they like to claim they support natural gas but their rhetoric doesnt match their actions or their voting record over the weekend speaker pelosi made quite a claim on nbcs

7618158 we had just let him out for the morning and he ran into the yard and started barking his head off
7618159 i specifically asked each member to read these not once but twice

7618167 we followed the process and feel like the ruling was the correct one
7618168 at the end of the week the convention will be unified
7618169 the country wants a democratic president they are just not sure about this democrat
7618170 a lot of people still dont know much about him
7618171 its not all silly hats its also about meaningful policy
7618172 sen obama is the best opportunity to change whats happening in d c
7618173 i think hillary has clearly sent the signal lets move on
7618174 hes got to engender trust and make a connection with people
7618175 they have to convince the country it wants this democrat
7618176 major fighting came to an end on friday evening and by saturday they islamic insurgents were in control of kismayo
7618177 our estimate is that some 6220 families about 37 320 people have been displaced since the fighting began on friday
7618178 those who have gone west are facing serious water problems since the area is suffering from drought and is not close to the river
7618179 our figures show that 102 people have died and close to 250 injured these are the ones whose bodies were found or made to the hospital
7618180 they are peacefully disarming hundreds of freelance militiamen in the city that have been causing serious security problems
7618181 businesses have reopened and transport vehicles are back on the streets
7618182 the fighting was to control the port for resource generation and not as portrayed in some places a political or other issue
7618183 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7618184 however we will play a constructive role in light of the charter of democracy and continuous struggle for restoration of judges and genuine democracy in pakistan
7618185 it basically means a realignment within the pakistani political spectrum
7618186 pakistani politics have been dominated by the military for the past nine years since ex president musharraf took over in a bloodless coup in 1999 after his resignation the sense is that the military is not going to stage another coup anytime soon given that the current head of the pakistani military has indicated that the military will keep out of politics
7618187 there are many reasons for sharifs pullout the obvious reason is of course the judges issue sharif and zardari agreed to restore the judges that pervez musharraf fired last year on november 3 when he declared an emergency in the country
7618188 but the other reasons are that there are larger ideological differences and political differences one other reason which many people are still speculating about is the war on terror the two do not agree on how to pursue the war on terror
7618189 there are divisions of the georgian army and police in villages in the border leningorsk region we do not know the total amount of men there at present
7618190 we have to see what kind of amendments come then only we can decide but we cannot accept prescriptive conditionalities
7618191 we met a lot of individual delegates of nsg member countries and had an opportunity to brief them on thursday
7618192 is a necessary step for cooperation between india and the nsg we look forward to working with them
7618193 our american partners have brought non food items to georgia
7618194 first of all it is a sign meaning that georgia is not alone that georgia will not be let alone in times of hardship
7618195 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the cease fire agreement
7618196 the railway is vital not just for the georgian economy but for the economy of neighboring countries
7618197 unfortunately a lot of surprises of this nature are still in front of us
7618198 im finishing up a record with brian eno a musician that i worked with 30 years ago
7618199 we did a record together of songs and thatll come out
7618200 for the first time in 20 years brian had written a lot of music but needed some words which i know how to do whats it sound like electronic gospel thats all im saying
7618201 while i enjoyed worked on educational and environmental issues in the state i really feel most of the issues we face are national in scope and its at the national level that well fail or succeed as a country
7618202 it shows how far weve come that an openly gay candidate can win in a suburban district in colorado
7618203 this election cycle has definitely put a few chinks in the glass ceiling in our congressional district we showed that sexual orientation is not seen by voters as a bar to public service
7618204 if a man wants to get a gut he does it the old fashioned way beer and nachos

7618217 celle offers women the unique opportunity to bring the focus back on themselves in a way that is lasting and long term without being time consuming or invasive
7618218 we live in a society where women do not have a lot of time to spare on doing something healthful for themselves and unfortunately this can negatively impact the way a woman handles her health today and in the future celle gives women the tools necessary to do something proactive that may affect her and possibly her family in the long run

7618238 it has been a tough day i had to make a very difficult decision something very positive has come up late in my career and i cannot turn it down
7618239 its just that things happened fast and i had to go anyone else in my position would not have said no to such a deal
7618240 social networking connect and youre done no seriously theres nothing else you can do
7618241 i started the company with a 1 000 budget from my dorm room in boca raton fl today the owners of more than 1 3 million websites depend on our hosting service we are extremely proud of our strong past growth but were really only getting started
7618242 if it wasnt for the internet and computers we wouldnt be in business if just one of the kids can further their knowledge in computers and make a career out of it in some shape or form it will have been worth every penny
7618243 in their zeal to privatize government functions and turn over operations to various out of state corporations like ibm and acs the defendants have trampled upon common sense they have disregarded the needs of the aged the infirm and the disabled and they are violating federal and state law and regulations in the process
7618244 one in six hoosiers depend on food stamps and medicaid this is a highly vulnerable population who need and deserve accessible local offices that are properly staffed with experienced caseworkers who can provide face to face contact
7618245 u s food and nutrition service fns has so many concerns about indianas welfare privatization it told the state in a june 23 rd letter it wanted a halt in the rollout until a corrective action plan was in place the defendants claim they have put things on hold to fix what they call bugs in the system yet our evidence is that despite the directives from fns caseworkers are being removed from local offices in northwest indiana and the transition to privatization continues the only thing that mitch daniels and mitch roob will respect is a court order and we aim to get that for them
7618246 our clients are doing this not just for themselves but for tens of thousands of other young elderly and disabled residents in fssas 13 county region 3 which includes laporte st joseph lake and other northwestern indiana counties who depend on face to face contact with caseworkers to determine eligibility for benefits if the administration wants to provide computers and call centers as another entry point or option to check on benefits thats great but you dont replace highly skilled local caseworkers who do eligibility with somebody working for a private vendor in a call center
7618247 thousands of recipients needing their prescription drugs and food stamps are being bumped off the rolls for no good reason
7618248 not saved taxpayers one thin dime in the two fiscal years since its inception it actually cost taxpayer dollars to move to this new system so that a few out of state corporations could make money on the backs of our poor our disabled kids and our elderly thats unacceptable and we plan to make our case to the court as to why an injunction should immediately issue that would block privatization from being rolled out in northwest indiana
7618249 you cant take a picture of this its already gone
7618250 it was a huge thing growing up being able to have a perspective on the social hierarchy of high school mainly because youre not a part of it
7618251 the key in high school is to fit into a clique and i never did
7618252 thats what we heard in our young and na ve brains

7618260 i cant say whether their intention was to intimidate but if they can do this to an influential writer who has done nothing more than take photographs then one can only imagine the kind of threat that ordinary people in tibet must feel every day

7618268 yes however they could not locate my original purchase sd870 black but this one is the same but the only difference is the color rim around the lens this one is silver and the one you brought was black
7618269 yes so if you want to get this one ill have someone do a return and and charge it all over again
7618270 fine ok if i dont want it ill return it later
7618271 somehow in the system that same model but with the different color rim apparently will cost me 50 more

7618275 it hasnt gone unanswered in fact id say its been loudly answered
7618276 i dont think theres any question that russias reputation has suffered since it took these disproportionate military steps in georgia
7618277 theres no question that russia hasnt lived up to the cease fire agreement
7618278 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7618279 it could be that the safety benefits of driving slower are proportionately greater than the fuel economy benefits
7618280 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7618281 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip

7618304 i dont want to go there again not even for a holiday in goa i prefer dubai and may even buy a flat there yes i like indian food and enjoy bollywood films and want my daughters to marry an indian just like any other father of any other community here
7618305 indianness is eroding can i wear the sari to work here not very practical i wear saris a few times a year do i cook indian food every day its not possible as it takes so long when i have little time after work do we celebrate all our festivals no except the big ones so my children have become more british than indian
7618306 it was not an ideal working situation in my opinion from the players standpoint just the uncertainty that was hovering the fact that we all came in new what had gone on in previous years before we got here there was so much swirling around it was very uncomfortable

7618308 the best thing thats ever happened to our basketball franchise and basketball team
7618309 my name is michael weiss malik and i work for google
7618310 you know beloved as the whole world knows how much i have lost in you how at one wretched stroke of fortune that supreme act of flagrant treachery robbed me of my very self in robbing me of you and how my sorrow for my loss is nothing compared with what i feel for the manner in which i lost you
7618311 her uncles love for her was equaled only by his desire that she should have the best education which he could possibly procure for her of no mean beauty she stood out above all by reason of her abundant knowledge of letters
7618312 oh how great was the uncles grief when he learned the truth and how bitter was the sorrow of the lovers when we were forced to part
7618313 she however most violently disapproved of this and for two chief reasons the danger thereof and the disgrace which it would bring upon me what penalties she said would the world rightly demand of her if she should rob it of so shining a light
7618314 then there is no more left but this that in our doom the sorrow yet to come shall be no less than the love we two have already known
7618315 nor in this as now the whole world knows did she lack the spirit of prophecy
7618316 often the hearts of men and women are stirred as likewise they are soothed in their sorrows more by example than by words and therefore am i now minded to write of the sufferings which have sprung out of my misfortunes
7618317 while i am denied your presence give me at least through your words of which you have enough and to spare some sweet sem blance of yourself
7618318 i beg you think what you owe me give ear to my pleas and i will finish a long letter with a brief ending farewell my only love
7618319 if since our conversion from the world to god i have not yet written you any word of comfort or advice it must not be attributed to indifference on my part but to your own good sense i did not think you would need these things
7618320 but if i lose you what have i left to hope for why continue on lifes pilgrimage for which i have no support but you and none in you save the knowledge that you are alive now that i am forbidden all other pleasures in you and denied even the joy of your presence which from time to time could restore me to myself

7618338 yesterday there was nothing then this morning it suddenly appeared like this
7618339 olympics this and olympics that in the end would it allow people to live or not
7618340 why cant i send it i am just sending a small present
7618341 i originally thought that the olympics would bring us common people some good luck but i never expected it would be like this if the situation continues it will be impossible for us to do anything it seems that during the olympics i can only stay home and watch the olympics
7618342 now it is the special period of the olympics you must be very cautious and should not go out as you please in the event that any incidents happen then the patrolling group will exaggeratedly label you as somebody who attempts to sabotage the stability of the society during the olympics then you will bite off more than you can chew
7618343 we heard that the monks in the monasteries are very strong and they are very good at fighting is that so
7618344 we are providing assistance to those outsiders who are employed to fight the war and their objects of war are monks we respect the most and our compatriots what are we doing
7618345 do not do this why bother to do these things it must hurt a lot the three jewels bless these poor children
7618346 the government has taken great pains in preparing for it for a long time and they must want the olympics to go smoothly what are those people who sabotage it doing the government is trying so hard they should help the government to achieve their goal if they want to stir up trouble they can do so later the government is rather pitiful
7618347 we should think how long ago the earthquake just ended they must be without any conscience otherwise how can they make those exaggerated and arrogant actions these chengdu people are indeed exaggerated and doing things without taking the situation into consideration

7618350 this is an effort on our part to tie the three events together the world trade center the pentagon and shanksville
7618351 i couldnt have dreamed this would turn out any better all the brotherhood coming down from new york and new jersey and showing up here today to pay their respect to this piece of steel

7618357 two more nato ships passed through the strait and entered the black sea on friday evening
7618358 the situation in the black sea is escalating nato is continuing to build up its naval presence in the area
7618359 the black sea fleet continues to carry out its task of maritime traffic security patrols off the coast of abkhazia
7618360 the availability is an excellent time to take care of the equipment that took care of us during deployment
7618361 this is the first sra for me its hard to recognize the spaces with so much boarded up
7618362 with all the grinding and construction it makes me appreciate the ear plugs given to me
7618363 the maintenance team has worked hard to develop a work package that uses available funding to address the maintenance that will ensure ingraham remains ready for tasking for many years to come
7618364 the overriding goal of the contractors the navys maintenance organization and ships force is for ingraham to complete sra at a higher state of readiness than when she entered
7618365 participating governments exchanged views in a constructive manner and agreed to meet again in the near future to continue their deliberations the group said in a statement on its web site
7618366 this report underscores what i think we have known for a very long time that there is no place else in the country for a more dynamic mutually supportive civilian military relationship than what we all enjoy here in san diego
7618367 more naval forces are coming to san diego to take advantage of the many benefits here including the uss carl vinson cvn 70 in 2010 the mine and countermeasure forces and the first of the navys littoral combat ships
7618368 it is strategically important to our national security with its deep water port and access to area training ranges the san diego area is home to the largest concentration of military in the world
7618369 for over 100 years the navy and the san diego community have worked together for a mutual benefit this report bears testimony to the close relationship one we can look forward to nurturing and maintaining in perpetuity
7618370 one of them is territorial integrity we are here at the security council as i said yesterday georgia has a history at the security council and all previous resolutions of the security council on georgia have reaffirmed the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty territorial integrity and independence of georgia
7618371 the second element which is crucial is addressing the text in a way conducive to consensus the modalities whereby russian forces would remain after the withdrawal and pending the establishment of an international mechanism
7618372 some were asking in consultation today why there is no reference to territorial integrity on our draft resolution our draft resolution again is the repetition a reconfirmation of the six principles
7618373 and you know what there is no territorial integrity in the six principles so if we stick to the six principles which were adopted by the two presidents there is not supposed to be any reference in the resolution to territorial integrity
7618374 the fact is that what we see now on the ground is a reflection of the ambiguities that could be helped immensely by the clarifications that have already been expressed by president sarkozy
7618375 the french draft resolution doesnt address those the draft again doesnt address anything about territorial integrity neither do the six points but that doesnt mean that the european union which has articulated its position in a communique somehow doesnt agree with the territorial integrity of georgia and the need to reaffirm it
7618376 a large part of the russian forces have left they have withdrawn from the base in senaki and some have left poti but they have set up what they call two peacekeeping checkpoints in the city
7618377 one you can see behind me near the bridge the second one is in the city in the nabada district where we have a free industrial economic zone
7618378 the road to the final liberation of georgia will be very difficult and filled with obstacles
7618379 it is absolutely clear that until the occupational forces are replaced by a contingent of international observers it will be impossible to think about georgias complete freedom and impossible to speak about the resolution of the conflict and the liberation of the entire territory of georgia
7618380 the state of emergency has been prolonged until september 8 because russia has not fulfilled all six points of the cease fire agreement which was brokered by france and the european union
7618381 our main task now is to get those villagers who were under our jurisdiction before back to their villages
7618382 we need to get the people back and rebuild everything the russian forces destroyed
7618383 noted that russian forces had begun a process of withdrawal and that this should continue and finish in accordance with commitments made by the russian side
7618384 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato
7618385 this is what is going to happen now georgia is going to accelerate its march toward nato and i hope to an action plan in december
7618386 they deployed to the most challenging parts of the world and not only developed as a team they exemplified the word teamwork throughout their deployment we are grateful to their families and friends for waiting as they did our nations work
7618387 being back is an unbelievable feeling i am very proud of the crew and all they have accomplished during these last six months
7618388 their ability to successfully deploy and execute required tasking was a direct reflection of their high state of readiness and extensive training
7618389 the russian side has fulfilled the agreements set out in the medvedev sarkozy plan drawn up in moscow
7618390 the units withdrawal took place without upsets and was concluded according to plan at 19 50 moscow time 15 50 gmt
7618391 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7618392 an international discussion of lasting security and stability arrangements for south ossetia and abkhazia
7618393 not a single russian soldier or piece of military hardware remains in gori
7618394 from the direction of gori three armored vehicles are moving in our direction plus two trucks loaded with personnel and they passed us and went in the direction of igoeti i asked one of the russian officers at the checkpoint who was wearing a peacekeeping armband and he said they dont intend to stay for long when i asked him to be more concrete he said we are waiting for orders i cant tell you anything my boss is general borisov
7618395 yesterday august 21 general borisov had a fairly heated discussion with gori regional governor vladimer vardzelashvili about the so called buffer zone
7618396 borisov had all kinds of maps out and was referring to the 1992 cease fire agreement which stipulates that the conflict zone included quite a lot of villages north of gori in gori district including two villages that are located along the main east west highway shavshvebi and agara so if we go with that agreement it would mean that the so called peacekeepers who would replace the regular russian troops will have the right to control the main highway and even establish checkpoints
7618397 the idea is by tomorrow night august 22 all those forces will move to within that perimeter the peacekeeping perimeter
7618398 i have to say from witnessing all the discussions going on about the issue i have the feeling that neither side has a good understanding of how to proceed
7618399 for instance yesterday when vardzelashvili tried to make the argument that the main highway of a sovereign country cannot be controlled by troops from another country borisov tried to calm him down by saying the troops wont actually stand on the highway or hinder traffic that theyd just stand off to the side i managed somehow to have a look at the maps and its clearly marked at shavshvebi and agara that the buffer zone crosses the highway so this is what they have on their maps
7618400 we believe the six principles are clear and already implemented
7618401 some were asking in consultation today why there is no reference to territorial integrity on our draft resolution our draft resolution again is a repetition a reconfirmation of the six principles
7618402 and you know what there is no territorial integrity in the six principles so if we stick to the six principles which were adopted by the two presidents there is not supposed to be any reference in the resolution to territorial integrity
7618403 doesnt mean that the eu which has articulated its position in a communique somehow doesnt agree with the territorial integrity of georgia and the need to reaffirm it
7618404 we still believe that an agreement can be reached by the end of the year
7618405 but theres no attempt on the part of the u s government to push the parties beyond where they believe they can go the important thing here is that both sides have committed to trying to reach an agreement its in the best interest of both peoples its in the best interests of the united states and the rest of the international community
7618406 defense minister anatoly serdyukov has reported to the commander in chief president dmitry medvedev on the completion of the order to pull out from georgian territory russian troops sent to reinforce peacekeepers
7618407 peacekeeping checkpoints in the security zone have started carrying out the tasks set before them
7618408 the fact of the pullout of occupying forces from the main towns under enormous pressure from the international community is a good start and a step in the right direction
7618409 but we should not be under any illusions as our road to freedom will be long
7618410 the russians want to have eight peacekeeping checkpoints outside south ossetia but that is not agreed with us or with the international mediators
7618411 it is not russias right to decide unilaterally how many checkpoints will be here it will be the subject of further negotiations
7618412 it is my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7618413 all the forces but those that were involved in the region before august 7 and secondly that their ability to patrol is limited to a small area
7618414 in short were going home peace to all countries what else can i say theres no need for war there should be friendship
7618415 were just doing our bit were following orders were leaving here now
7618416 the officer explained the situation this way at the roki tunnel 150 officers of the fsb russias federal security service are searching the columns of vehicles very thoroughly and it takes a lot of time
7618417 theyre doing this in order to make sure that the soldiers dont take any looted goods or weapons or maybe even money that dont belong to them so everyone is being checked and as the officer said that is why this process of withdrawal has dragged on for so long
7618418 in order to stop groups of looters and prevent the delivery of unaccounted for weapons and ammunition
7618419 18 peacekeeping surveillance posts have been set up along the administrative border between georgia and south ossetia
7618420 units of the georgian armed forces are concentrating in central georgia restoring their combat capability and preparing for further actions
7618421 georgian forces are carrying out reconnaissance into the character and direction of the actions of russian troops and south ossetian formations and are preparing military actions in the georgia south ossetia conflict zone
7618422 yesterday august 21 general borisov had a fairly heated discussion with gori regional governor vladimer vardzelashvili about the so called buffer zone borisov had all kinds of maps out and was referring to the 1992 cease fire agreement which stipulates that the conflict zone included quite a lot of villages north of gori in gori district including two villages that are located along the main east west highway shavshvebi and agara
7618423 so if we go with that interpretation it would mean that the so called peacekeepers who would replace the regular russian troops would have the right to control the main highway and even establish checkpoints
7618424 as far as i know senaki would not be in any buffer zone
7618425 senaki is about 40 kilometers away from the border with abkhazia there is i believe a 14 kilometer zone on either side of the administrative border between abkhazia and the rest of georgia the russians definitely have the right to patrol that area under the old agreements senaki is way away from there what the russians are saying is that it falls into the zone of responsibility of the peacekeepers i havent heard them refer to a specific document that gives them the right to stay in senaki or poti
7618426 there is going to be a huge need for western aid when the russians finally do ship out and it looks like it is going to come
7618427 if the aid comes fast if it is significant then i think president mikheil saakashvili may be able to turn around and say look this was always coming anyway
7618428 if he can say all those things then hes in a stronger position but a lot will depend on the speed and quantity of the aid

7618432 he has been a solid advocate for sensible gun laws that protect our police officers and our families i was proud to stand with him just weeks ago in philadelphia when he joined with our nations mayors in supporting tough crime fighting laws and also last year when police leaders urged passage of common sense measures to protect law enforcement officers our nation would be well served with joe biden as our vice president
7618433 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because they are either mentally imbalanced and or they have a criminal record

7618490 it is unthinkable that this measure would go on the ballot without voters knowing theyre choosing between a legalizing 400 percent interest rates for payday lenders permanently and b bringing them back under the 36 percent interest rate that already applies to other lenders in arizona
7618491 we have learned that legalizing loansharking in this state was a mistake and this is a chance for voters to put a stop to it if they know what theyre voting for
7618492 its a crucial point that voters must know when they vote in november
7618493 they should also know that an industry based out of state an industry whose revenues depend on trapping voters in 400 percent loans has spent nearly 9 million so far on a campaign to deceive voters on the matter of this interest rate and its only august
7618494 payday lenders will be legally allowed to operate in arizona after the interest rate exemption expires in 2010 as long as they keep their interest rates under 36 percent as other lenders already must do or they can close up shop if they cant survive on that the choice is theirs
7618495 the point is 400 percent interest rates must end voters should reject prop 200 and the secretary of state has a responsibility to let voters know exactly what that measure would do

7618515 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
7618516 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed
7618517 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded onto a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost the transfer of data on this assignment to the external contractor has been suspended
7618518 we are collaborating closely with the home office on this matter we have no further comment to make at this time
7618519 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
7618520 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
7618521 the motivation is to raise awareness and try and encourage these sites to adopt ssl and do it properly

7618659 the only force we have ever had is that of words
7618660 we talked to hamas and hezbollah and other islamist organisations we talked to the most diverse groups in kosovo because they clearly expressed the legitimate interests of the population

7618681 yes it sounds diabolical but that may be the most accurate way to assess the designs of the mccain campaign in matters of war and peace there is every indication that the candidates demonisation of russian leader putin is an even grander plan than the previous use of saddam to fuel american militarism with the fearsome enemy that it desperately needs
7618682 demonisation of russian leader putin is an even grander plan
7618683 history is full of people who out of fear ignorance or lust for power has destroyed knowledge of immeasurable value which truly belongs to us all we must not let it happen again

7618699 yeah we had a tiff with some cloth eared turkey of a waiter which we regret
7618700 but the right wing media is playing up adultery these days and playing it up big because its the only way they can attack the talent of the left and sometimes bring them down
7618701 even more unfortunately there are some misguided fools in media who think they are doing others a favor by bullying and claiming this is to prepare or strengthen their victims
7618702 a boy doesnt become a man until he is properly sodomized

7618721 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally
7618722 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7618723 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7618724 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7618725 thats it the cycle just continues and or gets worse

7618736 we must put a stop to the violence or it will destroy us all
7618737 our reflection is focused in a particular way on the confrontation that is occurring between students and parents here we see that the culture of violence in which we are submerged has penetrated into the heart of the new generations and could even wound the family itself the fundamental cell of our society
7618738 let us leave aside offensive and violent language let us avoid images of confrontation let us not be overcome by evil but rather overcome evil with good
7618739 to support and increase appropriate initiatives aimed at overcoming situations of poverty
7618740 decisive commitment to foster hard work honesty a spirit of participation and a respect for justice and human rights

7618742 during the course of my absence from the diocese these last few weeks there has been some public interest in the alterations in the pastoral provision for the pontefract and wakefield deaneries of the diocese
7618743 the process that has lead to this decision began throughout the diocese in 2004 and was followed up with a more extensive period of consultation in the deaneries of pontefract and wakefield last autumn
7618744 in addition i have received a request for the provision of mass in the extraordinary form of the latin rite i
7618745 i am aware of how difficult it is for people to leave familiar and much loved churches and i am very conscious of the sadness being felt at this time however as the church we need to look at the future which is being presented to us with prudence and courage and with an eye to providing realistically and therefore as effectively as possible within our means for present and future generations
7618746 published api is like a star once discovered its there foreever
7618747 it is sad but nonetheless a fact that i am no longer able to provide the same number of masses in the many churches of the diocese as in previous years
7618748 however as the church we need to look at the future which is being presented to us with prudence and courage and with an eye to providing realistically and therefore as effectively as possible within our means for present and future generations

7618754 so its not likely to go away in our lifetime
7618755 im absolutely convinced that if we can get conformity in the requirements so that you could follow one protocol in order to qualify for either domestic hormone free marketing or export to the eu i think we can reach a critical mass that will work for our beef industry
7618756 one of the reasons people say they arent interested in feeding cattle for the european market is that not enough of the carcass has been marketed there
7618757 we have the opportunity to change that especially with such a shortage of beef in europe and russia and our product being so competitively priced we even saw significant amounts of u s beef being used to produce sausage

7618808 though this adjudication has been in process for some years the state engineer has refused to recognize any pre 1907 water rights
7618809 in fact the offers of judgment that the state engineer is sending out all offer only a 1906 priority date
7618810 there were about 30 000 acres of land irrigated in new mexico prior to 1900 so it stands to reason that about one third of the irrigated lands in the lower rio grande have a pre 1907 priority of use
7618811 this is a global issue as far as lower rio grande water users are concerned because no allocation of the quantity of water rights or settlements can be made until the priorities have been determined it was recognized by the bureau of reclamation back in 1902 that the normal flow of the rio grande had already been appropriated and that new irrigation could only come from impounded flood waters therefore those who used the normal flow of the river prior to 1906 have first call on the water and their rights cannot be diminished by using the normal flow on new lands irrigated under the rio grande project
7618812 if an irrigator is in doubt as to whether he has pre 1906 water rights he should file a declaration as judge valentine has suggested

7618888 its already got hundreds of thousands of people using it with more every day
7618889 one of our primary reasons for moving toward a single card is the ability for that credential to be trusted by others
7618890 fips 201 didnt drive the project but it helped enable it and push along its adoption
7618891 user name and password are no longer passable stronger authentication is becoming necessary
7618892 its an open standard and provides a strong credential that enables biometrics beyond a facial photograph
7618893 when youre looking at something for the enterprise they want more than just fips 201 it doesnt go far enough
7618894 there will be a fips 201 data model but there will also be a larger data model with the ability to support different identity programs
7618895 it is going to change and it will have greater alignment with a generic card specification
7618896 it doesnt support different use cases that an enterprise would need but then theres some overkill in other areas
7618897 the best way to check in on the way youre standing the way youre sitting the way youre inhabiting your body is to check in on your breathing

7618900 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
7618901 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
7618902 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
7618903 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
7618904 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
7618905 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
7618906 once this technology can be applied to produce specialty chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production

7618926 senator biden has a 35 year record fighting for people against powerful interests whether its drug companies oil companies or insurance companies
7618927 he took plenty of knocks from the largest employer in his state because he demanded changes in the bankruptcy bill but legislating requires compromise senators cast tough votes congress worked on the bankruptcy bill for nearly a decade over five congresses to forge a bipartisan compromise
7618928 senator biden took on entrenched interests and succeeded in improving the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments senator biden had to make the tough calls and voted to pass a bill
7618929 it just so happens that the people who find themselves in terrible economic circumstances through no fault of their own major medical bills they have lost their jobs or there has been a divorce it is my view as a former political scientist and now a senator for the state of minnesota that those people do not have the same kind of clout that mbna corporation has

7618942 the virtual system encourages patients to walk more quickly and for longer almost without them realising it it is not just that they are distracted from the pain by moving faster than they realise their body actually feels it less were effectively fooling the brain and cheating the body
7618943 its a lot more fun than traditional rehab and it can actually facilitate a much faster recovery our test subjects are usually surprised when i tell them theyve improved by up to 20
7618944 the vast majority of stroke survivors cannot use a normal treadmill because they are not in control many can only hold on with one hand making it almost impossible walking is the best possible exercise for their bodies and this system means it could all become available to them
7618945 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments isnt uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it were surprised to learn that we found a new virus
7618946 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are many years away
7618947 most people would go to rats and mice for lab testing but when it comes to testing new wound therapies or products and cosmetics that go on human skin pig skin is our closest alternative and is most often used
7618948 however this is expensive the test numbers are limited and of course there are ethical problems to consider so using a human skin equivalent will reduce this use and possibly give more accurate results
7618949 we collect skin donated by consenting patients who have had surgery resulting in a surgical off cut and the skin is then processed in our laboratory to isolate the cells once they are growing healthily again we can bring them back together and create the multi component skin equivalent in the lab
7618950 so we deconstruct the skin and its cells and then reconstruct them we cannot use the skin off cuts themselves as those cells are dying and we need to get the cells back to a state where are growing healthily again

7618953 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have every right to gain independence
7618954 and one of the main legal principles for recognizing independence is the fundamental principle of international law the right of people to self determination
7618955 we have more political legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized when i say we i mean both south ossetia and abkhazia
7618956 the precedent they most like to cite is kosovo although international law is not based on precedents
7618957 there are many examples in history of both successful resolutions of secession crisis when an internal solution was found within the state and situations when this didnt work out there exists no strict regulation in international law
7618958 political factors recognition and the reaction of countries that dont accept this recognition play a determining role
7618959 neither abkhazia and i will allow myself to speak for south ossetia too nor south ossetia will ever agree to live in one state with georgia and we ask you to cross this barrier which has been so hard to cross for many years and to recognize our republics as independent states
7618960 definitively deprived the georgian leadership of the right to push for the south ossetian and abkhazian dependence on their adventurist polices which have led to a humanitarian catastrophe
7618961 the state duma is appealing to parliaments of the un member states and international parliamentary organizations to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as independent and sovereign countries

7618986 all christians have an important role to play in developing their own environmental awareness and encouraging it in others i am delighted that the church of england now has this helpful guide which will prove invaluable for those wanting to plan their own services and for all those looking to find a deeper theological understanding of our christian concern for creation
7618987 this book offers us not just tips on energy saving but a reorientation the intention is not to urge christians to get measured for a hair shirt but to rediscover how good and joyful a thing it is to dwell together in unity with all that lives

7618992 a birth mother means somebody who loves you very much and you got born in her stomach
7618993 adoption agencies felt everyone would be better off if we pretended the birth mother didnt exist
7618994 looking back its very peculiar but we went along with a history of secrecy a secrecy based on shame
7618995 part of it is women who surrender their children now have more say so quite frankly given supply and demand issues
7618996 what were seeing now is a movement toward understanding how those connections can be good for kids

7619003 one thing i like about it is the part time part of it
7619004 so many kids are rushed into full days of school especially in the city its hard to find part time pre school for parents that have that as an option
7619005 as the teacher im contracted independently for that position parents make all the decisions about pretty much everything

7619009 it came about from us starting to see a lot of applications from people that want to open a restaurant in the city which is great
7619010 but a lot of them were just not prepared not at the stage where they should be asking for financing we want to make sure they are sustainable

7619027 our position is that no option is to be taken off the table but in the meantime we have to make diplomatic progress

7619031 last night i was called an uncle tom by emil jones in the lobby of the hotel right in front of ald freddrenna lyle and ald leslie hairston and ald latasha thomas
7619032 i walked over to him and asked him what did you just call me
7619033 if people are still making digs at the hillary clinton people because we supported her that is not going to bring us on board it makes us feel as though were outsiders and were democrats
7619034 the litmus test for being black is seen as supporting barack
7619035 you can tell the hillary clinton people they never take the buttons
7619036 i told her i never said that she may have misunderstood
7619037 that was not that was not thats all i have to say
7619038 i said then 35 000 people drank the kool aid he said barack is a clean cut guy he never liked gutter politics thats why the clintons did so and so i said i dont want to get into this so i went over to the elevator and he said uncle tom then he grabbed me and hugged me and started laughing i said what did you say i turned to freddrenna lyle and i said what did he say she wouldnt say anything thats when i said some bad things to him
7619039 calling me an uncle tom is beyond the pale especially considering where he is close with mayor daley and with gov blagojevich i am hardly the uncle tom here
7619040 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners

7619075 deforestation is the biggest problem chimps face because this means that their habitat is destroyed
7619076 the snares are meant for other animals sometimes but the chimps get caught
7619077 we carried out a survey recently and found that 20 per cent of all ugandan chimps in the wild have a missing leg an arm or a foot
7619078 they scream they sing they fall down they take their clothes off they cross dress they vomit
7619079 it is only the british people not the germans or the french

7619090 antioxidants sit within this tiny trojan horse protecting it from attack from digestive juices in the stomach
7619091 once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream
7619092 we hope that by mastering this technique drugs and supplements also vulnerable to the digestive process can be better absorbed by the human body
7619093 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
7619094 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
7619095 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
7619096 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7619097 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7619098 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7619099 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7619100 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of

7619106 you would think they would want to embrace the youthful exuberance of his personality and his look then again nike does have a way with these things its hard to argue with their success
7619107 its not like remaking a coca cola bottle rafa has a clear idea of what he wants to be
7619108 its the normal evolution of a person he has changed his tastes have changed
7619109 with colors as vibrant as the culture of majorca rafa will burst onto the court in chlorine blue orange blaze white and concord purple rafas contrasting tones are set to shine day and night in the city that never sleeps

7619121 het getuigt van politieke moed en verantwoordelijkheid dat de vlaamse regering niet overhaast te werk gaat onder druk van het zware lobbywerk in dit dossier
7619122 we hopen dat de vlaamse regering rekening zal houden met de vele bezwaren die heel recent in het milieueffectenrapport mer zijn geopperd
7619123 het is toch evident dat in het dicht bevolkte vlaanderen zuinig moet worden omgesprongen met het ruimtegebruik en dat de twee voetbalverenigingen van brugge in n stadion worden ondergebracht best gebeurt dit op een locatie waar ook plaats is voor jeugdterreinen
7619124 er is dus een alternatief voor de club brugge supporters die afzakken van oost vlaanderen antwerpen en limburg om het nieuwe stadion vlot te bereiken
7619125 we twijfelen dan ook aan de aflevering van de bouwvergunning voor de site in loppem tegen eind 2010 zoals club brugge in haar timing voorziet
7619126 we hebben intussen vertrouwen in de werkgroep die de vlaamse regering in alle objectiviteit moet informeren en adviseren
7619127 you may have heard that companies like general electric and honeywell are making a big splash in china
7619128 lucrative deals are going to chinas best and brightest sons as part of beijings plan to as my colleague bill mann calls it microwave the process of jump starting its industrial revolution
7619129 quickly emerged as chinas clear leader in security technology system installation and monitoring and total security solutions
7619130 in recent months the company snagged coveted lucrative contracts to install camera alarm and response systems in jining a 114 million win and yinchuan a 27 million win under beijings
7619131 meanwhile private sector customers from hotels to banks and factories are implementing its custom solutions and thanks to state ordinance 458 which essentially mandates that they do so even small restaurants bars and discos are getting on board
7619132 dont forget chinas relentless growth demands a steady flow of new factories city streets government buildings airports and shopping malls to be fitted with state of the art surveillance and security systems
7619133 bill mann is convinced that the company could approach 1 billion in sales in five years given a reasonable multiple that earns us anywhere from 17 5 to 27 annualized returns
7619134 we do realize that there will be more failures but its something that we can manage
7619135 we have a pretty significant fund and we have the ability to replenish it
7619136 for a lot of banks the die has already been cast
7619137 the banking industry goes into this mess much stronger than it was
7619138 as the fdic incurs losses those losses will be passed back to the banking industry
7619139 we had one of the largest and certainly what we think will be one of the most expensive failures at the beginning of the cycle
7619140 although its going to be challenging its not going to be all that bad
7619141 if anyone has a deposit of less than 100 000 they can sleep as soundly as always
7619142 i was shocked that the fdic did not have indymac on its watch list until a month before
7619143 you may have an inexperienced team remember for the last 13 or 14 years the banking industry has been pretty benign
7619144 they knew their funds were insured they still lined up and took their money out
7619145 weve had three failures since indymac and they all went smoothly
7619146 i feel that we did recognize it and did what we could
7619147 we are in various stages of negotiation with most of the major carriers and talking to all of them
7619148 its going to be a carrier by carrier decision but you can see clearly that onboard broadband access is the wave of the future
7619149 were rolling internet out quickly and making access available to customers on about 75 delta aircraft by the end of the year and expanding to the rest of our domestic mainline fleet 330 aircraft by next summer
7619150 the female chimps we observed in the wild seemed to be much more concerned with having sex with many different males without other females finding out about it than causing male chimps to fight over them
7619151 competition between females can be dangerously high in wild chimpanzees
7619152 copulation calling therefore may be one potential strategy employed by female chimpanzees to advertise their receptivity to high ranked males confuse paternity and secure future support from these socially important individuals
7619153 when an infant dies a female will sometimes carry it round for a number of days grooming it and exhibiting stressful behaviour
7619154 los mejores momentos de la vida vienen por si solos

7619156 when i started there were about 200 members but when the whole thing exploded worldwide there were about 40 000
7619157 they started at about 50 a week depending on how many performances they played which wasnt too bad for those days
7619158 they were always genuine we had rollers with their signatures but we never used them because the beatles especially john hated them they thought it was cheating the fans which as one myself i thought so too
7619159 george was the best one for doing this he would come into the office and i would give him a pile of books of photos and say while youre in with eppie epstein could you sign these and he would every one
7619160 he did have his moods but i learned to stay clear when he did
7619161 i was on the balcony behind them looking out over castle street which was absolutely choc a bloc with people it was incredible
7619162 because bats can detect objects with echolocation they seldom collide with man made structures
7619163 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
7619164 given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue
7619165 slow reproductive rates can limit a populations ability to recover from crashes and thereby increase the risk of endangerment or extinction
7619166 acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is based on a plant stress hormone
7619167 i asked myself could there be other plant stress hormones that have clinical efficacy while various studies have suggested that aspirin can prevent cancer especially colon cancer i realized that there could be a chance to find a potent plant hormone that could fight cancer even better i pinpointed jasmonate
7619168 the jasmonate compound is used widely in agriculture and in cosmetics
7619169 proven to be non toxic it has the same regulatory status as table salt that and the fact we are working on a natural chemical gives us a good starting point for launching a new drug
7619170 has already been shown to have selective anticancer activity in preclinical studies and this finding may stimulate the development of a novel class of small anticancer compounds
7619171 i once had the degree of my deviated septum operated on since then i can breathe much better and sleep nights like a baby the china daily quoted her as saying the rest of my body is all mine and absolutely natural and it s going to stay that way i am very satisfied with what god gave me

7619190 we are of the opinion that the collar shown in the visuals is totally inappropriate and unacceptable
7619191 we can take them to three troops each of which has a collared animal and if any of those collared animals is showing any signs of tugging at the collar or worrying about it we will take it off immediately
7619192 but since deploying the collars weve seen every animal and not once have we seen any sign of distress caused by the collar and the suggestion that they cant groom is nonsense
7619193 but we have to weigh that up against the possible merits which to me far outweigh any inconvenience thats what the ethics committees are there for to assess the potential scientific merit of the work against that inconvenience
7619194 and the scientific merit of this work is worth the method and the method will provide an important conservation improvement to the status of these baboons
7619195 las comparaciones son vergonzosas e inaceptables claramente muestran que cuando se trata de apoyar a obama sus celebridades se niegan a considerar cualquier ataque o calumnia fuera de los l mites

7619222 how many calvinists does it take the change a light bulb
7619223 when god is pleased to change the light bulb god will do it without your help or mine and theres no reason for us to worry about it
7619224 the path of righteousness is like the light of dawn which shines brighter and brighter
7619225 sometimes our light goes out but is blown into flame by another human being each of us owes deepest thanks to those who have rekindled this light
7619226 when he came there was no light when he died there was no darkness
7619227 let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to your father in heaven
7619228 when her fellow traffic agents came back from a stressful day on the job they could always count on donnette to lighten their mood with a joke or a funny comment
7619229 we take stories and storytelling for granted the great reservoir of myths legends parables tales that we dip into for entertainment use for films and plays refer to so as to elucidate a point or draw a parallel it is always there and we hardly think about it tales are as old as humanity like a long shadow thrown by our history how old we don t know whenever we reach a point where it seems impossible to go back further then we can be sure that soon the dark of our ignorance will yield to research and behold it is evident that the long shadow showed itself much earlier that we had thought we have not until recently been asking ourselves what is the function of story telling what are stories for and that s extraordinary in itself we tell stories all the time everybody does recording our experience perhaps even shaping it when a woman returns from a supermarket and says guess what i saw dick in the cheese department but he wasnt with betty he was with some new woman that is the beginning and the middle of a story though we do not know the end yet we tell each other stores all the day and we daydream and fantasize and when we fall asleep we tell stories again for dreams are stories not only wildly surreal but as a matter of fact and consistent as a b movie they can be horrific or funny or entertaining or even instructive telling you things your conscious mind has not yet caught up with

7619231 last night i was called an uncle tom by emil jones in the lobby of the hotel right in front of ald freddrenna lyle and ald leslie hairston and ald latasha thomas
7619232 i walked over to him and asked him what did you just call me
7619233 if people are still making digs at the hillary clinton people because we supported her that is not going to bring us on board it makes us feel as though were outsiders and were democrats
7619234 the litmus test for being black is seen as supporting barack
7619235 you can tell the hillary clinton people they never take the buttons
7619236 i told her i never said that she may have misunderstood
7619237 that was not that was not thats all i have to say
7619238 i said then 35 000 people drank the kool aid he said barack is a clean cut guy he never liked gutter politics thats why the clintons did so and so i said i dont want to get into this so i went over to the elevator and he said uncle tom then he grabbed me and hugged me and started laughing i said what did you say i turned to freddrenna lyle and i said what did he say she wouldnt say anything thats when i said some bad things to him
7619239 calling me an uncle tom is beyond the pale especially considering where he is close with mayor daley and with gov blagojevich i am hardly the uncle tom here
7619240 he turned 46 this summer and hes got a 29 year old wife and a young family so he wanted to get back in shape
7619241 david has been round at toms house a lot while katie and victoria have been swapping fashion tips on the phone david has been advising tom on diet
7619242 tom has had to watch his weight for years because hes not that tall and puts on weight easily

7619249 lets not forget dell is still highly tied to the u s more so than hp is which is much more diversified on a global basis in terms of markets
7619250 they are trying to grow international markets they are trying to come up with some channel strategies so i think thats helping them
7619251 it could be argued that ibm had strength in the high end and dell had strength in the low end of x86 plus a nice kick in its 4 socket business
7619252 i am yet to be convinced they are luring new customers
7619253 i think sun with its ultrasparc and x86 has not been effectively selling outside their traditional customer base
7619254 i held onto it medal for three days just to make sure it is not a dream that it was real

7619256 olympics were the biggest goal of the year for me all my preparation from the beginning of the year was playing singles i wanted to make sure i saved some energy for the olympics
7619257 for a russian athlete nothing is bigger and more important than the olympic gold medal
7619258 in russia if you stop someone on the street and ask them what is a grand slam they cant tell you
7619259 but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger or more important than the olympic games for a sportsperson
7619260 there was a lot of people and a lot of flowers

7619264 new york has really struggled to find its way from industrial city to post industrial
7619265 one of the solutions is to rezone formally industrial neighborhoods
7619266 they want to make it an island of rich people
7619267 communities claim that i got upzoned and im a working class neighborhood and other areas got downzoned because they have more political clout
7619268 the mayor has proposed and the council has approved a great deal of development
7619269 one question that goes along with this is what about all of the infrastructure that should be going along with this
7619270 if were talking about public policy you need to provide for the majority needs of the community not for the minority needs coming in
7619271 right now its from the top down the administration and the city planning determine the zoning
7619272 when were talking about public participation sitting down and being willing to talk before rezoning happens is one thing
7619273 there is another thing that is working with the community beforehand to create proactive plans
7619274 i think what we need is a comprehensive citywide plan or planning framework
7619275 i think we just need to have that conversation as a city

7619286 is a reflection of increased sales of foreclosed homes at very low prices rather than a pick up in the regular private sales market but they all count
7619287 the rebound in existing home sales does not indicate the beginning of a recovery in the housing market as the level of excess supply continues to rise and sales prices keep falling suggesting that the downward adjustment in prices is not over
7619288 sales have picked up significantly in several florida and california markets home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time
7619289 the recent upward pressure on retail mortgage rates due to pressures on gse borrowing rates and further weakening in the employment market threatens to delay the expected housing market recovery

7619296 it is only the british people not the germans or the french
7619297 these people are giving a bad name to their country
7619298 its because of british culture no one can relax so they become inebriated to be the people they want to be
7619299 the statements made by condoleezza rice and george w bush about the recent hostilities between georgia and russia did not raise an eyebrow from obama or mccain nor did they raise questions from those that comment on all things political the recent chiding given to russia by bush and rice that this is the 21st century and that sovereign nations do not invade other sovereign nations was hysterically amusing if the deaths of more than a million iraqis and thousands of dead americans werent involved this would be a great plot for a big screen comedy hit

7619334 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7619335 furthermore because there already are drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7619336 this is a very important discovery as it not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
7619337 this finding means that it is possible to offer simple non invasive screening for patients with a family history of neuroblastoma
7619338 as we increase our knowledge of alk mutations we will also offer specialized diagnostic testing for all newly diagnosed patients with neuroblastoma to eventually allow oncologists to better customize treatment to a childs genetic profile
7619339 its an advantage to be able to start with agents that have already been shown to be safe in adults
7619340 together with this current study we are defining the genetic events that underlie this childhood cancer
7619341 better understanding of these biological pathways will guide our efforts to develop more effective treatments
7619342 social support buffers the effects of terrorism on adolescent depression findings from sderot israel
7619343 this provided an exceptional and unique opportunity to examine risk and resilience processes in such a heavily burdened population
7619344 these findings highlight the potential importance of community mental health efforts as protective resources in times of traumatic stress more research on the subject is necessary to determine the extent to which support helps students cope with the difficulties
7619345 hospice and palliative medicine is a newly recognized medical subspecialty
7619346 this unique specialty reflects the need for specialized medical care for the growing number of older adults and persons with serious complex and chronic illnesses which currently pose an enormous challenge to the healthcare industry
7619347 there is a much greater demand than supply of physicians skilled in hospice and palliative medicine
7619348 well trained physicians in this field have unlimited opportunities aahpm is steadily expanding educational opportunities so that physicians who want to move into hospice and palliative medicine have more learning opportunities
7619349 the unipac book series helps to form a strong foundation for developing these skills
7619350 like good textbooks the unipac booklets have multiple contributors and have been peer reviewed by the leaders in the field
7619351 given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke of burning incense these findings carry significant public health implications
7619352 besides initiatives to reduce incense smoke exposure future studies should be undertaken to identify the least harmful types of incense
7619353 certain reproductive factors may have a greater impact on risk of certain molecular subtypes of disease compared to others
7619354 because bats can detect objects with echolocation they seldom collide with man made structures
7619355 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
7619356 given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue
7619357 slow reproductive rates can limit a populations ability to recover from crashes and thereby increase the risk of endangerment or extinction
7619358 in a longstanding mystery smoking high cholesterol and lack of exercise should drive disease to develop evenly throughout all blood vessels but in reality atherosclerotic lesions tend to cluster where vessels branch
7619359 our study provides new insight into why and suggests how the protection afforded by the force of steady flow and simple stretch might be strengthened with drugs
7619360 obviously we should all be exercising to get our hearts pumping fast which increases blood flow force through our vessels
7619361 beyond that genetic engineers may in the future design gene therapy that delivers genes only into cells at blood vessel branch points to increase pecam 1 signaling alternatively drug designers might create super active fyn amplifying the signaling effects of pecam 1 phosphorylation to protect vulnerable areas of blood vessels from inflammation

7619509 if tomorrow peace broke out between israelis and palestinians does anybody think there wouldnt be a full blown war in iraq
7619510 is that many americans can taste what it must feel like for every israeli mother and father when they send their kid out to school with their lunch to put them on a bus on a bicycle or to walk and they pray to god that cell phone doesnt ring

7619528 after discovering that thermal expansion of steel from a low temperature fire led to the collapse of world trade center building 7
7619529 we started realizing that other metal objects might also be at risk
7619530 we also determined that car engines airplane engines and boat engines could all suddenly fail due to thermal expansion
7619531 indeed we soon realized that almost all industrial processes could lead to catastrophic failure other than perhaps those used in freezers
7619532 once you understand this principle of thermal expansion you start to realize that even household showerheads and faucets are dangerous the hot water flowing through them could wreak havoc the president is committed to leading the way back to a safer time and a return to proven traditional materials which may not be flashy like metal but remain rock solid even when warm

7619538 for indias middle class urban women the past decade has brought unprecedented opportunities to advance in a social order long dominated by men but a powerful male backlash has accompanied the womens revolution an upwelling of resentment that has expressed itself in sexual violence and harassment
7619539 in india today women are working in lucrative retail and technology jobs sometimes in cities far from their home towns economic independence has in some cases allowed them to delay marriage and early childbirth social mobility among indias young is also undermining the countrys traditional joint family system in which couples are expected to move in with the husbands parents the shift has empowered the modern indian wife freeing her from the scourge of the bossy nosy mother in law

7619550 sports is one of the most popular interests in the school this can be seen by the fact that the athletes needs are met through designing special programs consideration of their needs consideration of their teachers competitions and placing the school athletics program high on our list of priorities
7619551 sports is as popular a subject as communications and electronics but sports raise school pride while other areas of study do not
7619552 they are cognizant of their own needs but not the needs of others its not a good part of their character or their personality the contempt for others their condescending behavior and their feeling of superiority
7619553 for young athletes those that are active in sports leagues and primarily those that represent their school there are unique needs that require special handling given that the focus on athletic achievements and the pride they bring the school could harm other educational values that students should be taught

7619582 ill say straight up that john mccain is genuinely a friend of mine
7619583 ive known john for 35 years he served our country with extraordinary courage and i know he wants to do right by america but the harsh harsh truth is you cant change america when you quote and these are johns words the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support with president bush what he said

7619642 you mean that the us did not say that in exchange for deploying the x band system israel needs to receive us permission to attack iran
7619643 the basic idea is that a us ally getting nuked is a bad thing the x band system increases the likelihood that such an attack would fail
7619644 will send a message to iran that israel has powerful political support from its ally against any iranian threat
7619645 if the israeli government makes the difficult decision that it must launch a preemptive attack against iran that is when israel will need its allies the most and that is when the us will be called in to show what it means to have us as an ally

7619794 el gobierno estimo no va a impulsar una pol tica devaluatoria agresiva como la que esperar a parte del sector privado
7619795 por otra parte no va a dejar caer el d lar como en los ltimos meses porque atentar a contra el tipo de cambio competitivo que es un baluarte del modelo

7619802 your television ads keep saying things that are not true and you have refused to accept my proposals to have a debate
7619803 we need to stand in public and be truthful this is a public building its paid for by taxpayers money and so there is no reason no reason at all that you cannot agree now to a debate
7619804 when we can arrange our schedule we will meet for a debate
7619805 i have a job to do were not going to do it on your demands we have said publicly when we can arrange our schedule we will meet were not going to do it on your demands not here or there ok i expect the invitations soon
7619806 we have both received invitations but kuhl has not responded
7619807 some people want to be disrespectful and want to be interuptive for their own political gain
7619808 this event was not campaign related and it was shamefully and frankly sad that massa tried to turn the attention away from our first responders and back to himself
7619809 and the time for action is now the energy issue is the most critical our country has economically i hope changes will come before the end of the year
7619810 i understand you are trying to make this a political issue but youre not going to

7619824 for tom if we decide to play him then that will be an opportunity for him and if we dont decide to play him or he cant play or whatever it is then it will be an opportunity for someone else
7619825 if certain players dont play then the other players at that position get more of an opportunity to play whatever spot that is
7619826 that is something that matt cassel gutierrez and kevin i think all look for that opportunity to play their position get a chance to perform contribute and show what they can do
7619827 last friday night we saw a little over a half with cassel and less than a half with gutierrez i am sure this week against the giants we will see kevin get a chance to play some and we will figure out what the rest of the playing time is based on everyones availability and so forth
7619828 i thought matt did a good job leading the team with the opportunities he had
7619829 thats my responsibility to try to stay calm and recognize what they are doing and run our offense
7619830 at times we did a decent job at other times we didnt we strung some plays together but the drives still werent perfect there is still a lot of room for improvement we came up short on points so whatever job we did it still wasnt enough

7619845 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7619846 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7619847 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7619848 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7619849 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table shes been as an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy and simon offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist to the thousands who have competed on american idol with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7619850 im more of a conservative good government type of guy
7619851 the republicans know ford is the weaker candidate they want him to win the primary
7619852 they had used the wrong name on the document so i insisted that they correct the name before they could take her away i reminded them that they had to bring her home within the stipulated 12 hours
7619853 she told them that it was not illegal to take photographs in a public place and she had not visited any secret areas or military installations they had no legal basis for holding her
7619854 i cant say whether their intention was to intimidate but if they can do this to an influential writer who has done nothing more than take photographs then one can only imagine the kind of threat that ordinary people in tibet must feel every day

7619861 we advised that limiting auditor liability would reduce audit firm accountability provide a market incentive to take audit shortcuts and reduce overall audit quality
7619862 protect the community of auditors particularly the larger ones to the detriment of other stakeholders and especially shareholders
7619863 after in depth research and extensive consultation we have concluded that unlimited liability combined with insufficient insurance cover is no longer tenable
7619864 it is a potentially huge problem for our capital markets and for auditors working on an international scale
7619865 the current conditions are not only preventing the entry of new players in the international audit market but are also threatening existing firms
7619866 in a context of high concentration and limited choice of audit firms this situation could lead to damaging consequences for european capital markets
7619867 a comprehensive federal response should minimize if not eliminate the possibility that persons within the flds who may be predisposed to commit polygamy or other crimes will simply move their operations to another location
7619868 i am still waiting for a response to that request

7619876 we continue to have the same goal which is to reach agreement by the end of the year
7619877 we have a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here
7619878 its extremely important to just keep making forward progress rather than prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
7619879 ultimately gaza has to be resolved and it has to be resolved on the basis of abu mazens abbass program for it

7619885 were still swapping ideas back and forth with the teams
7619886 basically all we did was meet for 15 minutes as an informational deal to let everybody know what changes had been suggested and so on and so forth
7619887 a test day right now would consist of two transporters leaving the shop they could be fully loaded in other words each transporter could have two cars in it they can bring as many of their drivers as they want to
7619888 the teams are welcome to go there indianapolis but as far as nascar sanctioning a test there no
7619889 the teams have that option and theyre more than welcome to do it weve been to indianapolis for 14 years 15 including the 2008 race

7619891 e il coronamento di unavventura iniziata due anni fa a rimini
7619892 non siamo ancora in champions ha commentato nedved prima della partenza per bratislava ci manca lultimo passo questa sar lultima tappa di un ciclo iniziato due anni fa a rimini vogliamo chiuderlo bene e iniziarne subito uno nuovo e vincente

7619897 at the establishment of our constitutions the judiciary bodies were supposed to be the most helpless and harmless members of the government experience however soon showed in what way they were to become the most dangerous that the insufficiency of the means provided for their removal gave them a freehold and irresponsibility in office that their decisions seeming to concern individual suitors only pass silent and unheeded by the public at large that these decisions nevertheless become law by precedent sapping by little and little the foundations of the constitution and working its change by construction before any one has perceived that that invisible and helpless worm has been busily employed in consuming its substance in truth man is not made to be trusted for life if secured against all liability to account
7619898 this kind of a prank is nothing to be proud of it was stupid and did not require any technical expertise like you might think
7619899 a foreigner may not realize the potential consequences of airing such commercial and that they could cause further mistrust of politicians and ultimately damage the countrys democracy
7619900 the candidates are risking that the proposals being put forth by their campaigns are not in accordance with the panamanian idiosyncrasies
7619901 there are also problems of attitude and self esteem that panamanians must overcome if we really want to be more competitive
7619902 ever wonder what washington has done with your tax dollars this olympics is your chance to find out for the last 8 years the bush administration has been paying china billions of dollars in interest on the trillions it borrowed for tax breaks pork and special privileges you never got that money helped create thousands of businesses and millions of jobs in china so as you enjoy the games keep an eye on your tax dollars at work the way our economys going its tough to pay your bills but take heart you already paid chinas

7619909 that should tell you something about the velocity the vehicle was travelling with
7619910 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time

7619920 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7619921 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7619922 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7619923 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7619924 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7619925 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7619926 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7619927 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7619928 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7619929 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7619930 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7619931 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7619932 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7619933 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it

7619939 back in june and july i truly thought he was going to blow mccain out of the water and carry 30 or 40 states
7619940 what has happened is that republicans mccain specifically have really twisted his great charisma this electric personality to discredit his ability his experience his capacity his judgment i fear they are about to do to him what they did to gore
7619941 obama has got to do some things that will shore up his ability to lead not just to charm but to lead theyve got to give credibility to his understanding of foreign policy his ability to deal with tough people and tough questions and his ability to be more explicit and convincing on his health care policies and energy policies
7619942 normally i might say these conventions are not so important but i dont think thats the case this year
7619943 i think in the case of mccain they need to frame him
7619944 viscerally my feeling is theyve got to come back at him hard

7619964 my convention speech is an important moment for me to share what ive come to see and know about an extraordinary public servant during the last 20 years as president barack obama will bring our country together and move us forward to meet the challenges that we all face he will lead our nation back on the path to peace and prosperity

7619966 antes del inicio de cada discusi n le damos prioridad al sector productivo a los secaderos e industriales que son los que est n en el negocio para que sean los que en primera instancia discutan los valores nosotros como estado vamos a acompa ar toda la l nea de discusi n buscando un consenso
7619967 vamos a realizar un acompa amiento de mejor a para los precios pero fundamentalmente es necesario que se arbitre el cumplimiento de los valores acordados
7619968 vamos a ver cuales son los ndices de actualizaci n de la estructura de costos teniendo en cuenta el aumento en el salario de los trabajadores rurales decretado recientemente por la naci n desde ese lugar veremos cuales ser n nuestros planteos y la estrategia del gobierno provincial

7619971 este producto sale m s barato que la pipeta y el collar anti leshmaniasis y posee la misma droga
7619972 mi estrategia fue mantener un ritmo bastante fuerte desde el inicio despu s redoblar el esfuerzo sobre el final y el triunfo se lo dedico a mi mam que siempre me incentiva para que siga en el atletismo as que gracias a ella hoy pude ganar
7619973 ya particip en varias competencias de atletismo ahora estar en el campeonato provincial y mi objetivo es poder clasificar para el nacional
7619974 es una l stima que no tengamos representantes en argentina tenemos a varios deportistas muy buenos pero por carencias econ micas no pueden ir
7619975 esta es la segunda vez que participo en eldorado el a o pasado termin tercera y esta temporada ten a que poner todo porque ven a entrenando muy fuerte en un principio me pareci muy linda la prueba porque hab a un buen clima luego sali el sol hizo mucho m s calor pero por suerte la pude sobrellevar
7619976 cada uno elabora su manera para competir pero creo que para todos los ltimos metros fueron los m s exigentes porque todos apuran el ritmo ahora tengo que pensar en la prueba por la fiesta del inmigrante de ober pero mi idea es apuntar al campenato nacional juvenil que se llevar a cabo en salta
7619977 creo que es penoso el nivel demostrado en los panamericanos fue bueno pero los atletas tienen que solventarse solos todos los gastos adem s ser un deporte amateur ya juega en contra porque el trabajo ya es un desgaste una ocupaci n m s en la mente el atletismo es una actividad en la que uno se debe dedicar al cien por ciento
7619978 vine desde san pablo para esta competencia y posiblemente otra tambi n en argentina ya estuve el a o pasado y me gust fui cuarto y entonces ten a que regresar para intentar llevarme el primer puesto mi objetivo es siempre ser primero
7619979 gan porque soy muy fuerte mis oponentes tambi n sobre el final dar o pi eyro quien termin segundo me persegu a muy de cerca as que en los ltimos metros tuve que apresurar el paso
7619980 en los ltimo a os evolucion mucho el atletismo en mi pa s aun falta mucho para mejorar pero est mejor que antes sin embargo se le tiene que dar m s valor a los atletas este deporte en general tiene poco apoyo y esto es as en toda sudam rica y la verdad no s por qu creo que el pueblo no le da credibilidad al atletismo como profesi n es un trabajo igual que otro deporte como el f tbol o el automovilismo nosotros sufrimos y peleamos en busca del mismo objetivo ganar un t tulo ser campe n y representar a nuestro pa s
7619981 estamos felices y muy contentos fue una fiesta largaron un total de 3300 participantes en la categor a general y aproximadamente 1100 en las series de las escuelas con estos n meros pr cticamente duplicamos la cantidad de la edici n del a o pasado
7619982 estamos muy contentos por la ayuda de nuestros sponsors en total recaudamos algo m s que 70 mil pesos lo que se volcar al rea de pediatr a del hospital samic de eldorado y el de esperanza adem s al programa de desnutrici n infantil de la capital del trabajo fueron muchas las empresas que nos dieron una mano por lo que estamos muy agradecidos y esperamos que sigan participando en las pr ximas ediciones

7619997 an update of this size could have theoretically been pushed back to later in the year
7619998 using data from steel minimills the study shows that teams had the greatest impact if they tackled complex tasks in these environments enjoyed meaningful incentives and knew that management listened to them
7619999 there is one caveat the teams gains are significant only when they are addressing complex processes such as improving product quality or solving assembly line problems not relatively simple tasks such as organizing shifts
