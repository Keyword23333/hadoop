6660010 she gave me no choice her methods of torture the emotional manipulation it was beyond what i could understand one instance she could relate to me on a human level then she was a sadistic monster torturing me without emotion in attempt to make me finish the machine
6660011 its not your fault this terminator is skynets mockery of our humanity so we will use her to our advantage now i want you to help me i know you want to in fact you will thats an order david
6660012 so theres my story and i tell you to this day it took nearly two months to get me back to my sanity i will never forget what happened to me and i hope my parents and jehovah will forgive me for the terrible things ive done in my life
6660013 no cameron its not in fact you may end up living that story thats why i asked john if i could fix this and fortunately he has allowed that
6660014 ok cameron you know what to do when john sends you back right
6660015 yes i have all the objectives that john has programed in my directory i know what to do and if i bump into you i am prepared to do my part david
6660016 think she will do her job and fix all this crap
6660017 one can only hope right at least you parents survived judgment day at least we changed something hopefully we will reap what we sow
6660018 like you always say john the future is not set the future is whatever we make it and i hope more than ever that this will be true
6660019 the surge in students applying to university courtyard is consistent with other university housing operations across the u s
6660020 throughout the summer we have been attempting to increase the number of bed spaces we have available on campus and we will continue to try to accommodate those that are currently on our waiting list throughout the beginning of the fall semester
6660021 hey mom look there is a naked guy in the alley come quick hes hiding behind those trash cans over there
6660022 cameron its you how did you survive all this time with out being destroyed by john
6660023 i dont understand you mean that your a real person
6660024 last time i checked yeah and by the way how did you get in our house im calling the cops
6660025 um no wait i did use to live here i swear dont call the police please
6660026 i didnt know anybody lived here anymore i came in from my old back door like my dad used to do as a teenager give me a chance to explain please
6660027 if you know him i can explain my entire situation
6660028 yes hes my father you know him are you like his crazy friend or something
6660029 he is we are old friends will he be home soon just give me a chance to explain this
6660030 if you are such old friends why is it that i never heard about you
6660031 your plan worked we prevented skynet john you did it i dont know how but you did it
6660032 by the way whats up with cameron what happened to her
6660033 its fine hannah hes just a friend whos had a very bad day
6660034 david we need to talk sometimes you can be a little slow young man by the way her name is not cameron its hannah hannah loraine a connor shes my daughter
6660035 but how is it that the robot in the past looks exactly your daughter
6660036 so theres my story and i tell you to this day i will never forget it and i hope my parents will never forget either john prevented skynet or did he really was it ever going to come in reality i will never know but john became a jehovahs witness with his family while my parents marty and jennifer mcfly got to live a peaceful life until they pasted away derek and i became friends and kyle never had to be sent back to protect sarah connor because the machines were never made i only hope we can continue to still live in happiness without worrying about our future anymore ill always remember what john connor said the future is not set the future is whatever we make it and as you can see weve made the right choices huh its funny how the rest of the world will never realize what i have gone through
6660037 i dont know if i will ever understand your or my fathers past honey you keep telling me that story an but what matters now is that we have god and each other to get through anything ok i love you no matter what happened to you in your past

6660045 obviously we are anxious to get the system repaired and bring the plant back on line as soon as possible
6660046 the conduct of the security service facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states when mohamed was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer
6660047 they didnt draft him that high to sit on the bench
6660048 when he signed his contract when he came in two days late i grabbed him and i kind of laid it out for him
6660049 i said this is what you can expect from me and this is why
6660050 hes a bright guy and hes a very good player the worst thing that can happen is that the players off balance and he doesnt understand why im dumping on him he understands thats clear thats been said now its up to him hes going to be fine
6660051 i really feel he is the player we thought he was when we drafted him
6660052 honestly i dont think about what my role is going to be
6660053 my focus is just to be as good a player as i can be that includes special teams every day theres a lot to focus on as far as technique blocking running routes
6660054 its the highest level of football the tempo is much faster the speed at which you have to make decisions is much faster
6660055 there was a deluge of rain and that incorporated with the high tide produced severe flooding
6660056 we need some stability here because its not going anywhere the way it is right now
6660057 we need something strong especially here in michigan everything is going overseas somebodys got to step in and do something
6660058 arent going to vote for obama because hes black because of rumors that hes muslim
6660059 because terrorists theyre mostly muslim im more of a christian anyway
6660060 muslims are totally different they will not go to a christian church they might talk about it but they wont go im from iraq so i know
6660061 its probably a big deal to the country but if hes here and hes american then he can be our president everyone has different backgrounds
6660062 this countrys pretty racist it is its too bad but it is
6660063 im kind of tired of all the republicans and bush they aint doing stuff right the economy is screwed up the unemployment we need a change
6660064 i think what hes talking about change is a good thing mccain seems more or less just like bush
6660065 you cant even get a job at mcdonalds right now
6660066 i dont think things have gotten much better in iraq though its costing us a ton of money
6660067 the money weve spent over there im not sure what weve accomplished we could have solved a lot of problems in this world if we didnt spend trillions of dollars in iraq
6660068 i know obama brings a lot of youthfulness to the campaign but mccains experience alone i feel he could give our country the boost it needs right now i think he can make things happen more quickly
6660069 im 60 and if you wake me up in the middle of the night and something went wrong im a mess
6660070 both candidates you cant really trust but id rather take obama i think hes got more going on
6660071 is tough i know that he wants defense against everything he wants war thats the way i look at it he wants to be in war he doesnt want to be avoiding it
6660072 both candidates can shape their message in such a way that people think their economic survival is going to be assured
6660073 there are other issues in other parts of the country but in michigan thats it
6660074 the appellant has not submitted any affidavits or other evidence beyond his own declaration further his declaration does not articulate if or why he was unable to provide such additional evidence we conclude therefore that while the appellant provided an adequately detailed declaration articulating prejudice to his employment opportunities he has not met his additional burden to provide corroborating evidence or an explanation of why such evidence could not be obtained consequently this fourth factor of prejudice weighs in favor of the government
6660075 e ven in the absence of specific prejudice to the appellant the delay in the post trial review of this case is so egregious that tolerating it would adversely affect the publics perception of the fairness and integrity of the military justice system consequently we hold that the appellants due process right to speedy post trial review has been violated
6660076 having found constitutional error we must now determine if the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt to determine if relief is required
6660077 government responds with no evidence beyond an assertion that the appellants claims are without supporting proof and are unverified and speculative
6660078 structural discrimination against those who are vulnerable to hiv such as sex workers and msm men who have sex with men must be removed if our prevention care and treatment programmes are to succeed
6660079 section 377 of the indian penal code which criminalises men who have sex with men must go
6660080 we are seeing the beginning of the stabilisation of the hiv epidemic in india
6660081 voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man woman or animal
6660082 there are lots of changes taking place in the social milieu and many people have different sexual preferences which are even not considered to be unnatural
6660083 therefore it is high time that the provisions of law which was made more than a century ago is looked at again
6660084 im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games

6660105 that was really the only suspicious thing about the letter and our national headquarters advised out of an abundance of caution for our staff and volunteers that we have the authorities check it out
6660106 there were maybe a couple of grains of something inside an envelope and they had to kind of work to get a sample

6660109 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
6660110 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
6660111 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
6660112 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws

6660136 its essential for victims of homophobic hate crime to understand that criminal justice agencies are there to help them
6660137 at times i think were seen as an easy target who can be picked on i suppose the presumption is that nobody will stick up for us and that were fair game
6660138 to begin with i didnt go to the police about some of these things it didnt occur to me there was any law against the name calling i didnt think i would get a sympathetic hearing from the police
6660139 a lot of my friends who are lesbian and gay told me of negative experiences that theyve had when they tried reporting crime there tends to be this negative idea in the community and it puts people off
6660140 they put some handfuls of potential flammable rubbish through the letterbox the local secondary school was burnt to the ground not very far from where were living and it made me very frightened at that time that we might be at risk of an arson attack
6660141 it was at that point that i involved the hate crime officers from that point on i felt as if the service we were receiving from the police improved enormously
6660142 the fire service came and assess the fire safety of the house and the police started to take us more seriously really and to pursue the culprits more effectively

6660152 uganda used to be a champion in hiv prevention but now we are doing poorly
6660153 when hiv patients take arvs and become better they relax and start playing sex carelessly which has increased our infection rate
6660154 when a man tests for hiv and finds out that he is positive he decides to go and kill a wife as we have been reading in the press this is dangerous because the woman might be negative to be sure couples are advised to go together for treatment because they can access counselling on how to live together if one is found hiv negative and the other positive
6660155 we must quickly scale up prevention measures and promote earlier diagnosis and treatment of hiv as a strategy to yield prevention benefits at population level

6660167 now is it really too much to ask for something like this in my backyard
6660168 how could i develop a new relationship with my daughter if i was to keep my mouth shut
6660169 i bite my tongue but i have so much to say
6660170 dont bite your tongue how to foster rewarding relationships with your adult children
6660171 this very important yet underdeveloped topic needed the attention that ruth has now given it
6660172 shes very warm patient an excellent listener and has a terrific sense of humor
6660173 she defuses the narrative so its more constructive yes something has happened
6660174 i might not talk about it at that moment as everything in life is timing
6660175 one day it could mean being compassionate and another day it could mean being high achieving with conflicting desires so there is no perfection
6660176 it may be because theyre busy at work and trying to support their family
6660177 isnt this fabulous that my child takes his or her job seriously
6660178 tell them what you expect and invite your returning child to do the same
6660179 agreeing together about the rules of the house before your adult child returns may be key to preventing every out of place coffee cup shoe or t shirt from becoming a cue to reenact past dramas
6660180 if you give advice remind adult children that they dont need to follow it
6660181 i threw a wrap around my body and nursed the baby
6660182 i said oh fine shes nursing and he became bright red as he hadnt noticed
6660183 as our children grow we continue to learn more from them and respect their expertise whether its professional or personal
6660184 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6660185 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6660231 a lot of my graduate students considered her their surrogate mother
6660232 our goal is to get the iphone client out as quickly as possible because it does represent a significant percentage of the devices touching our network

6660234 the current funding model for transportation needs in north carolina is failing us and will continue to fail us going forward

6660245 the district attorneys office dismissed it as absurd citing the absence of feathers and most people labeled it as ridiculous
6660246 always the same question was asked by the authorities and the press where are the feathers well folks we are here today announcing the feather has been found
6660247 its not often you have goose down floating around in the middle of the night
6660248 i really believe its not germane i will say that i do know what its like to have a father in prison and if peterson didnt do this its both unfair for him and the boys and girls

6660251 i have long believed it is the wrong item to tax and there should be a total elimination
6660252 you have to look at fiscal responsibility the priority i believe in addition to cutting the food tax is to provide adequate funding for teachers and to clean up the environment
6660253 to be fair it has always been a challenge because they are two top players
6660254 the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery
6660255 when this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports it was the first domino in the chain
6660256 we use what has generally been the accepted method which is to take all the years and average them together
6660257 if she wants to have an argument whether shes voted 92 percent of the time with bush or whether shes voted with him 88 percent of the time i think thats an argument that wed be happy to have
6660258 quite frankly if dole wanted to actually be independent from this president and his failed policies shes had five years in which to do it before now
6660259 now she is caught in a lie and vows to continue telling it
6660260 despite the initial round of ads critical of mccrory he has held his support steady and in fact closed the gap on perdue by 1 point
6660261 i had somebody transpose from one statement to the next
6660262 i assume it was an oversight there was never any intent

6660265 cambodia is fortunate to be making gains in healthcare education and political transparency though the country still has a long way to go in recovering since it was plunged into tumult by the brutal khmer rouge regime i dont believe that microfinance alone is by any means a panacea for development here in cambodia or anywhere else in the world however i have witnessed the substantial impact that microfinance has on enterprising motivated individuals completing the kind of work that kiva and hkl do provides the financial resources necessary for upward mobility to those who would otherwise lack these resources or at least pay dearly for them e g through village money lenders or informal lending circles many kiva hkl hattha kaksekar limited borrowers have been able to significantly improve their living conditions by expanding small businesses like grocery stalls food stands and personal farms to the level that would create consistent increased income ya fatimas of phnom penh city her loan of 1000 was used to expand her modest business of selling pumpkin cakes to local villagers and to purchase a motorcycle for her husband to use for taxi services in the city after receiving the loan she saw a substantial increase in her household income which enables her to pay school fees for her children without sacrificing other necessities hkl is a socially progressive profit driven organization which i have witnessed to work extremely efficiently throughout the country the organization operates successfully in nine provinces and has long term plans to expand to serve the entire country in light of hkls large footprint im continually impressed by the intimate geographical knowledge of the hkl distribution network local credit officers seem to understand so well the web of interaction between all of the inhabitants of their designated village or region and can therefore lend adequately to clients without approving over indebtedness hkl has been a partner with kiva since february 2008 and is committed to further strengthening its relationship with kiva look out for new hkl clients that are continually posted on kiva org

6660271 the dubai authorities have decided to give preference to european american and australian institutes
6660272 the local authorities are of the opinion that diac should have a global face and it will not be achieved if it is crowded with institutes from only one country that is why the authorities have put a limit on the number of institutes from india and decided to give preference to institutes from other countries

6660280 i would like to reassure paiges family that everything possible is being done to find paige and put an end to their year of misery
6660281 this is an ongoing investigation with a dedicated team of officers working around the clock
6660282 i am absolutely convinced that people in blackpool hold the clues that will lead us to her whereabouts and i am committed to finding her
6660283 as part of our review of the investigation we will be looking at the previous searches and it is our intention to continue to search further and if necessary search some areas again in order to leave no stone unturned in the search for clues as to the current whereabouts of paige
6660284 from day one we have and will continue to keep an open mind during this investigation and will rule northing in or out
6660285 as time goes on our concerns are naturally growing for her safety but someone somewhere knows where she is and both the police and her family need that person to come forward
6660286 the point was whether the governor was wrong and the official judgment is that he was

6660296 we need to stand and deliver if we dont deliver then some guys including myself should be replaced it is about performing in pressure situations and that is what we have to do it is as simple as that
6660297 last year we won the rugby world cup through a conservative plan based on kicking the ball and people said we were not playing a game that would bring people to watch rugby now we are running the ball and people are saying we are not winning
6660298 maybe you need a 50 50 split between the styles but at the end of day we want to win in the tri nations we have seen that the teams that kick best on the day win the games so tactically we have to be very good tomorrow
6660299 you need to keep structure for most of the game at least up until the three quarter mark and then hopefully you will have worn down the opposition enough for you to score easier tries
6660300 you cant just throw the ball around willy nilly we learned that in our final game against the lions in the super 14 where we needed a bonus point try to qualify but failed to get it because we did not stick to our structure and tried to run everything
6660301 the wallabies have some astute kickers and it is an area of our game that we need to improve
6660302 we have not been precise in what we do at the breakdowns
6660303 it is vital that we put in a collective effort it is about all 15 guys clearing out not just the loose forwards
6660304 it is about knowing when to commit yourself to a ruck and when to stay out if you want to score tries you need to keep the ball and ultimately you will only keep it if you have numbers to the breakdowns
6660305 we need to get into position quicker and that means keeping an eye on the flyhalf and pre empting what he is going to do it comes down to work rate and making the right decisions on the ball
6660306 the challenge is for each one of us to dominate his opposite number if that happens how can we lose

6660308 the perception that the president and the government are worried that any independent scrutiny of this rotten deal will reveal extensive wrongdoing
6660309 it is for this reason that the president most likely refuses to appoint an independent inquiry into the arms deal and why government continues to obstruct and prevent access to relevant documents by international investigation agencies
6660310 if there really are no irregularities then government should have no reason to prevent those documents from being scrutinised or for an open inquiry to take place
6660311 large scale irregularities and corruption associated with the arms deal

6660341 at times i think were seen as an easy target who can be picked on i suppose the presumption is that nobody will stick up for us and that were fair game
6660342 to begin with i didnt go to the police about some of these things it didnt occur to me there was any law against the name calling i didnt think i would get a sympathetic hearing from the police
6660343 a lot of my friends who are lesbian and gay told me of negative experiences that theyve had when they tried reporting crime there tends to be this negative idea in the community and it puts people off
6660344 they put some handfuls of potential flammable rubbish through the letterbox the local secondary school was burnt to the ground not very far from where were living and it made me very frightened at that time that we might be at risk of an arson attack
6660345 it was at that point that i involved the hate crime officers from that point on i felt as if the service we were receiving from the police improved enormously
6660346 the fire service came and assess the fire safety of the house and the police started to take us more seriously really and to pursue the culprits more effectively

6660365 the debtors continued willingness to operate a money losing business that burns cash for the benefit of gm is beyond comprehension
6660366 those three are big names right now but at the same time anybody can be beat it doesnt matter who it is i mean weve beat better pitchers than those guys but those guys kept their team in the game and we couldnt get many runs off them its tough to swallow
6660367 its not disneyland in here right now guys are disappointed and frustrated
6660368 we were facing very good pitching and they were going against a team that has not been putting enough quality at bats together to match up with that kind of pitching staff right now theyve been getting seven eight innings out of their starters and we scored six runs in the series you dont win very many series when you score six runs total
6660369 the middle of their lineup has a lot of power and you know theyre going to come out and swing so youve got to make some pitches and get ahead early and i was able to do that
6660370 i just tried to work on getting outs on the first couple of pitches which ive kind of gotten away from so far in my big league career
6660371 im not a me guy im just worried about us going out and winning ballgames
6660372 i thought i struck figgins out before that on a fastball in but i didnt get the call on the checked swing so i had to throw more pitches to him
6660373 sometimes when something like that happens unfortunately the next thing you know you give up a home run i guess after seeing so many pitches in a row he was able to time it but i was battling
6660374 it got me pretty square then i had to go toward first base but i had to get the out as bad as it hurt i just went after it and was able to make the play
6660375 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting out there and playing defense behind me the way they are
6660376 ive been able to get down in the zone low and get a lot of ground balls and strikeouts
6660377 the sinker had great action the changeup was really good tonight
6660378 it just has such action down below the hitting area out of the hand it looks like a good pitch to hit and you have to commit
6660379 it put a little length between us and l a
6660380 nows the time of year we start looking when we start following other teams and looking at the scoreboard we need to take care of business
6660381 pretty much from here on out its just so close were trying to win every game for the team if i clean up on decisions great but im just trying to go out and get deep into the game give us a chance to win
6660382 he gets more people to chase pitches down in the zone so you just have to be really patient and really selective at what you swing at
6660383 our politics have become so embedded and so partisan with so many special interests that they require a massive effort from the public telling them we want something done

6660390 he is an excellent scrummager an excellent player so well have to scrum really well to combat his strengths
6660391 as you saw in the game against the all blacks in cape town he scrummaged extremely well hes very powerful and very explosive as well and i think the new rules definitely suit him because hes got a lot of pace hes super fast i know that much hopefully i wont have to match up to him on the wing
6660392 they scrummed exceptionally and they seem to have improved their technique since the last time we played them
6660393 the all blacks are rated as one of the best scrums in the world but the bok scrum was really good the beast and cj van der linde look very good
6660394 we are a lot more technical and we do more work on our scrums with a full time scrum coach in michael foley
6660395 i think he has been good for me i couldnt have moved from loosehead to tighthead this year without his tutelage so i have a lot of respect for michael and i owe a great deal to him because hes helped me change sides which is not an easy task
6660396 it was a big change after the world cup i played mainly at loosehead up until the start of this years super 14 its a new challenge and its certainly a lot tougher come scrum time but its something im enjoying

6660449 i thought his velocitys getting back up to where it was
6660450 hes not there yet as compared with where he was when he was with us early in the year but thats to be expected because he hasnt been out there that many times he just looked crisp to me
6660451 suppose your construction firm has specific technology requirements and its important to choose a system that matches your needs with nearly 100 construction project management systems available it can be difficult to identify the right program for your business three top level features to look for include dynamic scheduling with automatic updates from daily reports and change orders job cost controls with reports to flag issues that impact the critical path and document management share project information with constituents and to enforce accountability
6660452 oh i really thought this was going to be a lifestyle film about north fork long island
6660453 i think its really really messing up my weekend thats about to come you know its flooding and we cant really get anywhere so its kind of inconvenient
6660454 any water coming down this way were still waiting on that were already filled to capacity down here
6660455 after the hurricanes last time they say sanctuary was flooded out lapping at peoples doors
6660456 we have so much water now all our roadside ditches are full
6660457 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6660458 they had reports of people going in and out of the house at night which they werent supposed to be
6660459 we went into the house to change the locks because it was undergoing foreclosure procedures
6660460 i had a cop tell me its the biggest thing hed seen in 19 years
6660461 it was an impressive amount of equipment they pulled out
6660462 as officers were dismantling the operation the residents of the house both arrived
6660463 he drove up and they had a police car down the cul de sac and blocked him in and that was the end of that
6660464 i was truthfully happy to see it happen and get this sick place cleaned up
6660465 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6660466 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6660467 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6660468 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6660469 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6660470 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6660471 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6660472 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6660473 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6660474 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6660475 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6660476 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6660477 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6660478 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6660479 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6660480 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

6660482 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6660483 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6660484 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6660485 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6660486 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6660487 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6660488 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6660489 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6660490 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6660491 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6660492 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6660493 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6660494 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6660495 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6660496 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6660497 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6660498 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6660499 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6660500 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6660501 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6660502 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6660503 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6660504 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6660505 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6660506 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6660507 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6660508 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6660509 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6660510 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6660511 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6660512 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6660513 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6660514 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6660515 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6660516 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6660517 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6660518 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6660519 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6660520 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6660521 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6660522 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6660523 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6660524 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6660525 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6660526 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6660527 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6660528 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6660529 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6660530 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6660531 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6660532 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6660533 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6660534 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6660535 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6660536 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6660537 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6660538 i had to look it up on wikipedia because i dont know what it is
6660539 who do people say that the son of man is
6660540 look the israelite people are more numerous and more powerful than we come let us deal shrewdly with them or they will increase and in the event of war join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land
6660541 when you act as midwives to the hebrew women and see them on the birthstool if it is a boy kill him but if it is a girl she shall live
6660542 why have you done this and allowed the boys to live
6660543 because the hebrew women are not like the egyptian women for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them
6660544 every boy that is born to the hebrews you shall throw into the nile but you shall let every girl live
6660545 shall i go and get you a nurse from the hebrew women to nurse the child for you
6660546 take this child and nurse it for me and i will give you your wages
6660547 who do people say that the son of man is
6660548 some say john the baptist but others elijah and still others jeremiah or one of the prophets
6660549 you couldnt get away from that frog that attacked you with a sword and magic wand so you have to re do your last three hours of work
6660550 thats all i seem to do now i have to work to keep you alive to feed you i havent smiled once since you were born go the sleep
6660551 they dont really mean it when they tell me to get kidnapped
6660552 how many more like you are there how many more you cant even imagine the things ive endured and always at the hands of shit like you
6660553 two nights ago i was taking a walk at night and this little chihuahua started following me goddammit it knew i ran and finally lost it and made it home but it knew it knewwww
6660554 im sure that if you searched into the lives of some of these victims you would find out that they themselves were the cause of their very death
6660555 any pile of stunted growth unaware that entertainment is just that and nothing more deserves to doom themselves to some dark cell somewhere for having been so stupid movies books tv music theyre all just entertainment not guidbooks for damning yourself
6660556 i never drank her blood never but i needed it
6660557 hey so she said wacky so what i mean just look at you
6660558 trust me i know what self loathing is but to kill myself that would put a damper on my search for answers not at all productive
6660559 in these moments you can tell theyre not regretting having hurt you they regret doing it to your face
6660560 you must really know me if you can laugh at me funny thing is ive never met you before maybe you can let me in out what you thought was so funny
6660561 the world would be so much nicer if people only used guns on themselves
6660562 you bitch about equal treatment as a human being but you and your friends laugh at me for the way i look
6660563 why is it whenever were no talking about being discriminated by people for the way we look other people i mean what makes you any different from those jock holes who were laughing at your hair that one time
6660564 if we talked about anything else we might expose the fact that most of our arrogance is based on exploiting a fashionable alienation rather than anything substantial
6660565 so if i must live i would prefer to enjoy it rather than waste my time figuring out a way to end it all
6660566 i was enchanted by the world of rock music the singers could scream of good and evil proclaim themselves angels or devils and mortals would stand up and cheer
6660567 i knew i was probably going to die but it never occured to me to give up
6660568 i dont think you can have a healthy real relationship until you fix things with him
6660569 oh it should be easy to move on i mean it was just a silly crush and they just stopped talking
6660570 get away from me satan you are a dangerous trap to me you are seeing things merely from a human point of view and not from gods
6660571 the president will definitely not remove anyone who has shown promise
6660572 you may say one year is too short to assess a minister but within that period you can see those who know what they are doing and those who are just making up the numbers
6660573 these are the minister of finance dr shamsudeen usman minister of fct dr aliyu moddibo umar and the former minister of health professor adenike grange
6660574 in fact obasanjo handpicked all the nominees from the south west and most of the nominees from other geo political zones that is why yaradua allowed them to be but now he is looking for his own ministers whom he can vouch for in terms of competence and performance
6660575 it was while they were with the minister from about noon to 4 p m waiting for the briefing that the minister got the green light from the villa to brief them on mr presidents decision which in some ways was a shock to them
6660576 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6660577 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6660578 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6660579 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6660580 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6660581 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6660582 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6660583 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6660584 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6660585 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6660586 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6660587 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6660588 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6660589 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6660590 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6660591 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6660592 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6660593 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6660594 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6660595 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6660596 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6660597 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6660598 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
6660599 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
6660600 det er jo ikke vores andres fejl hvis der er befolkningsgrupper der ikke har kommet sig over neanderthal niveauet
6660601 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6660602 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6660603 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6660604 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6660605 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6660606 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6660607 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6660608 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6660609 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6660610 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6660611 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6660612 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6660613 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6660614 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6660615 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
6660616 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6660617 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6660618 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6660619 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6660620 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6660621 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6660622 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6660623 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6660624 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6660625 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6660626 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6660627 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6660628 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6660629 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6660630 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6660631 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6660635 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6660636 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6660637 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6660638 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6660639 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6660640 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6660641 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6660642 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6660643 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6660644 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6660645 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6660646 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6660647 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6660648 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6660649 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6660650 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6660651 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6660652 equity market is down and companies in asia based in singapore are looking to countries like china and india and launching agri funds to tap the asian potential
6660653 i am always filled with commodities i am passionate about commodities
6660654 you know commodity is a thing of reality i love realities
6660655 one third of singapore is farm land there are several hectares of organic farming there
6660656 i am half indian and half chinese that is why i have this strange name singh lim
6660657 most other olympics acquired their label during or after the games usually after emotions had coalesced or a big news event pushed other stories off the front page but the combination of fascination with china and increasingly intense churn of media attention has changed that
6660658 this decision to subsidize imported edible oil including palm oil is a mortal blow to millions of coconut farmers the state registers its strong protest at the centre for taking the decision
6660659 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6660660 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

6660663 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6660664 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6660665 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6660666 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6660667 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6660668 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6660669 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6660670 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6660671 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6660672 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6660673 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6660674 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6660675 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

6660678 after meeting personally today with attorney general andrew cuomo and north american securities administrators association president karen tyler i am pleased to report that we have reached an amicable resolution and global settlement of this matter

6660680 we have been working on behalf of our clients since this liquidity problem began
6660681 we will continue to work actively across the industry as well as with our financial advisors to ensure that we continue to serve our clients well
6660682 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6660683 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6660684 all around the gate i saw blood and human flesh people helped the injured and took them in their cars and even on motorbikes to the hospital
6660685 seven or eight people were already dead and another 10 people were breathing their last
6660686 only innocent people die when the pakistan army carries out airstrikes in bajur or swat
6660687 if the army is really fond of fighting it should send ground forces to see how we fight
6660688 there are no quick fixes but a liberal government will take these significant innovative and sensible steps that will finally have our health system heading in the right direction
6660689 in 2001 labor promised to fix the health system and the reverse has happened we will provide stronger investment and a new ways of working to achieve better hospitals better surgeries better emergency services and better treatment across the board
6660690 we will keep the commitment to the retention and recruitment of nurses made by labor yesterday labor funding and the initiatives
6660691 a liberal government will have a full time health and indigenous affairs minister giving the sector the attention it deserves
6660692 a liberal government will revolutionise the surgery waiting list with an injection of 30 million to perform an extra 8 000 surgeries publication of accurate wait list figures by hospital and the appointment of a waiting list advocate on to act on behalf of patients who wait longer than they should be for their surgery
6660693 western australia has the worst access block that is the highest percentage of people waiting more than eight hours for emergency treatment in australia
6660694 our initiatives will directly address that and a liberal government will ease the pressure on our emergency departments
6660695 its time for a new way forward in health in wa a liberal government will address the immediate crisis our part time labor health minister has plunged our health system into and pave the way for a better way forward
6660696 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6660697 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6660698 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6660699 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6660700 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6660701 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6660702 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6660703 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6660704 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6660705 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6660706 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6660707 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6660708 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6660709 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6660710 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6660711 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6660712 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6660713 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6660714 he had no idea until sunday he had any problem nor did we or anyone else
6660715 his family and i were the only ones who knew gene had a very aggressive form of pancreatic cancer
6660716 i think gene is one of the most pivotal people in the history of the nfl
6660717 players past and present had no better friend than gene upshaw with time people will come to fully understand and appreciate his contributions and his legacy it was genes strength and conviction that got the players to where they are today
6660718 i would say no life is easily reduced to one issue and we had our issues and hes caused some suffering but theres still some humanity and our hearts and prayers go out to his family
6660719 upshaw was an easy target but the problem was bigger than him it is the institution itself and the commissioner he would be the pi ata and take the beating and make it seem that one man was taking the shots but the problem is more than just him
6660720 a lot of people forget theres no such thing as unanimous support in any body you represent but from a results standpoint what more could you want the retired players some of them are getting four times what they would have gotten if gene hadnt been there the stuff about being too close to tagliabue id like to have anyone explain to me how the players havent been served by gene the owners just opted out of this labor deal because it was such a bad deal for them and such a good deal for the players
6660721 separate statements are required not to satisfy a sadistic urge to torment lawyers but rather to afford due process to opposing parties and to permit trial courts to expeditiously review complex motions for summary judgment to determine quickly and efficiently whether material facts are disputed
6660722 the investigation commission is working very intensively and hand in hand with foreign experts
6660723 they now seem to have usurped the moral leadership of the region
6660724 i convey my sadness to my counterparts of the island countries of the forum of the emerging and threatening dominance of the forum by the two developed metropolitan powers australia and new zealand
6660725 you all are aware of the high level public posturing by the leaders of the two countries both days before the forum meeting and after they learnt that fiji will not be in the niue meeting
6660726 the pacific island countries will need to be vigilant to protect the forum organisation becoming a foreign policy tool of these two countries
6660727 we may have to paddle our canoes on our own
6660728 to be bullied and pressured into doing things that are clearly not in our national interest
6660729 if we succumb to such pressures what next what will that do to our self worth as an independent nation
6660730 however we were compelled to refrain from traveling to niue because of one reason alone the action taken by the new zealand government to exclude fiji from the post forum consultations
6660731 mark is currently part of gatehouse medias executive management team and is well versed in all aspects of our business

6660735 to have sex i just woke up with the biggest hard on ive ever had in my life
6660736 after recently being asked by the england management to reassess my retirement from international one day cricket ive decided to join englands squad for the natwest series after careful consideration
6660737 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6660738 i decided to retire from englands odi team for a number reasons one being the amount of time i was spending away from my family
6660739 now that my family is settled and my bowling is settled i feel i have something to offer englands odi side and am looking forward to playing a part in the natwest series against south africa
6660740 having missed out on selection at various times this year i am well aware of the disappointment that comes from not being a part of the england dressing room
6660741 with that in mind i want to be a part of the team and if that means bringing myself out of retirement to play a role in this upcoming natwest series then im happy to do just that
6660742 we can confirm that mr gadd has left bangkok and is heading to the uk
6660743 thailand is not allowing him to enter the country and hong kong is turning him back so there is no choice for him now

6660745 its a pretty different team to the test side and a lot of lads have come in wanting to impress and cement spots within the side so theres a freshness about the squad
6660746 kevin has obviously taken over as captain and everyone is eager to impress england for a long time now have under performed in one day cricket and weve got a chance to address that now and hopefully put some performances in
6660747 we got to the world cup final in 1992 and since then weve never been consistent
6660748 were definitely aware of that but we cant let it lie too heavily on us weve got to go out there and perform and were well aware of that but weve got to do it consistently
6660749 theyre the form side theyve beaten everyone theyve come up against
6660750 they are a formidable team in one day internationals and its going to be tough for us but weve got to test ourselves against these sides
6660751 weve beaten the best sides in the world before but weve got to beat them over a period of time and not just in one off games

6660755 the markets had sort of assumed that this would all be over reasonably soon
6660756 we continue to believe that inflationary pressures will be on the upside with inflation likely to peak at 13
6660757 we expect the central bank to tighten monetary policy further

6660771 our movement has been too silent on afghanistan and ufpj must take leadership to expose the horrors and costs of this engagement
6660772 should the peace movement support u s military forces in a policing role rather than counter insurgency role
6660773 was a military invasion of afghanistan an appropriate reaction to the september 11 attacks
6660774 located in p tion ville haiti sopudep school is a comprehensive public school serving the poorest residents of the city founded in 2002 the school has grown to over 400 students many of who receive their only regular meal through the schools hot lunch program
6660775 to post signs for her new project in the building and hold a press conference
6660776 sopudep school and the staff are a shining light for the children of haiti with nothing more than their own determination they have built a school that provides an unbelievable service to children that would otherwise have no means of obtaining any kind of education
6660777 it greatly disturbs me that such a success story in haiti should be under attack i have never met people more committed to doing what is right for the children of the community than the staff at sopudep school
6660778 the economic reality of haiti is such that a large proportion of children are inadequately nourished and unable to concentrate while in school i have seen the glazed look of hungry children in haitis schools sopudep has responded to this reality by instituting a feeding program guaranteeing hundreds of children one square meal every day of the week so they can focus on their studies
6660779 by closing sopudep school the mayor of p tion ville is clearly showing a complete lack of concern for the health and future of her communitys most vulnerable members
6660780 you will always have problems but when you are starting a business you will have problems that you have no idea what to do with it takes researching options and a qualified support team to make the right decision keep going the confidence will come with practice
6660781 theres so much i dont know what do i do if i run into a situation where i dont know the answer or dont know how to do something
6660782 not if when you will run into those situations a lot surround yourself with the best people you can and draw on their expertise youll still run into those situations in those cases do the best you can and fake it till you make it

6660802 were both working hard to try to make that happen
6660803 whether its an onside kick a kickoff a short field goal an extra point whoever gives us the best chance to make that work thats whos going to be in the game
6660804 because each one of them has something now that they do well
6660805 the one thing that no one can answer is how they will react when there are 65 000 people in the stands and mom and dad are there and if they miss the kick we lose the game

6660813 es el punto de unificaci n en dos contextos diferentes en el documental llevamos a la audiencia en una expedici n oceanogr fica paso por paso es un viaje a ultramar y hay que prepararse psicol gica f sica y tecnol gicamente durante la inmersi n sientes aprensi n y claustrofobia navegas despu s por el fondo del mar hasta dar con el titanic la imagen es familiar pero de buenas a primeras te das cuenta de que est s en un lugar extremadamente remoto menos gente ha bajado hasta el titanic que subido a la cumbre del everest o viajado al espacio es un escenario remoto y ex tico a la vez
6660814 bill representa todos nuestros miedos me encantan las expediciones marinas y aunque me mareo en alta mar me fuerzo a m mismo porque las recompensas son mayores
6660815 te ricamente se pueden rescatar pero yo no lo har a mejor dejarlas tal cual tiene m s fuerza saber que la vidrieras siguen en su sitio original que verlas expuestas en un museo la proa asom ndose entre las tinieblas posee un poder que se perder a de cortarla en piezas y subirla a la superficie es el emplazamiento correcto y las im genes del barco en el fondo del mar funcionan mejor en la conciencia e imaginaci n del p blico el titanic tiene una fuerza propia como monumento conmemorativo

6660862 the selenia digital mammography unit is the latest generation in digital mammography technology
6660863 by using a newly approved x ray tube our unit enables a nearly 35 percent reduction in radiation exposure
6660864 we waited to purchase this particular model to ensure that we could offer our patients this important feature
6660865 the image quality that we get with this new unit is amazing
6660866 because of the higher contrast were able to see smaller details with much greater accuracy
6660867 patients are very relieved that they dont have to wait for the image our mammographers are able to review the images while the patient is in the examination room and make decisions about the need for additional images
6660868 but applying this to our digital images should result in even higher performance
6660869 our patients tell us that the mammopads increases their comfort greatly
6660870 recent evidence tells us that there has been a decline in the breast cancer mortality since screening mammography began this is evidence that screening mammography saves lives

6660897 the silk road between asia and the middle east was until the 13th century among the worlds most important trade routes trade and investment are once again flowing between these regions after 700 years now its up to governments in both asia and the middle east to create a more hospitable investment climate that will allow this new silk road to achieve its potential
6660898 many important scientific and technological innovations migrated along the silk road to the west transfer of these innovations including gunpowder the magnetic compass the printing press silk mathematics ceramic and lacquer crafts was gradual so that the west had no clear idea as to their origins
6660899 in the five years to 2010 asia is likely to require about 1 trillion of foreign direct investment and china alone will consume more than half of that total meanwhile with oil prices riding high investors and companies in the gulf states have money to invest

6660907 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
6660908 this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform

6660925 my administration has been calling upon all the leaders in the in the middle east to do everything they can to stop the violence to tell the different parties involved that peace will never happen

6660938 we steam bake fry and grill our seafood platter is one of our top sellers it comes with a variety of large shrimp oysters stuffed crab and fish but our best selling item is our famous bahama bob burger
6660939 since we are located on the beach its a good lunch stop and this burger makes for a terrific lunch
6660940 and the food is wonderful we had the shrimp salad po boy and the fish of the day sandwich both were terrific
6660941 we open at 11 a m and close when the last guest wants to leave
6660942 we are the little place with the best atmosphere around

6660944 sam tries to focus on lindsay but its never enough
6660945 there was a deluge of rain and that incorporated with the high tide produced severe flooding
6660946 for me education was a complete commitment never just a job always a calling teachers must be in love with teaching
6660947 at some point the idea of a private school was enticing
6660948 things had gotten so impersonal in public schools especially for the parents i wanted a school where parents could call me their childs teacher and get an answer or see me the day they needed to
6660949 the questions on the fcat have nothing to do with beauty
6660950 i felt like public education was on the wrong path too many politics too little endearing interests in the liberal arts
6660951 i am entrusted to teach these students how to learn they have to learn the tools of learning how to learn they develop a center then they branch out and gain confidence they learn to trust themselves
6660952 there was so much emphasis on teaching material that we would need later and i wanted to learn stuff that was applicable to me now
6660953 he makes people excited about learning because hes excited about teaching i admire that he hasnt quit yet hes taken hold of what he loves and hes not going to let it go
6660954 i knew i belonged right here my dad is so devoted its such an enriching process to watch him work to see kids turn around enjoy school and start to believe in themselves it prepares them for maturity to make better choices more intellectual decisions based on what theyve learned about themselves
6660955 both girls have benefited from the one on one time with teachers they help identify a students strengths as well as their struggles
6660956 im happy because theyre happy and theyre doing really well thats the bottom line
6660957 she devoted her life to helping my dad fulfill his dream none of this would have been possible without her she was the wind beneath his wings
6660958 i qualified last september but it hasnt really hit me until now
6660959 with the start of the olympics you realise just how big and important it all is and how lucky you are because not many get to go out and represent their country its a real honour and an amazing experience i want to go out there and score goals
6660960 i felt very sorry for myself and tried to work for the next couple of years but it was getting harder
6660961 i bumbled through and started teaching again it was then i met my future wife joanna through coaching netball
6660962 i did recover after intensive dialysis treatment and i convalesced for seven months having to learn to walk again
6660963 eventually i went back to work but i struggled to gain constant employment in the end i felt this was not practical for me in my position due to the limitations of my eye condition
6660964 our research tells us the governments plans would have significant and unintended consequences for business we dont believe the government intended to design a scheme to achieve the outcome of businesses and jobs moving offshore but that would be the outcome of the governments plans
6660965 we want to ensure that industry plays its part but that the cost is kept at a level which allows them to stay in australia rather than move to a less demanding jurisdiction
6660966 at the end of the day weve got to understand there is not a bottomless pit of money here
6660967 serious questions need to be raised why the government should transfer billions of dollars of taxpayers revenue to businesses who have known an emissions trading scheme was coming over a decade ago
6660968 polluting industries that have spent the last decade doing little or nothing to prepare for a carbon constrained economy should not get a free kick
6660969 leaves too much scope for uncertainty for business to continue to invest in existing and new facilities
6660970 will be unlikely to invest while such outcomes are possible
6660971 queenslands economy is booming its appetite for electricity is growing faster than any other state in australia
6660972 its going to have to make decisions earlier than other states in terms of what the next generation of power plants are going to be
6660973 given 90 per cent of electricity comes from fossil fuel and in the future we cant use fossil fuels at least not to the same extent the creation of this group to stimulate an objective debate about nuclear power makes a lot of sense
6660974 nuclear energy has been going for 50 years but not many people know much about it
6660975 the idea is to be an education forum to help educate people on the pros and cons of nuclear energy
6660976 there is no logic i can see for queensland to not develop uranium reserves
6660977 rigorous and credible process for identifying the states most excellent teachers
6660978 if teachers want to link higher level skills and professional recognition to higher pay then we would readily examine that as part of our wages negotiations
6660979 the rudd government has also indicated it is interested in developing proposals to reward higher level teaching and wed welcome input by the commonwealth in this debate
6660980 we are simply concerned that the best teachers be recognised
6660981 the key to this system is that we actually identify the best teachers our emphasis is that the process is credible to both teachers and the community
6660982 we would like to be involved in investigating and discussing the idea of higher levels of accreditation as something that could be recognised by additional pay
6660983 it is critical for the government to put new money in for this because if there is no new money some teachers will be paid extra at the expense of others
6660984 it is like being in any kind of professional organisation
6660985 we have clearly stated that it is contingent on funding and the funding is not there
6660986 if you do it again ya little black arsehole youre goin t be in the f amp n river
6660987 jesus christ he even pissed himself you f n dirty little animal
6660988 but it has been recognised for its artistic excellence and the brilliance of the story and we are an awards for literary merit
6660989 we live in a less than perfect world and authors illustrators and publishers are perhaps reflecting our society
6660990 books provide a means of generating thoughtful discussions about issues and fears
6660991 sam tries to focus on lindsay but its never enough
6660992 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
6660993 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
6660994 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
6660995 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
6660996 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
6660997 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
6660998 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
6660999 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
6661000 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
6661001 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
6661002 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
6661003 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
6661004 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
6661005 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
6661006 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
6661007 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
6661008 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
6661009 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
6661010 we are optimistic it is going to go through without further delay but you never know
6661011 if its approved we are going to go out and borrow 300 million and buy a hospital
6661012 we feel by closing one of pensacolas three emergency rooms it is going to create a real crisis
6661013 scare tactic to try and influence the attorney general to force us to keep a free standing emergency room at that campus
6661014 baptist handles about 60 000 emergency room visits a year downtown
6661015 what we are saying is that it is conceivable 30 000 of them could wind up over here in an emergency room that is already stretched to capacity
6661016 will a couple thousand more patients wind up going to sacred heart because it is more convenient
6661017 yeah they will get a few more patients but they can afford a few more patients
6661018 it happens every time i get new batting gloves it just flies out of there

6661022 we stand on a great divide in the detection and study of exoplanets
6661023 i doubt it this is why id rather not try
6661024 its nice of you to care enough to guilt trip me but werent you trying to put something on your stomach so the pain pills would work better
6661025 i thought youd want to wash that down with it

6661027 so i guess this one goes out to satan lets hope he offers health benefits
6661028 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6661029 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6661030 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6661031 if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6661032 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6661033 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6661034 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6661035 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6661036 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here

6661050 most people dont have the luxury of living to be 80 years old
6661051 so its hard for me to feel sorry for them
6661052 i dont know why we like to put cows on the roof but i kinda like it

6661060 the time to begin writing an article is when you have finished it to your satisfaction by that time you begin to clearly and logically perceive what it is that you really want to say
6661061 schwartz will not comment on dubois even to defend himself preferring to talk only about his experiments
6661062 i personally never read the article all though many of my friends did and they asked me to not read it because it wasnt true i feel sooo loved and protected by those who see me clearly
6661063 i will be ready but i dont know about playing in the preseason
6661064 we will have to wait and see its always making progress every day i come out here its getting better
6661065 i know it aint exactly running but running in the pool is great conditioning
6661066 the ncaa has graciously agreed to tak e another look at this case
6661067 thats not the way we perceive being a champion rogge said
6661068 i have no problem with him doing a show i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6661069 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you cant do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6661070 i assume they think the kids were very natural looking and nice
6661071 fifty six children from 56 chinese ethnic groups cluster around the chinese national flag representing the 56 ethnic groups
6661072 i would argue it is normal for dancers performers to be dressed in other races clothes
6661073 id be at their lockers all the time asking can we get some snaps
6661074 the center quarterback exchange weve got to get that solidified and you have to get used to every quarterback theres a different place i have to put the ball it seems for every quarterback
6661075 we want a guy that when they line up a nose guard on us he can hold his own
6661076 i remember looking back at antron last year and i could count on one hand the times he came out of the game
6661077 you want that center to stay in the game because you want that quarterback center cohesion hes the one seeing the linebacker stances and d line stances all game long
6661078 if you think about it from last years offensive line we lost four starters
6661079 then you take a guy like ricky and move him around i think that there needs to be a cohesiveness and it just takes some time takes some reps takes lining up and playing with each other
6661080 ideally if he could come back next week and have a full week of practice thatd be great
6661081 more so than the mental part its the physical part running getting hit he knows what to do
6661082 we have delivered the biggest modernization of the atp tour
6661083 i believe we have delivered the biggest modernization of the atp tour since its inception have attracted unprecedented levels of investment into mens tennis and have begun to feed the growing appetite for mens tennis globally both in established and emerging markets
6661084 i am honored to have played a part in taking our great sport to the next level
6661085 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today
6661086 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive
6661087 just had a pretty good read on it so i had nothing to lose
6661088 girl he just came in let me go tell him about his damn self and ill call you tomorrow alright girl bye
6661089 how in the hell did you let all them damn people catch you slippin at saddleback
6661090 you bring your ass in here one minute past twelve and i got something for you
6661091 just got through telling your girlfriend you know the one that you tell everything much to your husbands chagrin how you had a feeling this shit was going to happen
6661092 if im having success doing it one way theres no reason to really change so i think its just the same mentality in the eighth and ninth
6661093 ill play it game by game and situation by situation
6661094 eighth inning and ninth inning its the same idea its just that the ninth inning is the last one hopefully
6661095 i think its going to be good for me to go down there get a couple of a starts and hopefully gain some momentum for the rest of the year

6661100 being a better submissive means learning to trust your dominant to punish you when you need it and not do it to yourself
6661101 i shouldnt hold my punishments up to my measuring stick that decision is solely masters as to how much he thinks i should be punished
6661102 the words were there on my tongue but i couldnt do it

6661104 intimacy while she spanks me and while she hugs me after
6661105 there is a whole other mindset going on when he is being punished for bad behavior it is very easy to turn him back to a little boy in a matter of minutes and believe me there is nothing erotic about it
6661106 see it doesnt exist so i dont need to look for it
6661107 loving is not something that you feel it is something that you do
6661108 love is not a feeling its an act of your will
6661109 i dont care how steep your steeple is when its sittin on a cemetary

6661111 when you get home you are to change into your plaid skirt and a white shirt and wait for me
6661112 for real as a naughty girl who got sent home from school
6661113 i wondered about that youre going to be punished for that too
6661114 your punishment for going out without a cell phone is going to be much harder than this
6661115 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6661116 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6661117 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6661118 if an imbalance of power based on centuries of socialization is bubbling just below the surface of a relationship some couples deal with the conflict by establishing some boundaries and choosing to accept then
6661119 most women are the boss of their marriage the only difference is that ive admitted it and she has acknowledged it
6661120 taken at face value domestic discipline reeks of feminist backlash
6661121 theres nothing feminist about sublimating your desires because society says you shouldnt have them
6661122 for dd women theres no readily apparent thread connecting actual childhood discipline with their current lifestyle
6661123 t he line between spanking intended for a boudoir thrill and spanking as an outside the bedroom consequence can be blurry
6661124 their fallibility frustrates and overwhelms them many american women strongly feel the drive to be perfect to be educated to be a breadwinner to be a good mother to be a good wife and to be beautiful to boot is it possible some women whether kinkily inclined formerly abused neither or both turn to domestic discipline the same way others find solace in punishing behaviors like eating disorders cutting or obsessively working out
6661125 mija and natty control the nature of their dd relationships with a power referred to in the bdsm community as topping from the bottom in such situations its the submissive partner whos actually in control the top is required to have permission from the bottom before inflicting any bdsm action
6661126 theoretically a man can be the submissive in a heterosexual domestic discipline relationship and a dd relationship can be same sex but based on both internet presence and the couples that i interviewed its far more common to find heterosexual female submissive practitioners
6661127 is it true that societal forces make it more likely that a woman will consent to spanking than a man
6661128 the crux of domestic discipline is that womens behavior is inherently rife with transgressions and the discipline provided by their intimate partner will be a leveling force
6661129 while trying to address the question that many non kinksters have regarding the relationship between childhood abuse and spanking wakeman makes it clear that
6661130 a spring like day that ended up with a spanking
6661131 a lot of people really like the idea of not having any say in what punishment they receive
6661132 a sense of calm a sense of security and of being cared for
6661133 punishment is the symbol of real submission of course if you do something intentionally to get punished then you are not getting your punishment because it is what the dominant wants in fact to the degree that you are manipulating them you are doing the opposite of obeying causing them to do what you want
6661134 help to build on the existing levels of the womans obedience respect and honesty
6661135 i decide that theres some sort of goal i want to achieve and he enforces it
6661136 the actual truth is as easy to find and is so much more rich and interesting to consider
6661137 its not just something neighbors feel strongly about its something we feel strongly about
6661138 it does bring a lot of noise and a lot of traffic to the neighborhood
6661139 ive seen smoke billowing out of a vent in the back of the bar and ive called 911 at least twice
6661140 theyre the ones who live in the neighborhoods and experience the problems because they live immediately next door to an establishment that generates noise or other livability issues
6661141 i think its a great idea theres a feedback mechanism
6661142 even though the city solicits information its apparent it doesnt really do much to anybody
6661143 i feel it keeps you honest and keeps you working hard to be a part of the community and i think thats a good thing
6661144 my philosophy is simple i like the world of music and there i think global because you have to let

6661174 it got me pretty square then i had to go toward first base but i had to get the out as bad as it hurt i just went after it and was able to make the play
6661175 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting out there and playing defense behind me the way they are
6661176 ive been able to get down in the zone low and get a lot of ground balls and strikeouts
6661177 the sinker had great action the changeup was really good tonight
6661178 it just has such action down below the hitting area out of the hand it looks like a good pitch to hit and you have to commit
6661179 it put a little length between us and l a
6661180 nows the time of year we start looking when we start following other teams and looking at the scoreboard we need to take care of business

6661182 he gets more people to chase pitches down in the zone so you just have to be really patient and really selective at what you swing at

6661224 instead of self serving schemes arroyo should address the present economic crisis burdening the people last we checked oil prices are still at record high levels the lines at nfa retail shops are not getting any shorter and the government is earning more windfalls via the vat at the expense of our poor countrymen

6661226 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6661227 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6661228 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6661229 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6661230 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6661231 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6661232 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6661233 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6661234 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6661235 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6661236 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6661237 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6661238 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6661239 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6661240 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6661241 the more carbs and sugars you eat the more your appetite control cells are damaged and potentially you consume more
6661242 people in the age group of 25 to 50 are most at risk the neurons that tell people in the crucial age range not to over eat are being killed off
6661243 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
6661244 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate overtime affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied
6661245 a diet rich in carbohydrate and sugar that has become more and more prevalent in modern societies over the last 20 30 years has placed so much strain on our bodies that its leading to premature cell deterioration
6661246 when a man receives hormone therapy initially the treatment works well and his psa prostate specific antigen level goes down
6661247 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is usually the first sign that the treatment is beginning to fail its a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
6661248 the androgen receptor acts differently in different cells in prostate tissue
6661249 its always been assumed that blocking the androgen receptor will stop all prostate cells from growing but we have found that thats not the case since current treatment acts non specifically on all the cells having androgen receptors in the prostate blocking the androgen receptor will give mixed results
6661250 while the androgen receptor is really driving prostate cancer in another sense it appears that the receptor also normally inhibits the spread of cancer cells it seems to have a dual role manipulating the androgen receptor can increase or decrease either of these actions depending on precisely how its done
6661251 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
6661252 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when its very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location
6661253 we found that the same is true within the cells of the prostate itself
6661254 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6661255 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6661256 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6661257 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6661258 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6661259 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6661260 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6661261 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6661262 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6661263 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6661264 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6661265 political opinion which includes the lack of a particular political opinion or any political opinion
6661266 escrts are like the recycling units of the cell they oversee the constant intake break down and replenishing of junctions on the cell surface
6661267 in a cancer cell where escrts are damaged the junctions may not be restored properly this can cause cells to separate and migrate to form secondary tumours in other parts of the body
6661268 previous studies have shown a link between escrts and the loss of junctions in cells of fruit flies so we want to see whether this is also true in humans
6661269 reactive oxygen species lead to oxidative stress in the body which can also cause dna damage we were able to gather clear evidence of a short term increase in certain indicators for oxidative stress during the competition and have already published these results however now we were also able to demonstrate that despite this increase no notable and persistent damage was caused to the athletes dna this is a surprising result which initially appears to contradict the data gathered in similar studies
6661270 the comparable studies analysed different biomarkers for predominantly short lived dna damage our study focused primarily on damage to dna that was subsequently evident in daughter cells following cell division and could therefore be of long term detriment to the body however we can sound the all clear in this respect our study clearly shows that in this case extreme competitive sport did not result in any increase in dna damage

6661277 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6661278 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6661279 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6661280 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community

6661282 id rather vote for the devil i know than the devil i dont know
6661283 were trying to get the nerve tissue to integrate with a device to grow into it to form a better connection
6661284 to get long term release we think these multi component systems are the way to go
6661285 we can control the release by combining the materials in different ways and were confident that we can extend the release time further even to 90 days
6661286 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6661287 its quite natural that when you spend more time in a room youre going to want it to be pleasing to the eye and functional even if that room is the bathroom when youre talking about creating a bathroom home spa thats even more important thats why homeowners should take a step back and consider their options when planning a dream bathroom
6661288 while most people dont create their dream bathroom for their homes next owner it certainly is a nice extra to know it can dramatically improve the value of the entire home
6661289 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6661290 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6661291 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6661292 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6661293 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6661294 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6661295 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6661296 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6661297 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6661298 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6661299 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6661300 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6661301 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6661302 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6661303 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6661304 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6661305 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6661306 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6661307 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6661308 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6661309 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6661310 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6661311 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

6661313 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6661314 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6661315 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6661316 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6661317 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6661318 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6661319 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6661320 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6661321 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6661322 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6661323 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6661324 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6661325 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6661326 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6661327 mccain cant keep track and referred inquiring reporters to his staff
6661328 economic problems that will make this years financial turbulence look like a trip to the debt counselors office
6661329 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6661330 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6661331 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6661332 meantime through jewish members of the russian secret police minutes of the proceedings of the basel congress in 1897 had been obtained and these were found to correspond with the protocols
6661333 these protocols were secretly extracted from a whole bookful of protocols all this was got by my correspondent out of the secret depositories of the head chancellory of zion this chancellory is at present on french territory
6661334 in our day all the governments of the entire world are consciously or unconsciously submissive to the commands of this great super government of zion because all the bonds and securities are in its hands for all countries are indebted to the jews for sums which they will never be able to pay all affairs industry commerce and diplomacy are in the hands of zion it is by means of its capital loans that it has enslaved all nations by keeping education on purely materialistic lines the jews have loaded the gentiles with heavy chains with which they have harnessed them to their supergovernment
6661335 the end of national liberty is near therefore personal freedom is approaching its close for true liberty cannot exist where zion uses the lever of its gold to rule the masses and dominate the most respectable and enlightened class of society
6661336 it is nearly four years since the protocols of the elders of zion came into my possession only god knows what efforts i have made to bring them to general notice in vain and even to warn those in power by disclosing the causes of the storm about to break on apathetic russia who seems in her misfortune to have lost all notion of what is going on around her
6661337 and it is only now when i fear it may be too late that i have succeeded in publishing my work hoping to put on their guard those who still have ears to hear and eyes to see
6661338 one can no longer doubt it the triumphant reign of the king of israel rises over our degenerate world as that of satan with his power and his terrors the king born of the blood of zion the antichrist is about to mount the throne of universal empire
6661339 events are precipitated in the world at a terrifying speed quarrels war rumours famines epidemics earthquakes everything which even yesterday was impossible today is an accomplished fact one would think that the days pass so rapidly to advance the cause of the chosen people space does not allow us to enter into the details of world history with regard to the disclosed mystery of iniquity to prove from history the influence which the wise men of zion have exercised through universal misfortunes by foretelling the certain and already near future of humanity or by raising the curtain for the last act of the worlds tragedy
6661340 only the light of christ and of his holy church universal can fathom the abyss of satan and disclose the extent of its wickedness
6661341 i feel in my heart that the hour has already struck when there should urgently be convoked an eighth oecumenical council which would unite the pastors and representatives of all christendom secular quarrels and schisms would all be forgotten in the imminent need of preparing against the coming of the antichrist
6661342 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6661343 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6661344 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6661345 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6661346 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6661347 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6661348 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6661349 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6661350 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6661351 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6661352 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6661353 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6661354 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6661355 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6661356 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
6661357 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
6661358 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
6661359 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
6661360 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
6661361 we can have a special election i prefer to put it on this ballot but you always have to go for the next best thing you cant always have it exactly your way
6661362 im optimistic that we will pass a budget in time for this election
6661363 willing to stay as long as it takes to get the right responsible kind of budget for california
6661364 i think we all could very quickly be on the same page if i would want to fix the budget problem only for this year and kick the problem down to next year but is that what i want no
6661365 republicans in the legislature have no interest in thinking long term
6661366 heres a chance to go to the democrats and say look youve never been for budget reform why dont you give us budget reform and in exchange we do a temporary sales tax increase it could work
6661367 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6661368 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6661369 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6661370 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6661371 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6661372 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6661373 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6661374 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6661375 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6661376 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6661377 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6661378 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6661379 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6661380 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6661381 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6661382 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6661383 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6661384 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6661385 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6661386 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6661387 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6661388 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6661389 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6661390 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6661391 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6661392 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6661393 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6661394 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6661395 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6661396 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6661397 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6661398 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6661399 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6661400 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6661401 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6661402 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6661403 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6661404 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6661405 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6661406 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6661407 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6661408 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6661409 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6661410 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6661411 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6661412 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6661413 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6661414 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6661415 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6661416 the fundamental basis of this nations laws was given to moses on the mount the fundamental basis of our bill of rights comes from the teachings we get from exodus and st matthew from isaiah and st paul
6661417 i dont think we emphasize that enough these days if we dont have a proper fundamental moral background we will finally end up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in rights for anybody except the state
6661418 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor
6661419 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6661420 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6661421 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6661422 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6661423 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6661424 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6661425 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6661426 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6661427 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6661428 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6661429 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6661430 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6661431 they told me there are going to be resources here
6661432 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6661433 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6661434 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6661435 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6661436 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6661437 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6661438 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6661439 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6661440 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6661441 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6661442 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6661443 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6661444 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6661445 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6661446 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6661447 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6661448 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6661449 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6661450 this is a planning took where all things are going
6661451 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6661452 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6661453 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6661454 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6661455 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6661456 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6661457 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6661458 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6661459 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6661460 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6661461 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6661462 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6661463 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6661464 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6661465 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6661466 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6661467 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6661468 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6661469 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6661470 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6661471 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6661472 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6661473 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6661474 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6661475 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6661476 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6661477 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6661478 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6661479 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6661480 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6661481 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6661482 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6661483 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6661484 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6661485 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6661486 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6661487 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6661488 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6661489 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6661490 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6661491 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6661492 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6661493 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6661494 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6661495 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6661496 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6661497 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6661498 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6661499 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6661500 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6661501 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6661502 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6661503 the claims about bullet voting in the dartmouth alumni election remind me that with a per voter average of voting for 1 8 candidates the proportion of bullet votes has to be fairly small the alternative as i mentioned in a communcation a day or two ago is that nearly everyone voted for one or three candidates but not two unlikely as that might be it would suggest that most of those who voted followed a strategy of either voting for the petition candidate or voting for all nominated candidates in which case richie s claim that the opposition was disorganized falls apart as does the claim by some of the alumni council people that in a 1 on 1 situation the petition candidate would been defeated
6661504 because approving a second choice may help defeat the voters first choice it is likely to devolve to typical vote for one plurality voting
6661505 ioc no proof china cheated in gymnastics theres no question on eligibility groups spokeswoman says
6661506 there arent too many authors of note who have passed through l a in the last three decades whom connie hasnt interviewed and interviewed well
6661507 this inherently transdisciplinary archive will provide material for research projects for generations of scholars and students
6661508 digitizing these tapes will give students and others an opportunity to hear and watch these outstanding authors for themselves whenever they want
6661509 seeing authors up close like this provides a rich point of view to their work
6661510 drucker believed that a healthy society is run by organizations whose values are shaped by a wide range of disciplines history sociology psychology culture and religion
6661511 in fact drucker once described management books as dreadful trash and suggested that he derived much of his philosophy from novelists such as austen balzac and others
6661512 is a beautiful setting for the tapes to call home
6661513 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6661514 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6661515 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6661516 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6661517 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6661518 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6661519 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6661520 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6661521 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6661522 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6661523 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6661524 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6661525 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6661526 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6661527 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6661528 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6661529 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6661530 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6661531 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6661532 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6661533 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6661534 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6661535 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6661536 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6661537 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6661538 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6661539 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6661540 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6661541 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6661542 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6661543 god says that it is not good for man to be in this state of singularity 36
6661544 experience differentiation as the content of ones own life ibid
6661545 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6661546 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6661547 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6661548 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6661549 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6661550 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6661551 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6661552 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6661553 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6661554 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6661555 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6661556 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6661557 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6661558 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6661559 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6661560 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6661561 btw going from the frying pan to the fire is technically
6661562 bowing to pressure from environmental groups the florida senate recently passed a bill backed by gov charlie crist that would eventually shut down six pipes that carry waste water into the atlantic from miami dade broward and palm beach counties
6661563 people are getting smart on the bs behind mmgw and that is exactly why algore is trying to recruit
6661564 no trippin we just have to stop dumping raw feces and piss into the ocean simple
6661565 i didnt know what to expect some kind of moonscape perhaps but it was incredible huge matrices of branching porites coral up to 8 meters 25 feet high had established creating a thriving coral reef habitat
6661566 throughout other parts of the lagoon it was awesome to see coral cover as high as 80 percent and large tree like branching coral formations with trunks 30 centimeters 12 inches thick
6661567 it seems like you won approval from all who write bs on every subject every day the know it alls stay true to yourself never change to please others or to fit in
6661568 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6661569 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6661570 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6661571 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6661572 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6661573 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6661574 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6661575 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6661576 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6661577 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6661578 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6661579 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6661580 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6661581 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6661582 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6661583 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6661584 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6661585 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6661586 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6661587 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6661588 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6661589 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6661590 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6661591 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6661592 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6661593 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6661594 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6661595 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6661596 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6661597 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6661598 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6661599 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6661600 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6661601 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6661602 vindicated i feel great i feel amazing i just won a gold medal
6661603 it was hard and this win wasnt just down to my goal
6661604 it was only achievable with the team we have and that we played for each other
6661605 i know it sounds crazy but im glad i went though it
6661606 this is such a reward for nine months of hard hard work and soul searching after the world cup
6661607 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6661608 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6661609 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6661610 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6661611 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6661612 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6661613 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6661614 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6661615 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6661616 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6661617 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6661618 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6661619 the longest ive ever lived anywhere was in the hanoy hilton
6661620 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6661621 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6661622 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6661623 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6661624 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6661625 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6661626 je suis venu vous dire que le travail que vous faites ici il est indispensable
6661627 parce quici se joue une partie de la libert du monde parce quici se m ne le combat contre le terrorisme
6661628 dans un cas au moins crivait lorganisation humanitaire les ch timents inflig s ont pris la forme dune mutilation
6661629 lorchestration de la campagne en faveur des femmes afghanes t moignait de similitudes frappantes dans le timing et les sc narios utilis s londres et washington
6661630 seuls les terroristes et les talibans menacent darracher les doigts qui ont les ongles vernis
6661631 en afghanistan si vous avez du vernis ongles vous pouvez avoir les ongles arrach s
6661632 en afghanistan que ce soit forc ou non cest un crime car les r gles musulmanes le disent je pense que cest bien il y a beaucoup de maladies qui peuvent tre provoqu es dans le monde daujourdhui travers des relations sexuelles ill gales comme le hiv
6661633 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6661634 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6661635 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6661636 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6661637 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6661638 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6661639 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6661640 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6661641 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6661642 the army and police arrested a suspected bomber not far away from scene of the attack
6661643 they also recovered a suicide jacket from a nearby mosque and seized explosives
6661644 i looked back and saw the limbs of my colleagues flying through the air
6661645 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6661646 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6661647 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6661648 jadi untuk memaksimalkan penampilan pada saat manggung dan dapat memuaskan penonton kami pakai band sesuai dengan konsep albumku
6661649 manajemenku yang mencarikan band pengiring semuanya diambil secara acak dan akhirnya cocok sampai sekarang
6661650 itu enggak benar itu bohong kami cuma teman saja sama seperti semuanya
6661651 the possibility of a block is high and id say it should be due to a content issue
6661652 weve seen the situation but cant offer any more information
6661653 two major incidents happened and not one thing came out of the ombudmans office
6661654 i went to the office in relation to being arrested for the northern bank robbery four times
6661655 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw

6661657 we cant create new spaces so lets see if we can free up some places
6661658 we decided to start the program because we want to create as many patient parking spots as we can
6661659 we have a shortage of parking because of the new construction and we dont want to encroach on our neighborhood either
6661660 the doctors parking lot has really contracted and so we want to make sure that we are not taking up spaces for patients
6661661 thank you jesus i didnt i wanted to see it operate first
6661662 there were no injuries and the cause is still under investigation
6661663 the owner complained of having electrical problems in the past
6661664 were looking into that it appears maybe it started in the kitchen area thats where the breaker box was
6661665 jeg tror jeg f r min stab til at give dig svaret

6661667 despite its reputation for sunny hot and muggy weather august actually is the second wettest month of the year in galveston county it turns out that the heavy rains weve seen over the past couple of weeks are not that rare for this time of year
6661668 his cousin said vincent was playing in the ditch and he was going to go back to call his friends to where he was playing
6661669 it doesnt appear she was speeding and she didnt have a stop sign
6661670 dwarka does not even get half of the water that it should villages around dwarka are dependent on tube well water there is no piped water from the delhi jal board for them and they are forced to use unfit tube well water it is impractical to increase the city limits
6661671 nobody else is gonna come along to develop something like this in the city so we need to take whatever we can get
6661672 legal and easy way for elected officials to reward their biggest contributors
6661673 chief asset and most reliable tool for economic development is our historic architecture
6661674 chief asset and most reliable tool for economic development is our historic architecture
6661675 chief asset and most reliable tool for economic development is our historic architecture
6661676 my main concern was to clear my name not about what punishment bertolino would get
6661677 i told the chief i would smile and take it for all the stuff i probably got away with over the years
6661678 when it comes to founders we know we are usually going to see something odd
6661679 in some cases they are exorbitantly paid and in others they are paid miserly
6661680 its about saving money but also about being more environmentally conscious
6661681 i think there is a race among all these companies to integrate energy efficiency into all their products
6661682 its about trying to be in business in a smart way
6661683 it could be months before any resolution if that happened
6661684 they know its their own hubris and overreaching thats caused save a watt to stall
6661685 we think that we made an excellent case and that save a watt is an excellent model
6661686 we spent lots of spreadsheets and analysis on the profit margins just page after page
6661687 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6661688 trends in the charitable marketplace growth competition and rising demand to build capacity
6661689 who are the junior league amp what can they do for you
6661690 our goal is for the chevrolet cruze to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment
6661691 the global economy is sputtering amid a widening in the slowdown from the united states to western europe and japan
6661692 rising inflation has squeezed household real incomes especially in the developed world and curtailed real spending
6661693 but in a scientific mystery that threatens the u s food supply business as usual is not acceptable
6661694 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
6661695 io voglio guarire voglio provare sensazioni quello che pensavo non era mai la realt voglio lasciar andare via il dolore che ho provato fino adesso cancellare proprio tutto il dolore io voglio guarire voglio provare sensazioni sentirmi vicina a qualcosa di vero voglio trovare qualcosa che ho voluto fino adesso qualche luogo a cui appartenere

6661698 there are so many moms and kids are still suffering he knows how to play the system because he was a judge but the damage he did is irreversible
6661699 he maintains his crimes were victimless and blames widespread systemic media reports for the publics and the temporary release committees alleged misconception with regard to the nature of his crimes
6661700 just to say were in the middle of the pacific between china and the mainland and thats a great natural advantage for what
6661701 to properly fund and create the school of engineering at the university of hawaii
6661702 if you have a great school of engineering you have great engineering professors and great students and those great students will come up with great ideas and if you have students with ideas the money will flow the corporate financial attorneys will flow the pr firms will flow everything is because of two guys in a garage with a great idea yes you can create funds to make that easier for two guys in a garage but if you dont have two guys in a garage it doesnt matter how many funds you have
6661703 correct me if im wrong but hawaii cant even build a mass transit system that stops at the airport and the university of hawaii and waikiki
6661704 excuse me i mean why else would you build a mass transit system no instead its going to go to salt lake can you see why i would be scratching my head
6661705 shes the shoulders upon which alltop is being built right now
6661706 i dont know where we would be without neenz shes a very intelligent person and that counts for everything with me and also shes willing to grind it out there are a lot of smart people who are lazy if you combine a person who is smart and willing to grind it out
6661707 its ridiculous how fast can you go before the world record cant be broke how fast can the human
6661708 to bel air someone is to tell them a shaggy dog story supposedly relating to a serious matter and

6661714 has petitioned but her signatures have not yet been certified
6661715 called me on july 5th it happened very quick i didnt hesitate because thats just my personality but by the time i got to the convention in chicago it was such a whirlwind it was so fast the nomination meeting hundreds of green party members it wasnt til i got off that stage that i was like holy s im gonna be on a ballot in 40 states that is so surreal
6661716 i came to know about cynthia mckinney when she had the hearings on political prisoners in congress and then she started talking about tupac and his files and trying to get the files from the fbi i was in the malcolm x grassroots movement and we were working on so much around political prisoners she started bringing me out to her brain trust as part of the congressional black caucus she was involved in the state of the black world with ron daniels which i was involved with and then she brought me out to this big tupac event in atlanta with chuck d of course when they got her out of office she went to cornell to teach one of those two week things and she just got so harassed she got death threats this was after the september 11 hearings where she was grilling rumsfeld after they arrested her whatever the capitol police did to her
6661717 people have always said you gotta tone it down rosa youre too honest you cant always say what you say and i think everything i did got me to this position because i think i am genuine and i think that a lot of cats arent i t has come at the expense of a lot of s i know that but i cant be any other way and i think cynthia is just shes completely uncompromising that is the most needed value right now in our movement
6661718 the automated program of the notice which is now it is exclusive university focused
6661719 warner music group has confirmed that its music is no longer available through last fms on demand music streaming service
6661720 i do not think im going to sue anyone that already this morning peoples opinion of me has been lowered
6661721 it was the one stage answer to that situation and one of things where us asked that to us to do now it not that times when we are ready to give something free of charge it was a moment in time
6661722 in the name of network management policymakers permit carriers to act in unreasonable anti competitive fashion
6661723 it is not a question of whether consumers will have laws guarding against internet gatekeepers but how those laws will be crafted
6661724 my father carried it for a long time mack brown carried it for a long time ill have to carry it until i do it its the lay of the land
6661725 ill stop answering that question once i win it until then itll always be my question its a legitimate question
6661726 how it relates to texas or oklahoma i dont know
6661727 but to what weve had in the past its the best
6661728 we know well have to hold it down while the offense gets things figured it out
6661729 we made it work last year but its still hard
6661730 i always said hey you think i am doing good you should see my little brother
6661731 you can see it coming and i am glad hes transitioned well into his new team
6661732 the next thing i am waiting for is for him to remember who helped him get to this point and give some of that information my way
6661733 one day i might call it a race car but i keep calling it a cot because we just havent quite turned the corner literally with this new car and trying to get it to handle better
6661734 theres probably less bumping now just because you dont have to bump a guy out of the way to get a position
6661735 the first time we went there i think the tires were a little too hard
6661736 the last time we went there it was more like the old bristol but you still had a couple of options from the bottom to the middle i think once they got the tires squared away the race track kind of came back around and the racing was a lot more normal
6661737 and it would be a dream come true me kicking in the nfl then being able to come back to kenan stadium and watch my brother kick for the tar heels
6661738 were both working hard to try to make that happen
6661739 whether its an onside kick a kickoff a short field goal an extra point whoever gives us the best chance to make that work thats whos going to be in the game
6661740 because each one of them has something now that they do well
6661741 the one thing that no one can answer is how they will react when there are 65 000 people in the stands and mom and dad are there and if they miss the kick we lose the game
6661742 hes a little bit smaller than i was as a freshman but hes got the tools and the mentality to get it done
6661743 its got to be through relationships handing out tracts would not go over well at all
6661744 if foreigners do such things in china they violate the law and local religious departments and other departments should stop them
6661745 it was the wrong decision and i think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that
6661746 theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves
6661747 no i dont even think about whatever i said last year im just enjoying this moment right now i feel great i just won a gold medal i feel amazing
6661748 so i had no doubt i was going to play one of my best games
6661749 this medal has nothing to do with whether or not healing had taken place
6661750 healing had to take place in my own heart to even get this far
6661751 theres no upside to being adversarial in these kind of deals youve just got to stay positive and youve got to focus on whos here and have trust and faith in the people that are working on getting everything done
6661752 real life goes on its not just about the building and the redskins and here we go and now were playing the carolina panthers it really is about the real life situations and theyre hard
6661753 i think its a sad day for anybody who has any affinity or relationship or caring about anything to do with the nfl
6661754 young players who never knew him and never had a chance to see him are huge beneficiaries of the sacrifices hes made the dedication the time the effort and a lot of the headaches hes put up with
6661755 no matter how good we are as individuals if you dont have a leader its not going to be right i just took that responsibility from day one
6661756 for me to lead 11 other superstars i have to kind of have that chip on my shoulder
6661757 i did it for one because they all wanted them when they saw me with them
6661758 and its a team camaraderie thing for me im all about team the easiest thing to do to bring a team together is to give them a gift we all love gifts
6661759 we didnt play well we didnt have a leader this team has a totally different feel
6661760 it wasnt a great experience for me i was 19 years old i thought i was good enough to be playing but i wasnt playing i was away from home for 37 days and not doing what i love to do so it was hard
6661761 we are all our teams superstars back in the league so when we come here we give up ourselves for the team
6661762 its good for all of us its been fun to watch these guys and get to know what to do when i get back to my team
6661763 we came to compete and it falls right here if we dont not on them it falls on me
6661764 they say if it hits your hand you should have it i take the blame for it
6661765 im a veteran ive never dropped the stick in my life its upsetting
6661766 the frustrating thing is we felt so good coming out
6661767 we had the lead after the first three legs and i was about ready to put my hands up
6661768 im not quite sure exactly what happened we came out here to compete
6661769 we came out here to run our hearts out get some revenge toward jamaica maybe you focus too much on it
6661770 we were ready for this test and it was a test
6661771 they played a great game even when we werent making our shots they seemed to be making everything we never got rattled
6661772 making it this far was nice but i was trying to win
6661773 im definitely disappointed i played well but wish i couldve played better
6661774 every time i held my putter i could feel it was going to go in
6661775 a lot of people dont understand where power comes from
6661776 i realized that inherent with large organizations like unions and all the members they represent there is a lot of financial power there that had never been tapped
6661777 that financial power was and is being used against them
6661778 turned the money over to the banks and insurance companies and investment companies
6661779 since money is power and these are collection agencies of money then theyre collection agencies of power
6661780 as long as theyre all making money what a great world this is

6661875 antes de estudiar las obras del presidente mao lo nico que me importaba era lo que me pertenec a yo sab a precisamente cu ntos montones del esti rcol del yak ten a en casa sab a incluso cu ntos estaban secos y cu ntos no sin mirar pero no me importaban tanto los animales de la colectiva las ense anzas del presidente mao me agrandaron los horizontes ahora el prop sito de mi vida lo tengo claro hoy me preocupo no solo por la colectiva sino por todo el mundo y la revoluci n mundial
6661876 ahora sabemos que no eran los dioses ni los demonios que hac an funcionar los motores nosotros los manejamos y vimos que no era la sangre de los ni os que los hac an funcionar como nos dijeron los lamas

6661891 we want people to see these stories through as many distribution points as possible
6661892 and i was right it was the hardest job i could find
6661893 i worked all night and on the weekends and had all the tombstones ads that appear in financial publications following a deal to prove it
6661894 i was having a really macho career i was in the right place and now i sort of feel like i have other fish to fry
6661895 opt out patterns across careers labor force participation rates among educated mothers
6661896 the seemingly softer tone to the committees discussion in keeping with a more muted outlook in the inflation report does seem to have pretty much ruled out any prospect of a rate hike which was already slim as it would risk an unnecessarily deep downturn
6661897 although we envisage the first rate cut next year there is every chance that the mpc begins to cut as early as november especially if commodity prices continue to fall and economic activity falters as expected
6661898 concerns about demand were a more important factor in restraining investment than restrictions in the supply of credit although credit was becoming harder to obtain
6661899 key players would likely prefer to delay action until after the november elections if possible
6661900 if home prices were going up and you could hold on to a house for a long time you might be able to make a case that its a better time to buy
6661901 but if you have the ability to rent for half the price without the liabilities that go with owning its a smarter decision to rent
6661902 people feel nervous about trying to time the bottom of the housing market but they dont need to feel that urgency
6661903 a year from now they can come back to the market and theyre not going to lose anything
6661904 if you think youre at all in harms way you shouldnt be in the second home market
6661905 it doesnt matter how affordable a house is if you dont have any income
6661906 i dont think the market will turn around quickly there are probably great deals on yachts right now too but not everybody can buy them
6661907 with values declining its difficult for many to make the leap and purchase a property with the concern that they will lose equity
6661908 but at the same time the suburban product whether its single family homes or condos are at price points where its difficult to construct them at those levels
6661909 it makes no fiscal sense whatsoever to buy a second home it barely makes fiscal sense to buy a first home
6661910 if you rent you know what the costs are if something breaks its somebody elses headache its a vacation
6661911 there is a really high likelihood that we would no bid the program
6661912 this is an airplane thats going to be in the inventory 40 years
6661913 what were asking for is an additional four months to have a meaningful competition
6661914 we hope that it was just the beginning of a continuing dialogue as we move toward a final rfp that prescribes the right aircraft and gives appropriate weight to all of the capabilities that will be required for the evolving mission over the next several decades
6661915 boeing remains committed to providing the air force with a next generation tanker that meets real world mission requirements and that is selected through a fair open and unbiased competition that follows a realistic timetable
6661916 it is also clear that the department recognizes the need to begin production of the next generation of aerial refueling tankers as quickly as possible
6661917 we look forward to submitting our proposal within the timeline established by the defense dept
6661918 associations must do this thing i like or sell or they wont survive
6661919 i am with you it would help to have a little trade assoc knowledge at asae hope to meet you at
6661920 actually i was talking about a management conference for execs who work for trade business
6661921 consumer groups theyre associations too should be included in that conference it would provide
6661922 thanks for a great post i sent this link to our local membership staff retention is especially
6661923 the eyes are the first thing that you have to destroy because they have seen too many bad things
6661924 i hadnt really thought about it just being together with her was almost as if almost almost like a drug
6661925 thats perhaps an extreme way of saying it i just wanted to live an obscure life in baltimore
6661926 it was given to me by the one person to whom ive always looked up to one person whom ive known since i was small
6661927 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6661928 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6661929 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6661930 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6661931 its hard for the teacher to give the one to one attention every student deserves
6661932 i feel we are getting into the unsafe territory because it is too large amount of people in one space
6661933 we are communicating to customers around the country making sure that were answering any questions concerning it
6661934 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
6661935 our job is to fight hard but on the mat
6661936 the girls look like sunday but treat you like saturday night
6661937 no blast sounds were heard on the audio tracks of video recordings during the collapse of wtc 7 or reported by witnesses
6661938 it is very difficult to find what you are not looking for
6661939 how much longer do we have to endure the coverup of how building 7 was destroyed
6661940 our job was to come up with the best science
6661941 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies
6661942 they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
6661943 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6661944 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6661945 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6661946 oh my god what if they actually you know read my writing and see how bad it is
6661947 i hadnt really thought about it just being together with her was almost as if almost almost like a drug
6661948 thats perhaps an extreme way of saying it i just wanted to live an obscure life in baltimore
6661949 it was given to me by the one person to whom ive always looked up to one person whom ive known since i was small
6661950 karena kalau sudah memasuki bulan ber september desember biasanya curah hujan akan meningkat
6661951 oh were sorry those guys they would protect you not hurt you
6661952 i have yet to hear the pakistani side in this but if this is a sign that journalists will be subject to reprisals for reporting honestly on conditions in pakistan that is a cause for serious concern
6661953 the image that is reflecting in me in the water is deformed deforming i am an other
6661954 i heard a loud splat on the front door i walked out and looked
6661955 i was angry when i got to the bottom of the hill and he was coming back for a second try
6661956 international organized criminals control significant positions in the global energy and strategic materials markets they are expanding their holdings in these sectors which corrupts the normal functioning of these markets and may have a destabilizing effect on us geopolitical interests
6661957 what did henry paulson know and when did he know it
6661958 the government has no policy to revoke thaksins red passport
6661959 he was more a figure who was there when chinese politics pivoted than himself being a pivotal figure
6661960 he succeeded mao briefly because he was a guy nobody felt could dominate so he didnt set off alarm bells in any camp
6661961 in the course of this struggle comrade hua guofeng bravely stood the storm and resolutely protected and implemented chairman maos revolutionary line and policies

6661967 what it does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6661968 we are not opposed to the use of irradiation but its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source
6661969 this investment in canadas research hospitals will result in new insights into the causes of illness new approaches to prevention and treatment improved health care delivery systems and ultimately in an improved quality of life for all canadians
6661970 our researchers are currently spread out over more than 65 separate labs located in 50 to 100 year old buildings that impose severe constraints on their activities
6661971 given the world class achievements of our scientists and clinicians in these poor conditions one can only dream of the discoveries that will emerge from a modern facility that is designed to encourage the interdisciplinary collaborations and synergies that are the basis for true scientific innovation
6661972 increases in the number of imaging scanners over the last few years mean that the majority currently installed and in use in canada are less than six years old
6661973 these newer machines are using the latest technology to produce more detailed scans
6661974 with nearly half of all infants in north america being delivered by caesarean section or after episiotomy there is clearly a requirement for pain relief for mothers
6661975 however our study confirms that codeine as a treatment for pain may be unsuitable and cannot be considered safe for all breastfed infants
6661976 hey remember me im the baby you gave up for adoption sixteen years ago
6661977 sometime between now and the convention barack obama just like the cool kid in study hall will surreptitiously send a text message announcing his pick for vice president
6661978 ces comportements l sont inacceptables a d clar chevallier je peux comprendre quils en aient gros sur la patate apr s ce qui sest pass quils critiquent lattitude de certains relayeurs mais la premi re chose faire cest den parler entre nous cela ressemble un d douanement

6661981 we never really played any games that were decided on the final possession until this season these new teams are tough man last week we had a nail biter against brotherhood and this week was the same with b o b these new teams are tough man
6661982 everyone talks about primetime or flashback having the best guards but theres no doubt that we have the best backcourt in gold but with pj lee in the lineup i truly feel we have the best team
6661983 id rather lose games with my family and my true friends rather than win games with people i barely even know
6661984 i didnt think id score a career high 38 points but lebronze or not 38 is great
6661985 i remember seeing sasha vujacic take and make meaningless a three pointer in the nba finals at the buzzer that shot helped cover the spread i guess superstar basketball has a machine of their own now
6661986 the aces got tired quickly and were fortunate their shots were falling in
6661987 both squads playing with just 5 players seems like everyones on vacation this weekend
6661988 if youre gonna call yourselves shooters you girls need to learn how to shoot
6661989 we dont want to press we only have 5 players
6661990 without point guard jodian the team had no true ball handlers
6661991 their loss justifies how much jodian means to the team and why shes a mvp candidate
6661992 fijis people need to realise that in going forward as a nation we may have to paddle our canoes on our own
6661993 each one of the us as the citizens of this country must now ask are we going to be bullied and pressured into doing things that are clearly not in our national interest
6661994 if we succumb to such pressures what next what will that do to our self worth as an independent nation
6661995 you all are aware of the high level public posturing by the leaders of the two countries both days before the forum meeting and after they learnt that fiji will not be in the niue meeting
6661996 the pacific island countries will need to be vigilant to protect the forum organisation becoming a foreign policy tool of these two countries
6661997 they now seem to have usurped the moral leadership of the region
6661998 against this background and the situation which fiji is in now fijis people need to realise that in going forward as a nation we may have to paddle our canoes on our own
6661999 we dont expect the situation to deteriorate but we would be remiss in our duty not have a plan in place in the event the situation did deteriorate
6662000 if however the airport at nadi was closed then we would have to consider whether a military evacuation by air or by sea was necessary
6662001 we would work with what ever government was in place in fiji to try to get their concurrence if that was not possible then in the last instance the lives and the well being of our citizens would be paramount and we would do it with or without that concurrence
6662002 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
6662003 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded on to a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost the transfer of data on this assignment to the external contractor has been suspended
6662004 this is a massive failure of duty what is more scandalous is that it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data rendering them unfit to be charged with protecting our safety
6662005 it seems extraordinary that a private company should be entrusted with and then lose so much confidential data when criminal justice agencies are still unable to share computerised information between themselves
6662006 im hurting i think i might have broken my hand and im cut all over
6662007 im only 19 theres so much more to come from me as an athlete i feel like i might not want to see my bike for a while

6662012 shes not the type of person to say hey i dont feel good
6662013 all i hear from her is i hate having this i dont want to take my shot
6662014 i have seen people who go dangerously bad right away
6662015 she may not make the right decisions and so forth
6662016 the situation is ridiculous there was never an issue that it was in the way
6662017 people used to go out there to have a smoke and pass the time of day i cant understand why anyone would complain were all shocked
6662018 the bench was very popular it was nice to sit out there
6662019 we used to have a back room which was for smokers but when the ban came in there was no where for them to go
6662020 the bench was not left out overnight either it was only out from 9 3pm every day
6662021 customers want it back and we are hoping that the council will change their mind
6662022 i handed the petition into the council with a comment that i wasnt happy with the situation
6662023 obstructions can cause dangerous situations especially for anyone with poor vision those with young children in pushchairs and for wheelchair users
6662024 i swear im not the devil though you think i am i swear im not the devil
6662025 the provision of infertility treatment has not been seen as a traditional nhs service and therefore is often viewed as a relatively low priority compared to more visible conditions whose impact is well established
6662026 the groups final report will seek to consider the often unseen consequences of infertility including the impact on mental health and general wellbeing which may draw on other nhs services for treatment as well as the positive benefits of ivf
6662027 lack of knowledge and understanding of infertility and its treatment
6662028 it is appropriate for ivf to be considered carefully for inclusion on the national tariff
6662029 clinicians and practitioners involved in infertility services are all aware that we are not just dealing with a physical pathology
6662030 infertility is a disease but it also has fallout beyond that for a significant proportion of couples causing mental health problems depression stress related illnesses and so on

6662035 you cheated two vulnerable people of the large part of the real value of an elderly mans home
6662036 its a terrific outcome today because this sort of behaviour is completely unacceptable and thats why we terminated his agreement

6662055 this confirmation demonstrates that mr osullivans claim was a falsehood and he should now apologise for misleading the australian public
6662056 it is also incumbent upon optus to say whether it has received confirmation that its network information meets the governments requirements

6662059 its not so much that people think the russians will cut anybody off its more that the market was in a slide and there were questions of whether wed pierce the 100 psychological level we were creeping toward it
6662060 with current opec production well above the expected demand for opec crude there is potential for a sharp build in crude oil inventories
6662061 in light of these ongoing changes in the market opec will continue to closely monitor market developments ahead of the upcoming ministerial meeting in september
6662062 is now such that only a price rally back to well above 120 a barrel is likely to be able to halt a substantial removal of opec crude output from the market
6662063 should prices move back up into the 120s and look steady then a cut is less likely
6662064 the russia georgia situation remains unresolved and is contributing to increased bellicosity between russia and nato as well as russia and the u s
6662065 russia is well aware that its intransigence is contributing to another run up in oil prices certainly a favorable development as far as their economy is concerned
6662066 but we dont want to downplay the threat of russia using all its oil and gas supply as an economic tool to en force events
6662067 whether that will occur is still far out into the future today showed the market might be vulnerable to ramifications of that kind of thing

6662260 its unusual to be asked what we are going to do ahead of a rate cut but on what we know today this is a pretty simple equation anz chief executive mike smith said
6662261 if funding costs continue at the current levels and the reserve bank do actually cut rates then there will be a full flow on to our mortgage customers
6662262 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down he said
6662263 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision
6662264 publicly committed to fully addressing the pressing problem of global warming and moving the united states toward a new energy future he has made clean energy one of the top issues of his campaign and as a public servant at the state and federal levels has a long and consistent record of supporting the environment
6662265 was absent from each and every environment or energy related vote
6662266 if president mugabe goes ahead to convene parliament appoint a new cabinet it means he is proceeding to violate the conditions of the memorandum of understanding which means he may have abandoned the basis for talks but we dont know what his intentions are
6662267 a violation of the memorandum will have to be dealt with by the mediator
6662268 i also submit that the settlement talks based on the results of the election impugned herein are equally an infringement upon my rights as already declared by this court and the constitution of the government of the republic of zimbabwe based on such talks will be in itself an infringement on my rights aforesaid
6662269 i was impressed by the depth of detail and preparation i heard from the university of idaho
6662270 now is a time to take a small step rather than a large leap we need to have a law school presence in boise but we need to be sure that all the parameters are in order first

6662275 i know about the significance of this olympic medal since there are not many such medals going to central america
6662276 and this is of course the first gold for panama i am extremely proud to have won this medal for the people in my country because they have given me a lot of support i have no idea what is happening back there right know i heard there is a holiday now after this they are partying i will find out what is going on there once i get there may be the president will do something to commemorate this medal
6662277 i wanted more and i felt able to jump a personal best here
6662278 i came to beijing being fit that is why i had hoped to jump further then i had a difficult start in the competition because i felt a pain in my leg i knew that i had to fight hard for this gold medal in the end i have achieved the main thing winning
6662279 when i was young i was quite a naughty boy playing baseball my elder brother then took me with him to athletics and that was how it all started now i am sitting here
6662280 the olympic gold is of course an even bigger medal for me but the world championships are also very important and you really have to win them both which i have now achieved with these medals i hope to motivate youngsters in central america to take up the sport so that one day we will get more medals in this region
6662281 it is half a brazilian medal and half or may be just a bit more than half a panamanian one
6662282 and i will stay there until the olympic games in london 2012 after these i plan to end my career

6662287 i love embroidery because every figure i embroider tells a story i create people carrying things flowers and animals and they each say something to those who take the time to look at them
6662288 i started working as an embroiderer two years ago and a year ago i got the job as shop assistant when i started working for heartworks i had no other form of income
6662289 because of my job i can start planning the future of my son who is five years old without this work there would not have been any future
6662290 it all depends on how hard i feel like working during the month if i work hard i make more money because i get paid per item i enjoy working for heartworks because i love sewing and embroidery
6662291 it is important for me to pay the people who work for me a fair wage i also pay them transport costs labour has a certain amount of hours attached to it and eventually the costs are translated into the price of the object
6662292 unfortunately many people believe crafts have to be inexpensive because in the past it could be picked up quite cheaply on the side of the road
6662293 i asked the crafters to add words and flowers and butterflies to give it a woodstock hippy feel my agent from paris submitted the cushions to the fair and it was accepted for one of the trends pavilions these pavilions showcase items that indicate a trend

6662319 the shape of the face may have been honed by evolution as a marker of the propensity for aggressive behavior though our ancestors did not pick up this warning sign
6662320 our findings suggest that people can make accurate inferences about others personality traits and behavioral dispositions based on certain signals conveyed by the face
6662321 the facial structure of a man provides an indication of how aggressive he will be in a competitive situation so we are able to predict with some accuracy the behavior of men on the basis of their facial features
6662322 the authorities want to protect elisabeth and her children and stop the trial from becoming some sort of ghoulish daily freak show
6662323 our bombers carried out todays attack it is in reaction to military operations in swat and bajaur

6662337 it feels like when were going out there its tough
6662338 every game is tough these days but we need to make it daunting for players and teams coming to wembley
6662339 we will get there we will build on that but its about getting the confidence up which will happen in the qualifiers
6662340 the manager thrives on challenges he wants the best out of the team and hell get that
6662341 people expect change straight away and it just doesnt happen like that
6662342 it is step by step its about bonding together as a team as a unit and that takes time
6662343 there is a lot difference its the tiny things the minute details
6662344 it wont happen overnight people who understand the game know that managers sometimes come in there is a big blitz of goals and then it fades away
6662345 what we have done is the right way slowly we are getting better
6662346 we are going up and down a little bit but were going in the right direction
6662347 its in place now weve got the coach the captain the vice captain now we can start moving forward
6662348 we have got the cobwebs out of the way back into the england mindset
6662349 we have got to go away and there are some important games for our clubs but we are set for england now
6662350 we had no more ammunition for our other weapons and we were left only with our famas assault rifles
6662351 many lsu fans would be offended by being ranked this low
6662352 president bush had wished him musharraf well and thanked him for his efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as the fight against al qaeda and extremist groups
6662353 the us will continue to remain involved in the battle against extremists and will assist pakistan in overcoming its economic crisis
6662354 is quite an irony for a bunch of leftists who have been known to yap at others for their lack of transparency
6662355 barack obamas failure to accurately report his campaigns financial records is an incredibly suspicious situation that appears to be an attempt to hide his campaigns interaction with a left wing organization previously convicted of voter fraud for a candidate who claims to be practicing new politics his fec reports look an awful lot like the old style chicago politics of yesterday

6662361 on this track most of the hardest hit drought areas from northern georgia into southwestern virginia would miss out on much needed rainfall
6662362 nevertheless abundant to locally excessive rain will likely bring significant improvement to southernmost drought areas in the eastern gulf coast region with fays remnants taking a possible northward turn into the tennessee valley early next week
6662363 the potential is big because at the end of the day they are the hegemon in that region and we are not and thats a fact
6662364 damien can be proud of everything he has achieved at this club he has got every ounce out of himself as a player and set a great example for younger players that have come through the club
6662365 these decisions are very difficult but we have set a direction that we want to take as club it is important that we inject as much youth as possible into the club at the moment particularly given the draft implications beyond this season and unfortunately that means making some hard calls and damien was one of those

6662371 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6662372 if you want to give the murray darling basin a fighting chance then compulsory acquisition obviously on just terms is the way to get things done
6662373 what the government needs to know is that this is the biggest issue facing my state they can expect me to be absolutely determined to get a fair result for my state
6662374 but were talking about a system now that has been grossly over allocated and unless we do something were not going to be able to save that system

6662453 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

6662461 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6662462 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6662463 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6662464 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6662465 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6662466 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6662467 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6662468 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

6662473 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6662474 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother

6662482 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

6662552 we have known for some time that young and middle aged adults who are overweight run a higher risk of death and it was presumed that this held true for older people in fact our results show that the risk of dying is higher only for the most severely obese but that all older people who are overweight are at significantly increased risk of developing problems with mobility and carrying out everyday tasks
6662553 this research is important because a growing proportion of the population is aged 65 or over and more and more of these older people are overweight in fact in most developed countries middle aged and elderly adults are more likely to be obese than people in any other age group these findings have huge significance for the delivery of health care both now and in the future increasing numbers of older people and higher levels of overweight and obesity will lead to a greater burden of disability and ill health and place an immense strain on health and social services the issue is likely to get worse as time goes on and represents a ticking time bomb for health services around the world
6662554 staying a healthy weight can be a fun and relatively easy thing to do even as people get older
6662555 our experience of running supported walking and cycling groups has shown that older people benefit in many ways from regular physical activity
6662556 people are living longer but this study shows that excess weight can have a real impact on the quality of peoples lives which can reduce the benefit of those extra years we must do all we can to encourage older friends or relatives to build enjoyable exercise into their daily routine and develop good habits ourselves to take into our retirement years people can visit www strollbacktheyears info or www healthpromcornwall org 01209 313419 for more advice

6662566 with our technology we can image specific cells in real time with exquisite selectivity which allows us to track their location and movement and to count the apparent number of cells present we then use conventional mri to obtain a high resolution image that places the labeled cells in their anatomical context
6662567 the large background signal from mobile water and intrinsic tissue contrast differences can often make it challenging to unambiguously identify regions containing these metal ion labeled cells throughout the body which is the current state of the art
6662568 right now were using our technology to image key cell types involved in autoimmune diseases like type i diabetes but our cellular mri agents also can be adapted to label other cell types including cells from bone marrow and stem cells a key long term application of our technology is to label and monitor cell based therapeutics in humans

6662627 the iraq issue has been kind of difficult for mccain to deal with
6662628 if the white house can work out some sort of agreement to demobilize in iraq that could make life a little easier for mccain because he has been forced over the last months to defend his hawkish position on iraq
6662629 it could demonstrate that obama had a credible claim when he suggested a deal could be worked out
6662630 lowers iraq on the list of voters concerns and re emphasizes the success of the surge and mccain was right and obama was wrong on the surge
6662631 any news out of iraq good or bad reminds people of the 4 300 lives weve lost and nearly a trillion dollars we will have spent by the time we get out

6662653 and in a sense quite beautifully i suppose its true when you truly see somebody with whom you are overjoyed at spending the rest of your life with whom you can see a great journey the end of that journey is death so in a sense youre looking at your own mortality

6662698 rueben was unceremoniously dumped at the shelter by his owners who didnt have much information to offer about him other than they didnt have time for him and he had been crated most of his life which is the reason for his poor stature and lack of muscle tone in his legs
6662699 he is a sweetheart of a guy and he desperately needs and deserves a better home than the one he was unfortunate to land in before he was dumped at the shelter
6662700 during our walk yesterday he was very sweet and he walked along just fine with me

6662707 a new dog in my work area and after poking around he belongs to no one
6662708 i work in a high dog dump area due to the amount of junkyard dogs in the area all owned and taken care of trust me i keep track and this guy showed up about 2 days ago
6662709 he is eating and drinking the food and water i have put out but he wont come close enough to get to know me and let me pet him take him to my vet
6662710 im looking for advice and or help here i dont know how to gauge if feeding him will get him to warm up to me or if he would be better off being hauled off by ac and maybe pulled by a gsd rescue group he is also scared of the camera so getting a shot of him is quite tricky

6662715 i grew up in eastern kansas near the neosho river
6662716 there used to be an old cheyenne warrior near the river used to tell stories to us boys was like a rite of passage all the boys in that town used to go through out there on those lost golden plains wed go to school and then go home and help on the farm and have supper and then a couple of usd get together and head over to the old cheyennes house and listen to his stories he had a white woman for a wife and shed bake us cookies and wed eat them with fresh milk and the old man would tell us stories and wed be thinking about them long after we went back home that night and kissed our mothers and lied there full of energy and sleepless in the shadows stories about dog soldiers and red mens electric sprits stories about beautiful young women with eyes and hair as black as this robe and stories about the sun rituals and their divine truths we sat eating cookies by the hearth and the old man would tell us about the lost souls of the dead roaming that country and his eyes darkened into granite pools and his face pulsed a deep hypnotic red with the glow of the fire he used to tell us indian legends about massacres during the white mans conquest of the indigenous peoples and he said that men and women oughtnt be killed according to the jurisprudence of other men and women but that only the one spirit was the ultimate arbiter of souls and that all souls stripped of their privileges without the spirits consent would be reinserted into the world into positions of moral superiority and social credence the old man told us this and said it was common knowledge among his people and that is why certain white officers during the westward march would so freely order the executions of red people or any souls deemed uncivilized because to take the life of a red man or woman was to do them a favor in their next lifetime
6662717 the old man said those people would return to the world as a grain of sand until the end of time for orders are indeed orders they can be dishonored just as easily as friendship between a white man and a red man this is what the old man said

6662725 spettano al consiglio superiore della magistratura secondo le norme dellordinamento giudiziario le assunzioni le assegnazionio ed i trasferimenti le promozioni e i provvedimenti disciplinari nei riguardi dei magistrati
6662726 se introduciamo la politica nel consiglio rischiamo di richiamarci ad un modello autoritario ovverosia quello fascista dove la magistratura non e indipendente dal potere politico e quindi non tutti i cittadini sono garantiti allo stesso modo
6662727 la corte europea potrebbe avere delle riserve nel senso che alcuni principi della costituzione come quello di uguaglianza non sono modificabili e quindi possibile che si apra una discussione molto seria a livello di corte di giustizia europea proprio sulla compatibilit di questo modello con i principi della convenzione europea
6662728 non dobbiamo dimenticare che il sistema giudiziario attuale che garantisce lautonomia della magistratura stato scritto sulla base delle vicende storiche del 48 i giudici in passato obbedivano al governo fascista la scelta di una magistratura indipendente che si governa da sola e stata fatta sulla base di quella esperienza

6662739 lintervista del vescovo li shan pu essere considerata uno dei segnali con cui da parte cinese si risponde alla disponibilit e allauspicio manifestato dal papa nella sua lettera di un anno fa per cercare una normalizzazione dei rapporti tra cina e santa sede
6662740 diversi problemi importanti non sono stati risolti ma da parte della santa sede vi lintenzione e la volont di continuare a portare avanti un dialogo leale e costruttivo
6662741 del tutto prematuro per ora parlare di un viaggio del papa in cina tuttavia le parole del vescovo li shan manifestano che tutti i cattolici cinesi amano e rispettano il papa ne riconoscono lautorit e sarebbero lieti di incontrarlo e questo certo un aspetto molto positivo ed incoraggiante

6662750 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security

6662801 british security services colluded in the unlawful detention and facilitated the interrogation of a uk resident detained in pakistan six years ago the high court ruled today two judges ordered the foreign secretary to hand over to binyam mohameds legal team secret information that could support his case that he was tortured in pakistan and morocco before being sent to guantanamo bay
6662802 hes the guy weve got a lot of confidence in to give the ball
6662803 his inconsistencies right now are nowhere near where they were last year
6662804 theres more things than just looking at two or three relievers and saying hey theyve had some blown saves
6662805 weve had a chance to put some games away and havent been able to do it which would take some pressure off some guys
6662806 a statement from the respondents that it will undertake a review of the terms of the present moa or will renegotiate its terms is not tantamount to a commitment that they will not sign the same
6662807 the slippery slope respondents seek to make this court take will render this court inutile and on a path of irrelevance similar to the path that the martial law court took
6662808 thus any announcement by the respondents that they will desist from signing the moa does not mean that the executive will not desist from signing other agreements of similar terms clearly such action on the part of the executive is capable of repetition
6662809 iasul bacaul si zona moldovei in general atrage din ce in ce mai multe investitii straine ultimele luni ale anului 2007 au adus numai in orasul iasi investitii de peste un miliard de euro bani proveniti de la oameni de afaceri olandezi austrieci francezi italieni si israelieni chiar si multe companii din bucuresti isi deschid sau au intentia de a si deschide aici filiale pentru mana de lucru mai putin costisitoare decat in capitala in acest sens am constatat faptul ca piata de evenimente aflata in crestere in ultimii ani va deveni din ce in ce mai interesanta pentru mult mai multi oameni de afaceri unii spun ca organizarea de evenimente si relatiile publice in general sunt un moft pentru companiile cu experienta care se orienteaza acum catre aceasta zona a tarii au devenit deja de mult timp o necesitate acest lucru va incuraja probabil si alte companii din aceasta zona a tarii sa se indrepte spre acest gen de servicii
6662810 avem incredere ca intr un an piata de organizare evenimente in zona moldovei va cunoaste un boom ambele orase si iasi si bacau implinesc in acest an 600 de ani de atestare documentara iar numarul de evenimente organizate in 2008 ne incurajeaza sa credem ca am luat decizia cea mai buna facand acest pas de aceea suntem pregatiti si am creat o echipa profesionista de lucru pentru a r spunde potentialului pe care il estimam in prezent
6662811 am decis sa facem acest pas deoarece internetul ne a adus cele mai mari vanzari in 2007 spune managing partner ul aiko

6662833 its unusual to be asked what we are going to do ahead of a rate cut but on what we know today this is a pretty simple equation anz chief executive mike smith said today
6662834 if funding costs continue at the current levels and the reserve bank do actually cut rates then there will be a full flow on to our mortgage customers
6662835 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down he said
6662836 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision

6662846 is he a batter or a pitcher and is he big in your country
6662847 its pretty humbling isnt it for an old fisherman and surfer in queensland who now and then plays a bit of cricket
6662848 its an amazing achievement and to be mentioned is something im very proud about and i cant believe he even said that
6662849 just to see him dance and carry on is truly inspirational and for him to have me in his mind is just so humbling
6662850 imagine waking up in the morning and someone asks what do you for a gig mate

6662852 they love their cricket and jamaica is full of cricketers who weve enjoyed over the years and he can definitely come out and say gday anytime he likes
6662853 he obviously loves cricket and its so healthy to know i can be here and he can be there and we can mutually enjoy each others sports

6662904 this is sad for u s softball because our expectations were so high
6662905 but at the same time im an olympic silver medalist and not many people can say that
6662906 i saw the runner going home out of the corner of my eye and i guess i rushed a little bit didnt make as good a throw as i could have
6662907 you train your whole life for this you want to win as for the big picture i havent really thought about it thats something ill do in the future for right now it is what it seems to be

6662911 if it doesnt work out you look like the dumb rookie but if it does work youre a hero
6662912 we won the gold medal and no one even knows half our names
6662913 i mean im still kind of in shock right now
6662914 never in my wildest dreams would i have thought that id score the goal to get us the olympic gold
6662915 for them to look over and see that that has to be exhausting
6662916 i realized i needed to look at things positively and view it as an opportunity
6662917 i wanted to change a few things and that gave me the chance
6662918 its something ive thought about doing but i didnt feel like it was the right time to do it while i was trying to win games in the big leagues
6662919 when i keep my hands low it keeps my head focused on the catchers glove a lot better than the other way
6662920 i went down and i threw 85 90 percent strikes and 55 percent of my pitches were off speed so im pleased with it and looking forward to seeing what i can do with it up here

6662927 why then arent we the leaders of energy and medical conventions
6662928 its a major coup for the city its validation and recognition that houston is a great tourist destination
6662929 it is about the fact that not just the people of springfield but so many millions of viewers of the simpsons are so resistant to change and the introduction of something really unique and entirely plausible that something deep down inside them is offended
6662930 the charges relate to the repeated sexual assault of a former altar boy on the states south coast
6662931 police will allege the offences occurred over a period from 1969 to 1976 commencing when the victim was 10 years old
6662932 if you want to give the murray darling basin a fighting chance then compulsory acquisition obviously on just terms is the way to get things done
6662933 what the government needs to know is that this is the biggest issue facing my state they can expect me to be absolutely determined to get a fair result for my state
6662934 but were talking about a system now that has been grossly over allocated and unless we do something were not going to be able to save that system
6662935 ive got a lot of members here in victoria that think thats the way to go
6662936 i get a lot of people that say to me you know why not why not just take a hit and thats it
6662937 its a tough golf course i thought if you shoot in the red all week in the 60s all week youll have something at the end there
6662938 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
6662939 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
6662940 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
6662941 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
6662942 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
6662943 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in and how about the men why not bring in compulsory lycra bike pants instead of the baggy shorts many men wear currently
6662944 im sure our female audience would appreciate it and dont forget the umpires and referees a little black and white striped skintight number with sequins would surely boost ratings
6662945 if every agent was prosecuted for what john talia has done there would be hundreds of real estate agents in prison with him today
6662946 this is one of the most common crimes in real estate
6662947 it will have dodgy real estate agents all over australia quivering in their shoes tonight
6662948 you cheated two vulnerable people of the large part of the real value of an elderly mans home
6662949 its a terrific outcome today because this sort of behaviour is completely unacceptable and thats why we terminated his agreement
6662950 anyone who takes unfair advantage of a client irrespective of what business they are in should expect to face the consequences
6662951 we have asked the gymastics federation to look into what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepencies on this subject
6662952 with usain in it its going to be an awesome race
6662953 he set the bar so high now everyone wants a gold medal
6662954 this is certainly a serious blow to the sport and we are well aware of the possible implications for the sport and its position in the olympics
6662955 hes up and running and will be touch and go but if he gets the all clear hes ready to go hes making steady progress
6662956 the instance with anthony is the classical one that if were fortunate enough to make it and go through the finals series youd like to think that at some stage if its too late for him to play vfl and theyre not in the finals then its all done on the training track theyre the downsides
6662957 as much as it is a concern its not the be all and end all that you dont or do play a bloke
6662958 you can still fit a lot of work into people on the training track
6662959 they obviously lack match practice but you try to simulate that with players that are left over and hopefully get something from that
6662960 hes got a team that has performed very well playing a certain role for five or six years
6662961 so if theyre changing their game plan or strategies because of us weve achieved something that not many other sides have been able to achieve that sydney changes their game plan
6662962 well just have to see weve got to take into consideration all sorts of scenarios
6662963 there might be a few different structural things weve pretty much played the same plan weve had in previous seasons so there might be a few things he roos might change
6662964 it wont be massive change i think it will really be determined on whether we turn up to play or not that will be the biggest factor on the result
6662965 this is truly an international solution for an international city that enhances the gold coasts reputation as a tourism and lifestyle destination
6662966 by making public transport faster more efficient and more reliable this project is estimated to take up to 40 000 car trips off the roads
6662967 it doesnt detail when they are going to build it how much it is going to cost and who is going to build it
6662968 when you put them through narrow streets like they are attempting to do through southport and surfers paradise you are just going to have traffic chaos you are not going to relieve any traffic
6662969 we have a number of banks that are still under investigation and we are obviously having conversations about resolution the one thing the people want is their money back quickly
6662970 i think its another case of the subordinates going to jail while the supervisors get away
6662971 but we have no regrets we fought the government and won nine out of the 10 charges in a fair trial
6662972 i think it will send a signal to the marketplace that people should be listening to

6662975 while it is great that children are given this financial start in life it is not fair that children born today will get 145 less after inflation than their predecessors in the course of the scheme
6662976 if you forecast the difference over the childs 18 years the government could be looking at a shortfall of over 97 million a year for newborn babies

6662978 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing

6662980 the share of revenue generated from multi year contracts has increased we will also be able to sign off a number of long lasting project proposals in contracts in the second half the ebita margin was under pressure during the first half of this year costs incurred for project proposals start up and running expenses of a few large projects as well as hiring more contractors were important contributing factors the loss of robeco direct as a client has a negative impact on the revenue and profit development in the coming period additionally we will lower our cost levels
6662981 by accelerating our enterprise growth and executing well across the portfolio hp delivered a strong third quarter performance our global position broad product and services offerings and incremental cost saving opportunities make us confident that well continue to meaningfully expand earnings
6662982 it always makes me laugh when people say is she isnt she its like eventually you will know so just chill out for a minute
6662983 been through it its all good its great im really excited

6662986 these shocking acts of cruelty against koalas their joeys and birds must be stopped and the only way to stop them is to catch the perpetrators and ensure they receive the maximum penalties for cruelty
6662987 were happy to talk to them about potential relationships with our sponsors but weve made it clear there cant be any exceptions to the salary cap rules
6662988 were just introducing him to our sponsors which is really the only measure we can do
6662989 sometimes there are sponsors willing to get on board with them but its very important that we dont make an exception to the rules
6662990 theres potentially an opportunity to do that next year but we need to look at the overall budget before we agree to that

6663025 this season shows that you should never give up there were some races where things didnt go well for one reason or another but i was able to collect some precious points
6663026 my position after hungary is better than it was before the race we havent lost anything but we need to get better results consistently
6663027 from now on every single race will be extremely important and every single point will have a great value the fewer there are the more important they become
6663028 i think the championship will be very tight but i need to have at least one point more than my competitors after the last race this is the sole aim the rest is just details
6663029 we need to score a decent return of points whenever we can and be consistent and as competitive as we can
6663030 this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions
6663031 thats made getting strong results even more important so i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
6663032 we still feel confident about our chances we know our rivals will be strong but weve worked hard to improve the car and were confident well be competitive this weekend
6663033 the most important thing is to finish consistently in the points
6663034 ive only seen the new track from an on board camera and it seems to be very fast for a street circuit
6663035 i always love to drive on new tracks and im always very quick to know them i cant wait to race at valencia
6663036 it will be more important than in other places to drive with continuity from friday on qualifying will be extremely important although i think there are some possibilities to overtake
6663037 if its hot that will help ferrari like at montreal you also need a bit of luck
6663038 we launched the vodafone mclaren mercedes team here at the start of 2007 and ive tested at the ricardo tormo circuit so the city isnt unfamiliar to me
6663039 going to a new circuit doesnt really change my preparations everybodys in the same situation so i dont treat things very differently
6663040 i still believe i am improving and learning more about the team and the car at each race
6663041 my aim for the last part of the season is to win more races and to perform regularly at the front
6663042 its something i was able to do from time to time in the first half of the year but i now feel more confident that i can be a consistent challenger in the remaining races
6663043 a project of long term brutal repression is under way
6663044 but we were quickly disillusioned our envoys came up against a wall there was no opening
6663045 real autonomy because we know what chinese style autonomy is a trap
6663046 under this strategy the time hori zon for redeployment would be negotiated with the iraqi government and nested within a more assertive approach to regional diplomacy the united states would make clear that iraq and america share a common interest in achieving sustainable stability in iraq and that the united states is willing to help support the iraqi gov ernment and build its security and governance capacity over the long term but only so long as iraqis continue to make meaningful political progress
6663047 preventing them from acquiring heavy weapons tightly restricting their jurisdictions and movement and closely monitoring them for compliance so that they do not rub up against rival militias
6663048 iraqis of all sectarian and ethnic groups believe that the u s military invasion is the primary root of the violent differences among them and see the departure of occupying forces as the key to national reconciliation
6663049 two of our injuries wykes and brown have occurred during training sessions so they could have happened at any time
6663050 its just the nature of the game that you are going to have injuries from time to time overall ive been delighted with the way the team has conducted itself and the tour will prove to be very beneficial for the team going forward
6663051 were anticipating a full strength northampton team to run out tomorrow which will provide us with yet another good test for our young squad
6663052 the brand of football we have played on this tour has been very positive weve seen some young players come through and put their hand up to remain with the squad for the super 14 season
6663053 weve also worked on developing the leadership of our senior players and they have responded well with the extra responsibility
6663054 although candida species remain a relevant cause of ifi invasive fungal infection other organisms particularly moulds have become increasingly prevalent
6663055 in particular aspergillus species are the leading cause of mould infections although other other moulds including fusarium species and zygomycetes are increasing in frequency and are associated with a high mortality rate

6663058 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6663059 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6663060 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6663061 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

6663075 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6663076 american influence over european political and security institutions well into the future
6663077 the investigations found that all the mis are either insolvent on a cash flow basis a balance sheet basis or on the basis of the accounts kept by pwl have no assets or liabilities deloittes said today
6663078 further mis involving the growing of grapes would require members to pay more funds than they are likely to receive in revenue for the remainder of those mis
6663079 as a result none of the mis have the working capital required to continue to operate and the administrators are not aware of anyone who would be willing to contribute sufficient working capital to resolve the situation
6663080 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6663081 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6663082 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6663083 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6663084 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6663085 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6663086 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6663087 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6663088 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6663089 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6663090 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6663091 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6663092 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6663093 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6663094 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6663095 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6663096 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6663097 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6663098 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6663099 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6663100 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6663101 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6663102 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6663103 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6663104 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6663105 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6663106 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6663107 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6663108 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6663109 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6663110 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6663111 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6663112 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6663113 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6663114 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6663115 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

6663119 im so glad i can represent and be a part of it mikey and donny and me its huge for american bmx think about it thisll bring a big boost to our program it puts us on the map again
6663120 and kind of showed everyone that the sport is really awesome
6663121 how is that talk about stuff flying all over the track everywhere
6663122 people were going for broke so i was patient i waited i avoided all the problems and there it was

6663130 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6663131 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6663132 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6663133 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6663134 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6663135 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6663136 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6663137 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6663138 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6663139 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6663140 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6663141 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6663142 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6663143 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6663144 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6663145 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6663146 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6663147 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6663148 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6663149 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6663150 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6663151 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6663152 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6663153 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6663154 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6663155 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6663156 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6663157 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6663158 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6663159 who are open to doing something on the production side
6663160 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6663161 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6663162 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

6663175 there are traditions all over the arab world of women cross dressing at women only performances and weddings for the hilarious amusement of other women
6663176 and cross dressing by children is harmless fantasy and transgressive fun as they think about gender

6663178 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6663179 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6663180 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6663181 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

6663190 hanya dalam suatu kerumunanlah baca kelompok manusia akan merasa dirinya bebas dari persentuhan dengan orang lain dan bebas berbuat apa saja yang ia inginkan kerumunanlah satu satunya situasi di mana ketakutan berubah menjadi kebalikannya keberanian kerumunan yang ia kehendaki adalah kerumunan yang solid yang membuat tubuh saling bersentuhan sedemikian rupa sehingga ia tak lagi sadar siapa yang menyentuh dirinya dan siapa yang ia sentuh segera setelah ia menyerahkan dirinya pada kerumunan maka ia kehilangan rasa takut itu

6663225 it is very important thing that my mother likes the music
6663226 most of my musical touchstones are from my youth i remember a beatles and the beach boys compilation tape before that the shadows man of mystery 7 played loud on 45rpm
6663227 we enjoyed our time together and played more together with our five piece when recording ghost is not real
6663228 its more of a live album than the first one something that is cooked up especially to sound great live
6663229 life shows us so much beauty if we are open
6663230 a very beautiful contrast between things safe and frightening all at the same time but everything is not what it seems
6663231 we did a radio live on bbc a couple of years ago
6663232 the studio was a place with plenty of history the energies were strong there jimi hendrix and all kinds of legends had performed in that space last summer time was quite intense we played the glastonbury festival when it rained like crazy we had a great time and the audiences really loved it but a year later were still scratching mud from our equipment
6663233 music is taking over day by day and still feels magical
6663234 at the moment i feel like ive wrestled a bear but i kind of hear how the next album should sound now so it was worth it
6663235 im super pleased because i have the possibility to produce more music the music has found me i am going to stay with this relationship
6663236 one of my dreams is coming true in the forthcoming year im composing the music to a feature film thats inspiring

6663240 they also recovered a suicide jacket from a nearby mosque and seized explosives
6663241 i looked back and saw the limbs of my colleagues flying through the air
6663242 we shut the factory for a day to mourn this tragedy in which 67 people died
6663243 the army has killed hundreds of innocent people and we attacked it to teach it a lesson
6663244 even if you have to sit together for a week

6663251 prior to this the negaraku had been toyed with and now there are people suggesting that the jalur gemilang be flown upside down we must take action to teach those intending to fool around with the countrys symbols a lesson
6663252 there has never been a single piece of drm restricted media that cant be downloaded from the internet today in more than a decade of extensive use drm has never once accomplished its goal
6663253 drm exacts a terrible cost to the public to performs and authors to educators and cultural institution and it delivers nothing in return drm is a system for delivering less freedom to performers and authors and the public while charging more it is all cost no dividend
6663254 drm systems create an unprecedented difficulty for consumers because they give entertainment companies and drm vendors the ability to eliminate the very features that caused consumers to buy their wares in the first place this system invites abusive practices whereby consumers can be tricked into buying technology they would otherwise pass over due to its restrictiveness

6663266 the fires notoriously raucous supporters group section 8 was relatively quiet in the first 45 minutes the silence was part of a protest against monterrey security which section 8 is accusing of racist behavior toward hispanic fans
6663267 the purpose of the work was not to cause any type of infliction on the poor innocent creature but rather to illustrate a point thousands of stray dogs starve and die of illness each year in the streets and no one pays them a second thought

6663281 devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life which one believes to be the best in the world but has no wish to force upon other people
6663282 nobody can suppose that it is not more beneficial to a breton or a basque of french navarre to be brought into the current of the ideas and feelings of a highly civilized and cultivated people to be a member of the french nationality admitted on equal terms to all the privileges of french citizenship sharing the advantages of french protection and the dignity and prestige of french power than to sulk on his own rocks the half savage relic of past times revolving in his own little mental orbit without participation or interest in the general movement of the world the same remark applies to the welshman or the scottish highlander as members of the british nation
6663283 c ompanies such as transform and the harley medical group present the acquisition of fake breasts as being a consumer choice comparable to the purchase of a new car or a sofa with pay by instalment price plans to boot
6663284 we need to start loving ourselves a little more and stop worshipping dumb assed celebrities who mutilate their breasts in the name of vanity
6663285 only a day before the announcement by british gas that household bills would rise by a third the wholesale gas price fell off a cliff
6663286 john riggio r i g g i o were going to find you and snuff you out like a going to catch you and pull you out whatever it takes to shut this gun store down were gonna snuff out john riggio
6663287 were gonna snuff out legislators who are against our gun laws
6663288 publicly delivering a threat against anyones life betrays the civil order and is morally outrageous especially if this threat came from a priest
6663289 friends and advisors such as the rev michael pfleger who has known obama for the better part of 20 years help him keep that moral compass set he obama says
6663290 i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against

6663302 it is well known that if you sing to plants they grow better so its not hard to see how music crops and oil that i have personally blessed can come together to relieve world hunger

6663317 its awesome playing in front of your home crowd and it was a gorgeous round the kind you plan on paper and it actually works out
6663318 i gather that 140 tibetans were killed although the figure needs to be confirmed
6663319 since the riots in march reliable witnesses have established that 400 people have been killed in the lhasa area alone if you consider the whole of tibet the number of victims is obviously higher
6663320 we know about disturbances in the kham region but we do not have any details or figures about injuries or deaths
6663321 nor do we have any exact dates for the disturbances
6663322 ten thousand people have been arrested since march we dont know where they are being held
6663323 the military presence in tibet is old but the frenzy of new construction in the amdo and kham regions makes me say that this colonisation by the army is designed to last
6663324 this is our reply for the killing of women and children in bajaur near the afghan border by pakistan army bombs
6663325 we will launch bigger attacks in all major pakistani cities
6663326 the system proposed for poland and the czech republic doesnt exist has never been tested and has no demonstrated effectiveness to defend europe or the u s under realistic operational conditions
6663327 for these reasons the u s bmd system proposed for europe is causing strife with russia for nothing
6663328 there is huge demand for mobile applications from consumers who make up the vast majority of the mobile phone population

6663341 on third downs if we ever go into a three receiver set and he gets in there he is the guy that they have to cover and that is not an easy task for any nickel guy
6663342 he understands what we are trying to get done and he understands the defenses and where the openings are at
6663343 i do not think we should be buying sbi not even as bargain hunting as a trader as an investor this is probably a good opportunity to slowly accumulate if sbi falls 200 points more then one should buy a little more that is a different issue altogether but for trading it is like catching falling knives
6663344 tata steel has that very significant support at which it is standing now for investors it is not necessary also to make a call on the lowest point of the market or the stock so at this point tata steel is a buying opportunity if one wants to invest rs one lakh in tata steel then one should go and invest rs 10 000 20 000 now
6663345 for the other steel stocks there is jindal pack jsw jindal saw there are buying opportunities there for investors for jindal saw i would say that a dip is also an opportunity for a trader so steel does represent buying opportunities i would not go and short steel anyway
6663346 this is a game between two great football programs which both have a lot of tradition and respect for one another
6663347 ralston likes to run the football and we like to option and throw it so it should be an interesting clash of styles
6663348 when two very good teams play its all about fundamentals and not making mistakes
6663349 both teams have had a week less to prepare but going up there will be a great measuring stick for our program
6663350 the kids in these programs have played against each other since they were in middle school
6663351 we have a great amount of respect for coach mark buderus and his program
6663352 they were just better than us last season and they put it on us pretty good
6663353 weve never done this week zero thing before so it will be interesting to see what happens
6663354 we think that this will be a good game for our program and we will see where we stand

6663356 capital goods which had a very good run in the last one month is now giving the impression that it is going to go down again so that is a sector that i would stay away from real estate is another sector that has underperformed the rallies were just momentum driven rallies that is a sector that one should go away from
6663357 banks are more pain to come the sectors that i would like is primarily oil amp gas gail ongc cairn and surprisingly that links up with crude somehow but these are stocks that should be bought
6663358 there are short selling opportunities in bpcl and hpcl i would not go and short it because i do not trade in all of these stocks that is a different issue but there are opportunities in the real estate sector real estate is one area where the concept of sell on rallies remains valid because much lower levels are likely
6663359 negotiations are tough and sometimes they are even tougher than usual
6663360 the process of signing players sometimes takes time but fans should be aware we are trying to strengthen up front and sign a new forward
6663361 quite often these things take time but we have a list of targets that we are working very hard on
6663362 its true to say we have one or two areas that we need to look at defensively and maybe solve a few problems at the back
6663363 tottenham fans are no exception to any others if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like
6663364 while he is still here he is very much 100 per cent a tottenham player that is how we consider things
6663365 we maintain our fy 2009e and fy 2010e at rs 22 and rs 30 and roll over our price target to fy 2010e currently the stock is quoting at 8 9x fy09e and 6 5x fy10e we continue to rate the stock as a buy with a price target of rs 270 based on 9x fy 2010e
6663366 we are not that positive on idea and the overall telecom pack idea would start making money in mumbai circle only after three four years i think that also is a bit negative for the stock and whatever trigger was there because of this launch should have been utilised by the people to exit to stock we do not expect this stock to go beyond rs 94 95 levels
6663367 cloud computing is one of those catch all buzz words that tries to encompass a variety of aspects ranging from deployment load balancing provisioning business model and architecture like web2
6663368 i view cloud computing as a broad array of web based services aimed at allowing users to obtain a wide range of functional capabilities on a pay as you go basis that previously required tremendous hardware software investments and professional skills to acquire cloud computing is the realization of the earlier ideals of utility computing without the technical complexities or complicated deployment worries
6663369 i think clouds are the next hype term for the next year or two people are coming to grips with virtualization and how it reshapes it creates service and software based models and in many ways changes a lot of the physical layer we are used to clouds will be the next transformation over the next several years building off of the software models that virtualization enabled
6663370 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6663371 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6663372 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together

6663381 vice president dick cheney was even more pointed telling georgian president saakashvili on sunday afternoon that
6663382 the sabbatines were aggressive toward the mission and are well trained
6663383 they operate fast and are deliberate with their actions but remain cognizant of adjacent units
6663384 shows the community that iraqis are taking control and not allowing insurgents into the area
6663385 operations like this assist in the transfer to provincial iraqi control
6663386 the sabbatines were greeted warmly by the iraqi citizens during the operation and you could tell there was a great deal of faith and respect
6663387 the majority of republicans believe the party platform on abortion needs to change and demonstrates that a socially moderate vice presidential running mate would make the gop ticket more electable
6663388 in an attempt to make something stick barack obama has re aired his dirty laundry with convicted felon tony rezko that led to a highly questionable land deal rezkos dirty dealings are well documented and his relationship with barack obama goes back 20 years
6663389 we still dont have answers about sen obama and his dealings with mr rezko
6663390 i dont want any part of our conversation to be improper
6663391 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6663392 now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6663393 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6663394 what people are going through every single day here in america
6663395 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6663396 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6663397 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6663398 maybe youre struggling just to pay the mortgage on your home
6663399 then again that same day when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember well its seven seven houses
6663400 and heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6663401 from my perspective obama needs to introduce a game changer and fast before public opinion starts to gel around the notion that he is a phenom who deserves great respect but is not seasoned enough and would be too much of a risk in the oval office
6663402 we are here today to express our admiration for you to tell the whole world that we want it to know the truth about the horrible events in tskhinvali
6663403 we have a presence of so called russian peacekeepers in key georgian choke points that will control economic life that will control humanitarian activities
6663404 it raises the question whether this is an effort to strangle the georgian state

6663409 weve seen the domination of just a couple of issues surround the christian voice in politics
6663410 we wanted a christian voice that better reflected the gospel values missing from the landscape
6663411 for hispanic evangelicals this is something deep in the heart
6663412 people like myself get a lot of attention when we talk about issues like abortion and family life but not when we talk about helping low income people
6663413 matthew 25 gives us the opportunity to try to get candidates to focus on these concerns
6663414 the issues people pray about before they go to bed at night arent those divisive issues republicans have raised
6663415 they pray about their son or daughter being overseas or how theyll take care of their nursing bills or whether their son can go to college
6663416 everyone in the network is focused on reducing the number of abortions and thats where senator obamas focus is along with emphasizing personal responsibility fatherhood and having the courage to raise a child
6663417 catholics reflect on this and get to know more about him
6663418 a nation that kills its own children is a nation without hope
6663419 there is incredible enthusiasm for barack obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
6663420 we can assure our supporters these texts did not come from the campaign and their data is secure everyone can also rest easy that despite their popularity mickey mouse and michael phelps are not on the short list at this time
6663421 now even if tim kaine himself tells me hes vp i think ill keep my mouth shut
6663422 we are proud to help cause confusion and excitement during this terrible boring week of no news at all
6663423 but we cant really take too much credit for it apparently one of our readers listens to howard stern which is still on the radio and heard of the veep txt hoax and figured out an easy way to do it through verizons txt website
6663424 so many of my so called friends have sent hoax texts to me now
6663425 tough budgetary decisions must be made now in order to ensure a financially healthy agency next fiscal year
6663426 its only going to be a short amount of time before a new budget gets through and the congress is committed to moving peace corps in an upward direction
6663427 it is my goal to see a growing number of highly qualified diverse and determined americans of all ages committing themselves to serve our country as peace corps volunteers
6663428 achieving this goal will require a strong nationwide recruiting presence
6663429 if we dont make a change you will have a total of between 36 to 38 states that will be voting the first tuesday in february in 2012 by spreading out the primary process into some orderly process benefits the system
6663430 those are the states that you can get retail politics in
6663431 the assumption or proposition that only the small states can you have retail politics is somewhat misleading and a bit condescending
6663432 the question is how do you fix it in a way that doesnt have unintended consequences
6663433 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
6663434 the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6663435 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6663436 words in that draft led some to misconstrue the departments intent
6663437 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience
6663438 this regulation does not seek to resolve any ambiguity in that area it focuses on abortion and focuses on physicians conscience in relation to that
6663439 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research activity
6663440 we think its badly needed our members are facing discrimination every day and as we get into human cloning and all sorts of possibilities its going to become even more important
6663441 there is nothing in this rule that would in any way change a patients right to a legal procedure
6663442 participating in any activity with a reasonable connection to the objectionable procedure including referrals training and other arrangements for offending procedures
6663443 arming syria would lead to a strategic change and could destabilize the middle east and the world
6663444 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which do not violate the regional balance of power
6663445 why in the world would we need to deploy our missiles in syria against whom we have no enemies in the region
6663446 we understand russias stance regarding the breakaway regions and understand that it came in retaliation to georgian provocation
6663447 the timing of assads visit is very important it happens at the time when russia is very angry at the united states
6663448 it is highly possible that russia being so angered by the west and the united states now may sell something very nasty to syria
6663449 an er visit for something thats not an emergency costs the medical center 1 200
6663450 thats sucking up dollars in health care that we dont all have to just blow through carelessly
6663451 michelle inspired us to step back and take a holistic approach to this problem

6663453 but the work of civil rights broadly the whole fight for the rights of the individual will continue
6663454 the largest challenge facing jesse is in a day when you have a barack in government and there are players like sharpton in civil rights are you still relevant
6663455 part of his relevance is that some of the new players out there people like me he helped mentor the question now is does he play the elder statesman in terms of living through them
6663456 talking with dr king reading the bible and talking with myself
6663457 i wanted to see if there was a gap between my heart and my lip
6663458 it was not meant to publicly embarrass him because i had shared the message with him before
6663459 he gave the deputy a florida drivers license that had been suspended in may 2008
6663460 i came here for the gold medal silvers great but i came here for the gold
6663461 i thought it should have been 1 1 a point for each but thats the way it went
6663462 when youre fighting koreans you have to go over and beyond to beat them and i guess i didnt do that today
6663463 its their sport sometimes they get their way theyre one of the best and every time you face korea they are a formidable opponent and i respect that it was a great match
6663464 after all the sacrifice and all the hard work i wasnt going home without a medal
6663465 above everything im here at the olympic games with my family i cant overlook that its been a great ride and its not over yet
6663466 he should be in the finals its unfortunate that we had to compete in the first round
6663467 vindicated i feel great i feel amazing i just won a gold medal
6663468 it was hard and this win wasnt just down to my goal
6663469 it was only achievable with the team we have and that we played for each other
6663470 i know it sounds crazy but im glad i went though it
6663471 this is such a reward for nine months of hard hard work and soul searching after the world cup
6663472 obviously you have to find a way to bowl some dots against him and build a bit of pressure because he is one of the worlds best if not the best at the moment
6663473 he has got all the shots and new ones i see it as a challenge because no one else out there does it so i would like to see what i do if he does it
6663474 we have had a few chats and some of the senior guys have an idea what i should do
6663475 if he moves late you cannot do anything if the ball has already left your hand
6663476 if he does move early you maybe could pull out but i suppose it is also a good opportunity for a wicket if you get it right if he is totally turning around then his head is moving but you have to acknowledge he has done it well so far i have seen him five to 10 times and he has never failed
6663477 if we can set it up early and take a lead i am sure the confidence should take us through to the end and we can win the series
6663478 during that period i had to really think about my bowling and be really on my game so that if something didnt feel right with my bowling i knew what it was
6663479 that helped me to groove my action and feel my action a bit more so i can work it out if something goes wrong
6663480 every guy out there is just a big kid at heart and being a big brother lets you act like a kid again
6663481 her addiction to illicit drugs is the explanation for her involvement
6663482 one of her young children was a potential prosecution witness in this case
6663483 today the federal district court granted a stay of execution in the case of jeff wood to allow the court to consider compelling evidence that jeff wood is too mentally ill to be executed
6663484 at reneaus trial the prosecution had argued that reneau was the person chiefly responsible for the crime and that woods role was secondary

6663486 the boomerang should be returned to kurnell as a symbol of that first meeting and so all australians have the opportunity to see it
6663487 having the boomerang back in kurnell will be an historic symbol of harmony between our two cultures and will help teach young australians about the importance of aboriginal culture he said

6663521 he wants to win were in practice with the select team and we dont even have the scoreboard on and he wants to keep score hes hungry because this is something that he wants to put on his resume that he doesnt have
6663522 his popularity is probably the no 1 athlete out here
6663523 it has been unbelievable to see how big he is as an athlete
6663524 i think its because of basketball of course but i think a lot of it is his personality also
6663525 he tried to have a tough exterior like a shield to fit in
6663526 he was a good kid who was dealt some bad cards in life
6663527 it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school
6663528 i want to assure parents and others in this community that despite this tragic and isolated incident that our schools are safe

6663535 is not a law for the purposes of official misconduct and thus his act contrary to article viii section 1 a did not
6663536 indictment must at a minimum allege facts that would show defendant violated an identifiable statute rule regulation or tenet of a professional code and demonstrate how defendant exceeded his lawful authority
6663537 no conduct constitutes an offense unless it is described as an offense in this code or in another statute of this state
6663538 the illinois constitution is not a criminal code in and of itself nor is it part of the illinois criminal code but rather it represents a framework for and a limitation on state governmental powers and accordingly the states reliance on it to bootstrap a criminal violation is misplaced and the three constitutional indictments must fail
6663539 a conviction for official misconduct can be predicated on acts not specifically described in the code
6663540 a n arrest occurs when the circumstances are such that a reasonable person innocent of any crime would conclude that he was not free to leave
6663541 reasonable person standard to consider whether a reasonable juvenile would have thought that his freedom of movement was restricted
6663542 analysis did not end there because defendants initial voluntary presence at the police station does not negate the possibility that subsequent police conduct was unlawful
6663543 defendants voluntary presence at the police station escalated into an involuntary seizure in violation of defendants fourth amendment rights
6663544 first whether defendants handwritten statement was voluntary under the fifth amendment protection against self incrimination such that the defendant understood the miranda warnings and felt he had a legitimate choice to exercise them and second whether for fourth amendment purposes the handwritten statement was sufficiently attenuated to purge the taint of the defendants illegal arrest
6663545 if the fifth amendment has been violated the fourth amendment issue would not have to be reached
6663546 w e must first determine whether the detectives deliberately used a question first warn later technique when interrogating defendant
6663547 although the detective claimed that defendant was not a suspect he nevertheless testified that defendant would not have been free to leave the police station at 6 p m after the incriminating statement had been obtained
6663548 unwarned and warned statements were taken close in time in the same place with the same detective present for both and defendant was never advised that his oral statement would be inadmissible we cannot conclude that a reasonable juvenile in defendants position would have understood that he had a genuine choice about whether to continue talking to the police
6663549 whether defendants confession was obtained through exploitation of his illegal arrest under the fourth amendment
6663550 the findings of this study highlight the importance of childhood dietary patterns as determinants of later obesity there is a need to reinforce initiatives which develop positive dietary habits at a young age especially the value of eating fruit and vegetables
6663551 the legislature clearly intended that the age of the victim not be subject to a mental state and that this rendered the mistake of age defense unavailable for the offense of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child
6663552 the accused commits predatory criminal sexual assault of a child if the accused was 17 years of age or over and commits an act of sexual penetration with a victim who was under 13 years of age when the act was committed
6663553 i f the statute defining an offense prescribe s a particular mental state with respect to the offense as a whole without distinguishing among the elements thereof the prescribed mental state applies to each such element if the statute does not prescribe a particular mental state applicable to an element of an offense any mental state defined in sections 4 4 4 5 or 4 6 is applicable
6663554 t he offense of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child has one voluntary act element and two attendant circumstances elements
6663555 while section 4 3 b includes recklessness as a mental state recklessness does not make any sense when applied to the act of sexual penetration
6663556 the attendant circumstances of section 12 14 1 a 1 are at the time of the offense 1 the accused is 17 years of age or older and 2 the victim is under 13 years of age these circumstances do not require any mental state they need only be established
6663557 i t shall be a defense under those sections that the accused reasonably believed the person to be 17 years of age or over
6663558 gave rise to the inference that the mistake of age defense is not available for any other sexual offenses specifying the age of the victim
6663559 n ever has any court in illinois held that a mistake of age is a defense to a sexual act with a child under 13 years of age likewise all courts that have considered the issue in published opinions have held that there is no mental state associated with the victims age element and that accordingly there is no mistake of age defense available to an accused
6663560 the act of sexual penetration is a knowing or intentional act the offender should be held to be aware enough of the potential liability associated with the act to avoid engaging in sexual relations with young children
6663561 if it allowed a mistake of age defense the defense would strip the victims of the protection which the law exists to afford public policy requires it unless defendants were made to determine at their peril whether or not their victims fall within the class peculiarly needing the protection of the law and thus set apart there could be no real protection
6663562 the expunction of records of arrest only for persons not having previously been convicted of any criminal offense or municipal ordinance violation t he language of the act was clearly meant to refer to the time of the filing of the petition to expunge and to grant persons not convicted prior to such filing the right to expunction
6663563 whenever an adult or minor prosecuted as an adult not having previously been convicted of any criminal offense or municipal ordinance violation is acquitted or released without being convicted the chief judge or presiding judge may upon verified petition of the defendant order the record of arrest expunged from the official records
6663564 not having previously been convicted of any criminal offense or municipal ordinance violation

6663566 a court analyzes the reasonableness of a traffic stop under the principles of terry v ohio 392 u s 1 1968 thus consistent with terry if a law enforcement officer has knowledge of sufficient articulable facts at the time of the encounter to create a reasonable suspicion that the person in question has committed or is about to commit a crime the officer may briefly stop and detain the person to make reasonable inquiries while the facts supporting the officers suspicions need not rise to the level of probable cause they must be based on more than a mere hunch

6663577 the problem with the presumption that the owner was the driver is that it eliminates the presumption of innocence and shifts the burden of proof from that required by the rules of criminal procedure this violates the rule in hoben that an ordinance cannot provide less procedural protection to the person charged than would be available if the person were charged under the act
6663578 williams was taking money and cocaine from his pocket so he grabbed her throat and continued squeezing until she was dead
6663579 trial court failed to inform the defendant that he would be required to serve a 3 year period of msr in addition to his 45 year sentence
6663580 there were possibly some errors made during the plea bargain and we need to review the record to insure mr bumpers justice
6663581 petition was untimely and defendant failed to show that the delay was not due to defendants culpable negligence
6663582 provides a tool by which those under criminal sentence can assert that their convictions were the result of a substantial denial of their rights under the united states constitution or the illinois constitution or both
6663583 if a defendant does not file a direct appeal the post conviction petition shall be filed no later than 3 years from the date of the conviction unless the petitioner alleges facts showing that the delay was not due to his or her culpable negligence
6663584 defendant stated in an affidavit submitted to the trial court that he began pursuing his post conviction petition in august 2003 three months before the deadline to file a timely post conviction petition but was unable to obtain his sentencing transcripts the record shows that in august 2003 defendant filed a pro se motion requesting a copy of his trial record the affidavit of defendants father describes the multiple attempts he made to request transcripts of defendants proceedings first in august 2000 defendants father was told that there were no transcripts because it was a plea later in july 2004 he was told he could request them but needed to pay 60 00 to do so in august 2004 he then returned with the money and ordered defendants transcripts which would take two weeks to complete defendant mailed his post conviction petition to the trial court approximately three months after he received the transcripts
6663585 was not culpably negligent in filing his post conviction petition a year after the statutorily imposed deadline
6663586 sought to enforce the bargained terms of his plea agreement by reducing his sentence from 25 years imprisonment with the added 3 year term of msr to 22 years imprisonment with the added 3 year term of msr
6663587 resulted in a sentence more onerous than the one defendant agreed to at the time of the plea hearing
6663588 addition of the msr constituted an unfair breach of the plea agreement
6663589 a more onerous sentence than that to which he plead guilty
6663590 1 the promise must be fulfilled or 2 the defendant must be given the opportunity to withdraw his plea

6663605 the instance with anthony is the classical one that if were fortunate enough to make it and go through the finals series youd like to think that at some stage if its too late for him to play vfl and theyre not in the finals then its all done on the training track theyre the downsides
6663606 as much as it is a concern its not the be all and end all that you dont or do play a bloke
6663607 you can still fit a lot of work into people on the training track
6663608 they obviously lack match practice but you try to simulate that with players that are left over and hopefully get something from that
6663609 hes got a team that has performed very well playing a certain role for five or six years

6663615 sometimes there are sponsors willing to get on board with them but its very important that we dont make an exception to the rules

6663629 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
6663630 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
6663631 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
6663632 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
6663633 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in and how about the men why not bring in compulsory lycra bike pants instead of the baggy shorts many men wear currently
6663634 im sure our female audience would appreciate it and dont forget the umpires and referees a little black and white striped skintight number with sequins would surely boost ratings
6663635 its been huge for us to have oswalt turn it around the way that he has
6663636 going into wednesdays game we had the third best record in baseball since the all star break if you look at that stretch it by and large coincides with roys streak
6663637 you can run off five or six or seven in a row and youll be right up there with the leaders in the league as far as the win column but as far as wins its always more a plus than individual stuff but i feel like if i im winning im helping the team
6663638 i wasnt worried about him turning around for the simple fact that he is such a competitor and he wants to win so badly
6663639 even when he lost he still threw the ball well he just gave up that blooper when theres a man on base to score or somehow a guy ran into a pitch for a homer it wasnt like he truly ever struggled
6663640 i felt decent to pretty good at the beginning of the year but as far as results the results are a little better now
6663641 it doesnt really matter how you feel but if you go out there and throw quality starts together usually youre going to win
6663642 young guys have a chance to learn from them and the veterans in the rotation want to step up and do their part too when you have at least one guy in your rotation like that thats a boost to your team
6663643 anytime he comes out i know we all feel like its a game we can win
6663644 i dont think theres any question that roy was going to be the roy hes always going to be because roy is so competitive
6663645 to me thats more impressive than the fact that he has a nasty curveball and the extra stuff on the heater and all the stuff
6663646 if you lose your game you feel like you let the team down more than if you have some guys with you that can carry the load with you
6663647 its always cool just because its a place i came up to
6663648 i actually made it up through the organization that i was drafted by but its not like i have extra incentive not at all its been so long ago
6663649 i never looked at it as it was kind of a dump as a lot of people say it is
6663650 yeah the first time i ever played there was in the new york penn league we got to play a game there and it was cool
6663651 my first start was with the mets at second base and that will always be special i got my first major league home run and got four hits
6663652 this is truly an international solution for an international city that enhances the gold coasts reputation as a tourism and lifestyle destination
6663653 by making public transport faster more efficient and more reliable this project is estimated to take up to 40 000 car trips off the roads
6663654 it doesnt detail when they are going to build it how much it is going to cost and who is going to build it
6663655 if every agent was prosecuted for what john talia has done there would be hundreds of real estate agents in prison with him today
6663656 this is one of the most common crimes in real estate
6663657 it will have dodgy real estate agents all over australia quivering in their shoes tonight
6663658 you cheated two vulnerable people of the large part of the real value of an elderly mans home
6663659 its a terrific outcome today because this sort of behaviour is completely unacceptable and thats why we terminated his agreement
6663660 anyone who takes unfair advantage of a client irrespective of what business they are in should expect to face the consequences
6663661 again unfortunately this is a koala that has been bashed to death and then after its dead they removed its leg
6663662 the profiles of serious violent criminals overwhelmingly list cruelty to animals before progression to people
6663663 this season shows that you should never give up there were some races where things didnt go well for one reason or another but i was able to collect some precious points
6663664 my position after hungary is better than it was before the race we havent lost anything but we need to get better results consistently
6663665 from now on every single race will be extremely important and every single point will have a great value the fewer there are the more important they become
6663666 i think the championship will be very tight but i need to have at least one point more than my competitors after the last race this is the sole aim the rest is just details
6663667 we need to score a decent return of points whenever we can and be consistent and as competitive as we can
6663668 this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions
6663669 thats made getting strong results even more important so i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
6663670 we still feel confident about our chances we know our rivals will be strong but weve worked hard to improve the car and were confident well be competitive this weekend
6663671 the most important thing is to finish consistently in the points
6663672 ive only seen the new track from an on board camera and it seems to be very fast for a street circuit
6663673 i always love to drive on new tracks and im always very quick to know them i cant wait to race at valencia
6663674 it will be more important than in other places to drive with continuity from friday on qualifying will be extremely important although i think there are some possibilities to overtake
6663675 if its hot that will help ferrari like at montreal you also need a bit of luck
6663676 we launched the vodafone mclaren mercedes team here at the start of 2007 and ive tested at the ricardo tormo circuit so the city isnt unfamiliar to me
6663677 going to a new circuit doesnt really change my preparations everybodys in the same situation so i dont treat things very differently
6663678 i still believe i am improving and learning more about the team and the car at each race
6663679 my aim for the last part of the season is to win more races and to perform regularly at the front
6663680 its something i was able to do from time to time in the first half of the year but i now feel more confident that i can be a consistent challenger in the remaining races
6663681 i would rather have people go out there and hit home runs than walk somebody i hate walks
6663682 i went out to the mound many times to check pitchers injuries but never for a cracked molar we needed a dentist
6663683 that was a little cubbie occurrence e slps that was a first for me first for the umpire
6663684 its not a surprise anymore when he goes out there and pitches like that
6663685 its against detroit next tuesday thats where my focus is
6663686 two of our injuries wykes and brown have occurred during training sessions so they could have happened at any time
6663687 its just the nature of the game that you are going to have injuries from time to time overall ive been delighted with the way the team has conducted itself and the tour will prove to be very beneficial for the team going forward
6663688 were anticipating a full strength northampton team to run out tomorrow which will provide us with yet another good test for our young squad
6663689 the brand of football we have played on this tour has been very positive

6663718 cloud computing is one of those catch all buzz words that tries to encompass a variety of aspects ranging from deployment load balancing provisioning business model and architecture like web2
6663719 i view cloud computing as a broad array of web based services aimed at allowing users to obtain a wide range of functional capabilities on a pay as you go basis that previously required tremendous hardware software investments and professional skills to acquire cloud computing is the realization of the earlier ideals of utility computing without the technical complexities or complicated deployment worries
6663720 i think clouds are the next hype term for the next year or two people are coming to grips with virtualization and how it reshapes it creates service and software based models and in many ways changes a lot of the physical layer we are used to clouds will be the next transformation over the next several years building off of the software models that virtualization enabled

6663724 fijis people need to realise that in going forward as a nation we may have to paddle our canoes on our own
6663725 each one of the us as the citizens of this country must now ask are we going to be bullied and pressured into doing things that are clearly not in our national interest
6663726 if we succumb to such pressures what next what will that do to our self worth as an independent nation
6663727 you all are aware of the high level public posturing by the leaders of the two countries both days before the forum meeting and after they learnt that fiji will not be in the niue meeting
6663728 the pacific island countries will need to be vigilant to protect the forum organisation becoming a foreign policy tool of these two countries
6663729 they now seem to have usurped the moral leadership of the region
6663730 against this background and the situation which fiji is in now fijis people need to realise that in going forward as a nation we may have to paddle our canoes on our own
6663731 we dont expect the situation to deteriorate but we would be remiss in our duty not have a plan in place in the event the situation did deteriorate
6663732 if however the airport at nadi was closed then we would have to consider whether a military evacuation by air or by sea was necessary
6663733 we would work with what ever government was in place in fiji to try to get their concurrence if that was not possible then in the last instance the lives and the well being of our citizens would be paramount and we would do it with or without that concurrence

6663738 people need to know the truth about mccain he sealed his own records as well the records of all pows so he could continue lying about his pow experience he was never tortured never in a dog cell like the other prisoners and never deprived of food
6663739 without a doubt i didnt see mccain for at least a year
6663740 why have the north vietnamese honored him what did mccain tell them and how was he really treated
6663741 they gave him special treatment and it is documented he was even out of the country for two years instead of being in solitary confinement
6663742 according to my very credible vietnamese contacts he had an affair with the sister of nguyen tan thanh a high placed north vietnamese official since they knew mccain was the son of a navy admiral he was given a special nurse tans sister ive been told he fathered two sons with her one attending the university of colorado up until now though we havent been able to get their names

6663747 the acccs market inquiries indicated that the proposed acquisition may raise competition concerns in relation to the global seaborne supply of iron ore lump and iron ore fines
6663748 to the extent the proposed acquisition lessens competition in the global seaborne supply of iron ore it would be likely to have the effect of increasing global iron ore prices which would in turn increase prices paid by steel makers in australia
6663749 interested parties also expressed concern that there would appear to be few alternative suppliers capable of supplying significant quantities of iron ore lump and iron ore fines at a cost that would be likely to impose an effective competitive constraint on the merged firm across the anticipated business cycle

6663757 coaching in the final yesterday it was so good for my heart that so many people are engaged in womens soccer
6663758 if you looked at the quality of the game and the excitement it had everything extra time that game was not only good for the usa but it was good for womens soccer overall
6663759 womens football is improving all the time and its getting tighter and tighter so now you have a handful of teams that can win the olympics and the world cup and thats really good for womens soccer overall
6663760 things are going to happen we are going to get beat every once in a while by these guys there are just way too good but we knew that we couldnt get down on ourselves and i think that confidence throughout all our games got us to where we are now
6663761 later on in the game especially when it went into overtime we could tell by their body language that they were really tired so that we knew that we had to take advantage of that
6663762 it says a lot about the team that we were able to come back after the opening norway loss here and after a huge devastating loss at the world cup last year and losing some players as well
6663763 its just so much fun playing for her weve found a new passion and really love for one another

6663903 neither obama nor mccain owns the economy as an issue because theyve never focused on it really in ways that working class families would identify with

6663917 there was a time that i was so far away from even dreaming of this
6663918 that this has happened that it was possible for me it involved so many people other than just me the people who have supported me and stood by me and encouraged me to move on and be the best that i can be
6663919 to really show such great support in a time when it was so easy not to support me i do think of them thats where the tears come from

6663923 the rules are made for everyone else is his attitude
6663924 what they wanted to do with me was take my livelihood away and everything else
6663925 and i dont think thats constructive for somebody whos struggling to take their passion away i feel very strongly about that and thats what i feel was the biggest lesson to be learned is that everybody does deserve a second chance or a third chance if you believe they can actually come back and do some good in my case i had a lot of people believing in me
6663926 my story can show young people it doesnt matter what happens you can go bankrupt you can have a drug problem you can have an alcohol problem you can make a terrible mistake whatever

6664064 you shouldnt regard this as some kind of formal investigation
6664065 yes we have asked the gymnastics federation to look into what has been a number of questions and discrepancies on this case
6664066 they have been working with the national federation to really have a full clarification on this topic we believe we have addressed the issue
6664067 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc
6664068 an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6664069 there have been questions that have been on the table and discrepancies that have been eluded to by certain parties
6664070 the ioc is wanting to do its due diligence and work with certain parties to 100 percent clarify this situation and put it to rest thats whats in the process of being done
6664071 if every agent was prosecuted for what john talia has done there would be hundreds of real estate agents in prison with him today
6664072 this is one of the most common crimes in real estate
6664073 it will have dodgy real estate agents all over australia quivering in their shoes tonight
6664074 you cheated two vulnerable people of the large part of the real value of an elderly mans home
6664075 its a terrific outcome today because this sort of behaviour is completely unacceptable and thats why we terminated his agreement
6664076 anyone who takes unfair advantage of a client irrespective of what business they are in should expect to face the consequences
6664077 other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6664078 we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later
6664079 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment
6664080 all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6664081 the troughton era presented many a feminist role in the supporting cast yet the companions of the time were some of the most notable screamers in the series history
6664082 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6664083 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6664084 the russian georgia conflict has disrupted supplies and it looks like it will drag on and create a lot of uncertainty
6664085 we cant come to terms with what weve gone through
6664086 it feels unreal within a day my wife and i show up at the hospital our daughter is born and declared dead later we find out she is still alive and a few hours later we are told again that she is dead
6664087 i showed up at the intensive care unit and saw that she was dead my wife will suffer from this and well have to deal with it im sure shell need psychological help
6664088 cloud computing is one of those catch all buzz words that tries to encompass a variety of aspects ranging from deployment load balancing provisioning business model and architecture like web2
6664089 i view cloud computing as a broad array of web based services aimed at allowing users to obtain a wide range of functional capabilities on a pay as you go basis that previously required tremendous hardware software investments and professional skills to acquire cloud computing is the realization of the earlier ideals of utility computing without the technical complexities or complicated deployment worries
6664090 i think clouds are the next hype term for the next year or two people are coming to grips with virtualization and how it reshapes it creates service and software based models and in many ways changes a lot of the physical layer we are used to clouds will be the next transformation over the next several years building off of the software models that virtualization enabled
6664091 i do not regard our national debt as unduly alarming
6664092 weve overcome things far worse than what is going on right now
6664093 what concerns me more than anything is our savings rate
6664094 the problem is getting the public understanding and the political will to do something about it
6664095 the important thing to remember is that the pie gets larger over time and theres more to divide up
6664096 this regulation is not about contraception its about abortion and conscience
6664097 this lack of knowledge of provider conscience law within the health professions can be detrimental to conscience and other rights particularly for individuals and entities with moral objections to abortion and other medical procedures
6664098 the proposed regulations and secretary leavitts public comments about them leave the door open as to whether institutions and individuals can deny access to contraception
6664099 while the rules are not identical to the draft proposal being circulated by hhs last month the agency interprets existing conscientious objection laws so broadly that it could result in women not receiving information they need to make informed healthcare decisions
6664100 it undermines the doctor patient relationship because women will now have to question whether their health care providers are giving them complete and unbiased information and the best care possible
6664101 t he issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
6664102 is the fear here that so many doctors will refuse that it will somehow make it difficult for a woman to get an abortion that hasnt happened but what if it did wouldnt that be an important and legitimate social statement

6664121 quando um pa s importa produtos de outros pa ses importante ter consci ncia do impacto gerado sobre os recursos de gua nas regi es em que estes produtos foram produzidos
6664122 por exemplo uma camisa produzida com algod o cultivado no paquist o ou no uzbequist o requer 2 7 mil litros de gua numa regi o que j apresenta sinais de escassez

6664124 o que nos preocupa particularmente que enormes quantidades destes produtos s o cultivadas em regi es mais secas do mundo onde os recursos da gua ou j est o amea ados ou muito provavelmente estar o sob amea a no futuro pr ximo

6664131 there is a biological reason why the mother whale abandoned it but weve tried the best we could since day one to do the best we could for the whale
6664132 normally the births take place up in the sheltered warm waters in the great barrier reef and the calves have time to develop and gain some confidence and experience before they start their journey south
6664133 for any calf thats born during the migration and we know that occurs the risks are very much higher
6664134 we are thrilled that the public finds value and is learning about rfid from the content we post on rfid law blog
6664135 considering rfid is a relatively new and rapidly evolving industry it is important to stay abreast of the changes that can impact the bottom lines of businesses and the public as a whole and the government is learning too about the technology and how it can be put to best use to advance the public interest we are happy to provide this educational service to both government and industry
6664136 here are a couple of picture of simon yellow dog and charlie brown dog
6664137 when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go

6664140 having all kinda extra shit and also getting paid to do so
6664141 yes he did break the law he committed a wrong but he shouldnt be punished harshly because he had a lot of good reasons to do what he did
6664142 he believes very sincerely he couldnt participate in this war in good conscience
6664143 i still dont think that bush has proven we have any reason to be over there and i would be wrong to be a tool of destruction

6664146 the focus of our convention to people back here in michigan should be on barack obama not a distraction involving the troubles of one individual

6664148 the way he took on the defenders to create opportunity was really impressive
6664149 i was really pleased that we came out strong in our first home game

6664158 you shouldnt regard this as some kind of formal investigation but yes we have asked the gymastics federation to look into what have been number of questions and apparent discrepencies on this subject
6664159 they are working with the national federation who have been extremely helpful so we can have a full clarification on this topic
6664160 confirmation from the international olympic committee that all passports are valid for all gymnasts competing in the beijing olympic games
6664161 had many political disagreements with its contents over the years
6664162 modern society has come to depend materially on the pervasive stability of large scale infrastructures
6664163 technical arrangements that determine social results in a way that logically and temporally precedes their actual use there are predictable social consequences to deploying a given technology or set of technologies
6664164 fiscal and monetary policies will be complemented by interventions that will lead to increased agricultural productivity this should have a downward effect on the general price level
6664165 inflation averaged above the target of 5 due to structural bottlenecks whilst the factors responsible for the instability continue to raise commodity prices what strategies have been put now in place to maintain it at the projected 5
6664166 if there is a discrepancy on your date of birth or youre being vague with us or you just wont answer us and you cant speak very good english youll probably go up to 287 g
6664167 if they find something says you are here legal whether its a workers pass or whatever it may be then youll be sent right back down
6664168 the 287 g program will not only benefit the county but it does in fact benefit the public itself by removing and taking away illegal immigrants that have criminal convictions
6664169 were going to call that supervisor of that officer it that happens and say you might want to see what officer john doe is doing because the people hes bringing to our jail is 95 percent one race or the other i will do that
6664170 the social stigma of the child being born outside marriage
6664171 officials will work very closely with federal and state agencies to investigate these claims
6664172 why didnt you discover the cure for such and such
6664173 there is a general demand for liberalisation or dollarisation of the industry in terms of rent or prices paid in line with what has happened with the foreign currency sector
6664174 here i do not mean re dollarisation of our worthless currency but rather floating of the united states dollar as legal tender in all transactions
6664175 this is the only practical remedy that the country needs now in order to kill speculators once and for all
6664176 such a bold courageous move may be embarrassing to make because of perceived hatred of the united states government but ultimately it may serve our national interests
6664177 thus the overwhelming use of foreign currency in broad day light by many members of the public is a clear sign that the law penalising use of foreign currency as a medium of exchange has become superfluous absurd and totally unacceptable
6664178 this will curb black market activities and formalise all operations
6664179 it will also attract and generate additional foreign currency reserves in line with the homelink concept that the central bank introduced some time ago
6664180 we believe nov 14 is a great date that allows us to play straight through thanksgiving and right into christmas
6664181 many of you have written to me to express your disappointment in our moving harry potter and the half blood prince to summer 2009
6664182 please be assured that we share your love for harry potter and would certainly never do anything to hurt any of the films over the past ten years we have nurtured and protected each film and the integrity of the books upon which they are based to the best of our ability
6664183 the decision to move harry potter and the half blood prince was not taken lightly and was never intended to upset our harry potter fans we know you have built this series into what it is and we thank you for your ongoing enthusiasm and support
6664184 many of you have written to me to express your disappointment in our moving harry potter and the half blood prince to summer 2009

6664187 i am sorry to have disappointed you now but if you hold on a little longer i believe it will be worth the wait

6664190 inflation has clearly increased even though the official consumer prices index cpi imparts a substantial upward bias
6664191 the mission looks forward to the expeditiously implementing of steps that would bring the cpi compilation in line with international best practice
6664192 when you look at data from other african countries that almost share the kenyas economic and policies environment you cannot pick out why our rates are so high
6664193 we have faith in the work being done by the bureau
6664194 i know there are challenges in terms of capacity and funding but those challenges are being addressed
6664195 at the moment with inflation at double digits the return on investment is pretty negative
6664196 nevertheless inflation continues to be a source of concern to the committee this will require careful monitoring and where necessary taking of appropriate action
6664197 to the extent that cbk is concerned it has continued to try and keep interest rates within the range of small borrowers who would increase the output of the economy hence the need to reduce inflationary pressure
6664198 we are glad to partner with seven rings international to offer this employment enhancement programme under which aptech would share its expertise in corporate computing and soft skills development the partnership will help cater to the growing demand for skilled manpower starting with india we look forward to taking this training across the globe

6664205 the regulatory and participatory framework for interested firms has been put in place
6664206 we have a higher weight of fuel in our cpi at about 7 5 percent and botswana has been hardest hit because of the way fuel prices have been going up in the past year we have a big country and a lot of cars and people here drive around a lot
6664207 i have not looked at the statistics in other countries but my guess is that poorer countries such as zambia and swaziland will tend to have a much lesser weight of fuel in their cpi
6664208 the poor tend to have a large component of their incomes going towards food consumption
6664209 i reckon inflation should start going down before the end of the year because as you might be aware food prices have not been going up for the past two months on the international market whilst oil prices seem to have peaked
6664210 we believe that it is more crucial at this moment to support the domestic agricultural sector if the country is to cushion itself against rampant food prices on the international market
6664211 the central bank reaction to any further rise in inflation is still to be seen but it is our view that any further rise in interest rates will not have a significant impact on inflation as the current inflationary pressures are emanating from high oil prices and food prices on the international market over which we do not have any control
6664212 it has been a continuation of the move of the last few days with the rand weakening on the strong dollar

6664214 tomorrow today we will be charging 15 trillion to get to harare and the fare might go up again any time soon
6664215 the amount is just way beyond my reach i cannot afford to travel to harare
6664216 we are living in zimbabwe but are expected to pay in foreign currency just to get to harare a zimbabwean city
6664217 the touts are a menace because they are the ones that usually peg prices for the trips so that they get some money out of it i appeal to the authorities to deal with these conductors and touts because they are the ones who are fuelling price increases by charging us in foreign currency

6664220 unlike a month ago the safaricom ipo refunds are being channelled into the market easing the liquidity crunch that had hit the market
6664221 the liquidity situation is realigning itself and the market is returning to normalcy as more and more banks start accessing funds as citi releases the refund cheques
6664222 zdnets zero day blog is reporting that a dns server of
6664223 the issue is extremely serious and all name servers should be patched as soon as possible updates are also being released for a variety of other platforms since this is a problem with the dns protocol itself not a specific implementation the good news is this is a really strange situation where the fix does not immediately reveal the vulnerability and reverse engineering isnt directly possible
6664224 the effective transfer rate of more than 200mbps is as fast as wired usb 2 0
6664225 its not a surprise anymore when he goes out there and pitches like that
6664226 its against detroit next tuesday thats where my focus is
6664227 i usually do a good job of getting out of those problems
6664228 its not like those errors would have ended the inning im not making good pitches after that
6664229 i had to battle the double plays were big give credit to the offense when you get five runs in the first three innings it gives you some cushion
6664230 youre going to get yourself in tough situations and you have to limit the damage
6664231 cliff has done a good job of that this season
6664232 i would rather have people go out there and hit home runs than walk somebody i hate walks
6664233 i went out to the mound many times to check pitchers injuries but never for a cracked molar we needed a dentist
6664234 that was a little cubbie occurrence that was a first for me first for the umpire
6664235 we had zambrano sort of on the ropes early he wasnt that sharp and he got out of the first with no runs he had a runner on third with less than two outs that was really the difference in the ball game
6664236 we held their offense down pretty good too we played a good series we just came up a run short of winning the series
6664237 carlos is one of those guys who swings the bat like a five or six guy in the lineup not like a nine hole guy
6664238 so you make a mistake to him and he makes you pay
6664239 it got me pretty square then i had to go toward first base but i had to get the out as bad as it hurt i just went after it and was able to make the play
6664240 when we came inside i said im going to take my shirt off and give everybody high fives
6664241 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting out there and playing defense behind me the way they are
6664242 ive been able to get down in the zone low and get a lot of ground balls and strikeouts
6664243 the sinker had great action the changeup was really good tonight
6664244 it just has such action down below the hitting area out of the hand it looks like a good pitch to hit and you have to commit
6664245 we have to start stringing together some wins we cant just keep winning one here losing one there weve got to get on a streak here hopefully that can start friday night
6664246 we have to do better if we want to play in october
6664247 we made things happen we had that winning attitude right now it feels like we have to be a little perfect we have to do everything right to catch a break and get a win
6664248 hes not the best pitcher in the game for nothing
6664249 hes not going to leave the ball in the middle of the plate hes not going to throw too many straight pitches hes so good hed be the ace on any team in the big leagues
6664250 my sinker wasnt there my slider wasnt there my change up wasnt there i pitched like crap and i let these guys down today
6664251 sidney couldnt find his rhythm and we had to go to the bullpen early they just kept tacking on
6664252 we ask them at the end of every inning whats the score they say 0 0
6664253 i take it personally as a rematch because they beat us in 2006 and hopefully we can beat them
6664254 i was thinking im going to get a base hit all the way
6664255 the way that owners are going all about this points directly to a lockout
6664256 ive made it clear to the owners that were not accepting a deal that pays us less than were already making
6664257 i would like to watch the film talk to our players before any announcement or anything like that is made but i did like what i saw in all three of them
6664258 jason did a great job of running so fast across the field and just made a great play on the ball
6664259 everybody wants to know who the starting quarterback will be
6664260 i dont know i have no idea everybody looks good to me
6664261 it was a tremendous game to snap our losing streak and it went right down to the wire
6664262 we knew people were writing about it everywhere now we want to win a couple more
6664263 i just try to take care of things i can control
6664264 every guy in that room knows we can hit better
6664265 we continue to put ourselves in position day in and day out to win games
6664266 we have a good team we have good chemistry a lot of things are really working in our favor right now
6664267 it was a big win for us were really confident weve been able to find a way to win ballgames that is something we werent doing early in the year
6664268 double play wed get wright at second too he had taken off he was halfway home cant fault him i mean ball gets in the lights you cant see it
6664269 we just have to continue playing good baseball and let things happen the way they have been happening
6664270 i might have an opportunity to be out there one more time in september before this place goes but itll definitely hold a special place in my memories in my baseball career
6664271 lose a ball in the lights it costs you a ballgame a little flip to first base costs you a ballgame
6664272 we liked the way pavano was throwing the ball and we felt that hughes needed some more work
6664273 hes pitched in big games before hes pitched in the playoffs youre not talking about a kid coming up that is a rookie and doesnt have a ton of innings under his belt in the big leagues were expecting him to throw well and keep us in the game and give us an opportunity if he can go six innings it would be great
6664274 obviously hes very excited to be back in the big leagues and to pitch for the club
6664275 his plan and his focus was to make it back this year and obviously he worked extremely hard to put himself in this position
6664276 obviously his command wasnt there his breaking ball wasnt sharp
6664277 i let a couple of them go and it felt good
6664278 when one guy is out there playing the game despite whatever is going on and somebody else is not thats how teammates get bad tastes in their mouths
6664279 i think hell be welcomed with open arms im not asking him to make amends im just asking him to come and compete
6664280 i just saw it as somebody who kept getting hurt
6664281 i used to work as a till operator for a local shop owner who gave me coins to throw away because they had become useless i followed his instructions now that they the coins are back in circulation i have something to smile about
6664282 i found about nine trillion dollars z 9 000 in the new currency about us 60 on the first day of my secret treasure hunt and half of that the following day but the gold mine is drying up now
6664283 and that makes me the envy of many people who put on a jacket and tie six days a week and yet get peanuts from their employers
6664284 i have been struggling to put money on the table for years but in the past four days the sun has been shining brightly through my window thanks to the return of the coins
6664285 i can now give my children money to spend at school and i have even managed to pay up the top fees that the school was demanding
6664286 my employers throw these coins everywhere and when they are away at work i look in every hidden corner even madams underwear closets for them they dont know it but i have managed to gather about three times the salary they give me a month in a short space of time
6664287 sometimes we fight over the coins that we find in the streets but that the fights is a lot of fun in these hard times
6664288 we have to make as much hay as possible while the sun shines
6664289 the coins are bringing back temporary joy in two weeks or so they will be despised because they would have been rendered useless by the hyperinflationary environment we are operating under
6664290 no amount of tinkering with currency denominations will address the zimbabwean crisis
6664291 allowing people to scrounge for old money from their drawers will make it impossible to know how much currency is on the market
6664292 could further push up inflation which has now hit stratospheric levels
6664293 i think it was a shock to everybody quarterback jake delhomme said
6664294 it will be a tough deal for a few days said long snapper jason kyle who is the panthers union representative
6664295 hes been a close friend of mine for 20 years fox said
6664296 i think he was a real servant to the league he did great things and the league is a lot better now than before he took over hell be missed
6664297 what genes done what our union has done for salaries and benefits and things of that nature hes left his mark delhomme said
6664298 ninety per cent of the work is convincing people that the eyes are real the subtlety of the timing of eye movements is a big one people also have a natural asymmetry for instance in the muscles in the side of their face those types of imperfections arent that significant but they are what makes people look real
6664299 i am definitely very happy about this one mauresmo said
6664300 i thought i mixed up pretty well tonight and was really solid not giving her many free points and making her work for every point
6664301 i got a little tight on that moment mauresmo said
6664302 i guess i need to get used to being back again in these kinds of situations but after losing that game i really regrouped really well played a good service game and then put a lot of pressure on her service game i tried to learn from a couple of games ago and do much better next time
6664303 she was serving well i think and she has a great slice which i couldnt really handle szavay said
6664304 i was missing a lot and couldnt move really well she was good today
6664305 it was too hot in the beginning of the second set i felt a little dizzy but then i was fighting until the end thats why i won
6664306 its good because i won the match without playing my best level cornet said
6664307 this was a very important week for me she said
6664308 i dont think i could have asked for a better week before the u s open
6664309 i played really well today said wozniacki who will face cornet in the semifinals
6664310 in the second set i just fought one point at a time everything was going my way
6664311 she doesnt give you any points especially on hardcourts she just played better than me today
6664312 i want to dedicate my victory today to all the victims and all the families of the victims in the flight in madrid yesterday and send them all of my support and everything of me that i can help for them said verdasco who lives in madrid
6664313 it is my hometown and when this thing happened i felt so bad yesterday and today
6664314 government is not interested in paying the right cost for capital
6664315 the recent tumble of the stock market is a reflection of this problem
6664316 banks have become victims of abrupt policy changes and disposing of their stocks thus becomes the only option to improve liquidity
6664317 what we are seeing now is the release of pent up demand for cash which is also a direct indication of the hyperinflationary environment that we are living in
6664318 the high cost of borrowing in zambia is attributed more to the high interest rates relative to inflation as well as the strengthening kwacha that has appreciated 13 year to date
6664319 notwithstanding the high levels of cash stocks sitting at the reserve bank ready for dispatch into the market some banking institutions have been noted to be engaging in imprudent and unethical practices which are creating artificial queues for cash
6664320 if theres a team that can rebound from something like this its team penske castroneves said thursday
6664321 theyve done it before and were going to do it again its tough because you have some small bits seats for example i loved the seat that i had and im going to have to use the spare one little details
6664322 the car was prepared for here my guys are going to do what they can were going to go out there put that behind us and hopefully that will give us even more motivation to go out there and do well
6664323 it really comes down to the amount of work that has to be done he said
6664324 the difficult part is the amount of time and effort that goes into the customization of the race cars and the trailer and the pit equipment and that type of thing
6664325 from a financial perspective its never easy and never fun but you run a similar risk every weekend when you crash a race car
6664326 at the end of the day you can say theyre 400 000 you can say theyre 600 000 but who knows there are certain parts of the car that are going to be salvageable and certain parts that arent
6664327 what we brought here today are very small things very unique tools things you cant buy cindric said
6664328 im confident that with the quality of our people anytime we bring a backup car to the racetrack that backup car should be prepared as if its going to become a race car cindric said
6664329 otherwise we shouldnt really have it here at the level we participate at
6664330 roger goes right into the technical whys and wherefores of how does that happen what happened whats the extent of the damage
6664331 the first question he asked was if everybody is ok
6664332 i have a lot of fond memories from last year but i hope it doesnt happen again watson said
6664333 from my perspective having finished early and having been behind by two strokes you never expect to be in a playoff
6664334 trying to balance the schedule between the two tours got a little difficult because i kept putting self imposed pressure on myself funk said
6664335 i kept feeling like i had to play good every single week whether it was the champions tour or the regular tour you just cant do that
6664336 thats my hope to get my game back to get my mind back to practice the right things funk said of his ambitious schedule
6664337 i still feel like there is something out there for me with the way competition is youve got to always feel that way
6664338 for sure i will miss this place said lorena ochoa who shot a 12 under par 204 to win the 2007 tournament by five strokes
6664339 its such a special golf course i like the greens theyre similar to home i like the par 5s if you can get good drivers you can reach a few of them and make it exciting and have some eagle chances
6664340 i would say the last few months have been a little trying said sorenstam a two time safeway classic winner who plans to retire from the lpga tour after 15 years
6664341 its been busy lately seems like ive been everywhere im running on the last bit of gas i have in the tank
6664342 we support the decision the lpga and sponsors decision to go to the next place ochoa said
6664343 theyve always made changes with the growth of our tour said sorenstam who won at columbia edgewater in 2002 and 2003
6664344 theres holes out there where i used to hit 8 irons and now youre pulling head covers off its like youre playing a whole new golf course
6664345 despite implementation of economic reforms from the 1990s the local currency is still weak against the greenback
6664346 however over the last 18 months the bank of tanzania has done a good job in sticking to monetary policies that control money supply which has resulted to having a strong shilling
6664347 going forward for this month we see tanzania shilling strengthening from the nmb ipo which is likely to drain shillings from the market
6664348 the shilling remained under pressure to depreciate on tuesday driven by strong foreign currency demand that came through in the mid morning session the market opened in the range of sh1155 1160 but briefly traded at sh1158 1163 before it later settled at sh1156 1161 levels
6664349 for now we will just limp along at these levels
6664350 but towards the end of the year i think we will see the shilling finishing strong
6664351 i can think of no better place to host the best the commonwealth has to offer
6664352 we have formally contacted the australian commonwealth games association to express our interest they have indicated that in the next few months they will decide whether australia will bid for the 2018 commonwealth games or future commonwealth games so i was keen to put our hand up early
6664353 we will now set up a local committee to work on our bid and to champion the cause
6664354 it will be a big challenge to secure the games but the potential pay off is enormous
6664355 it is estimated the recent 2006 commonwealth games in melbourne generated hundreds of millions for the victorian economy
6664356 more than 12 5 000 visitors came to the games and more than 13 000 jobs were created
6664357 however while these projects are significant there is no doubt more work will need to be done if we are to be successful in our bid
6664358 any money spent will be an investment for the future of this region and for our sate
6664359 nearly 10 per cent of our current olympic athletes are from the gold coast which is a testament to our sporting status
6664360 we clearly have the perfect weather for an event like this you couldnt get a better location
6664361 this is reflective of the sporting and accomodation facilities that we have and will have by 2018
6664362 it would be fantastic for south east queensland and the whole region and would bring enormous opportunities across the board
6664363 i think the only issues we would have would be coping with the infrastructure and the sheer magnitude of the games
6664364 transport is only one component financially socially and from a skills perspective there would need to be an enormous investment
6664365 organisers would also need to do a lot of research into its feasibility
6664366 there are definitely lessons to be learned and a lot of heartache that could be avoided from melbournes experience with the commonwealth games
6664367 this month aoc chief john coates indicated queensland would be the next cab off the rank when it comes to australia bidding for the olympics
6664368 it will probably be 20 or 30 years down the track but if we are successful with the commonwealth games it will certainly put in place the foundations for a successful olympics
6664369 i think the only issues we would have would be coping with the infrastructure and the sheer magnitude of the games
6664370 transport is only one component financially socially and from a skills perspective there would need to be an enormous investment
6664371 organisers would also need to do a lot of research into its feasibility
6664372 there are definitely lessons to be learned and a lot of heartache that could be avoided from melbournes experience with the commonwealth games
6664373 this month aoc chief john coates indicated queensland would be the next cab off the rank when it comes to australia bidding for the olympics
6664374 it will probably be 20 or 30 years down the track but if we are successful with the commonwealth games it will certainly put in place the foundations for a successful olympics
6664375 le gouvernement quel type de soutien peut il donner je ne sais pas je consid re que le soutien populaire est plus important
6664376 the team lacks an understanding of some simple things that hopefully will get better once we drive some points home
6664377 weve got a team where i can play in a role that suits me
6664378 he certainly required us to use a lot of energy
6664379 we lost the ball in a bad spot on the field before the goal and did not react well as a group
6664380 i strongly believe that eddie lewis will be an outstanding addition to the galaxy bruce arena the new general manager and coach of the galaxy said in a statement
6664381 he brings great experience to the club and will be a wonderful addition to our locker room and is a player that the fans are sure to support
6664382 unfortunately the sport of soccer is also a business and in order to bring eddie to the galaxy we were required to make salary budget space available and our only available option was to move carlos

6664384 the landfill site is dangerously close to the taj mahal and the yamuna river and is in the sensitive taj trapezium environmental impact assessments are yet to be made and the details of the project still to be worked out
6664385 the production of methane gas release of dioxins and the huge volume of solid waste will cause damage to the environment around the taj mahal
6664386 established norms and procedures are being given the goby because government agencies are in a great hurry to rush through the project
6664387 so many projects in the past have either been shifted or closed down because of the adverse impact on agras environment in the same way every facet of this problem has to be thoroughly studied
6664388 this means all the liquid wastes would automatically flow into the river which is just 200 metres away through the dense green cover that supports rich fauna
6664389 seeping and leeching will be two major problems in the area which will impact the ecology of the river
6664390 all aspects of the pollution problem are being addressed and the project will go ahead only when all sections of the people are satisfied
6664391 according to the plan at the kuberpur site all garbage will be converted into green fuel
6664392 but is it safe from environmental angles so far the authorities concerned have not come out clean on this issue

6664404 does not meet the required 250 000 population to create another legislative district
6664405 it is a violation of the law if another district will be created with less than 250 000 population it will set a bad precedent because other legislative districts if not all will also seek to create additional district for the sole purpose of serving certain political accommodations
6664406 the justification advanced by congressman raul gonzalez jr that when a legislative district exceeds a population of 250 000 another district may be created to represent any excess thereof may create a scenario where legislative district having a population of 260 000 can have two legislative districts by having one of it maintain 250 000 population and another district to represent the remaining 10 000
6664407 if this can be done in iloilo city why cant the same be done in the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th districts of iloilo province or maybe why not also in negros bacolod cebu davao manila ilocos pampanga palawan maguindanao jolo sulu or in all the cities provinces of the country from aparri to jolo
6664408 if we start allowing it in iloilo city in violation of the law others will follow and we can expect an increase of membership in the house of representatives from about 240 to 480 thereby increasing the national budget requirement to fund the offices of the additional 240 congressmen
6664409 undoubtedly worsen our economic situation because the deficit will be increased by the needed funds for the offices of the additional 240 congressmen
6664410 if the bill is not approved before 2010 we will know who among the senators will not get our support
6664411 we are thankful that secretary teodoro and other officials took time to come here and give this medal it shows that we are not alone and that is an important thing for my children
6664412 i hoped to be trained well in this area when i entered tnt i became more exposed to researching and news gathering and writing this is a challenge for me
6664413 tnts quality reflects the way the company is managed and im glad to be a part of it youll fall in love with the paper
6664414 after i went back to antique i just wanted to stay here and make projects that could help my province
6664415 antique is rich in natural resources and we need to protect and care for such one way to ensure awareness is to tap the students
6664416 we got private companies to sponsor this we are going to make this a yearly event after the success of the first one
6664417 i saw kids here play the sport but had no skills during the regional meet last march we had no representatives so we had to get a trainor to hold a seminar for referees so they can train these kids this is effort is not for profit i hope people will realize that sports is important
6664418 when these kids grow up antique will benefit a lot
6664419 i hired new reporters like those who just graduated from college i wanted to teach the young so that when they go home they could influence others
6664420 i have no plans of running for public office yes i was approached by some but i turned them down anyway with me being in the media i could easily influence others true and dedicated media people have a role in influencing society
6664421 cloud computing is one of those catch all buzz words that tries to encompass a variety of aspects ranging from deployment load balancing provisioning business model and architecture like web2
6664422 i view cloud computing as a broad array of web based services aimed at allowing users to obtain a wide range of functional capabilities on a pay as you go basis that previously required tremendous hardware software investments and professional skills to acquire cloud computing is the realization of the earlier ideals of utility computing without the technical complexities or complicated deployment worries
6664423 i think clouds are the next hype term for the next year or two people are coming to grips with virtualization and how it reshapes it creates service and software based models and in many ways changes a lot of the physical layer we are used to clouds will be the next transformation over the next several years building off of the software models that virtualization enabled

6664432 we need to upgrade our revenue code because even our burial fee is only 5 pesos
6664433 the amendment of the tax code was studied for more than a year already
6664434 the motorcycle or scooter shall not carry cargo other than the saddle bags or luggage carriers specifically designed and approved by the department of trade and industry dti
6664435 any modification of the original standard design of a motorcycle or scooter shall first be subject to the approval of lto and the dti
6664436 it is ridiculous why will they prevent us from beautifying our motorcycles it is our own property so we have the right on what to do with it
6664437 if it is unlawful to modify motorcycles then why do they allow modification of public utility jeepneys and other motor vehicles it is unfair
6664438 we will prioritize projects with short gestation period seaweed projects and distribution of fingerlings for the aquaculture for the captured fisheries we want to replace the lost or damaged fishing gears as soon as we can
6664439 we have to take permission from the bsf and they allow us to enter and stay in india from six am to six pm

6664473 all we need is a source of yttrofluorite and we can fire up the drone factory and try a limited production run if the equipments sound we could be mass producing drones as soon as next year cool huh
6664474 yttrofluorite is easy to look for but hard to find the base element were after is pretty rare but ive got like ten geologists and a chemist working on it one of thems bound to come up with something

6664601 as it is we need to work with china because of the role that china has played so far i think the potential of the role one of friendship and the cooperation many of the problems confronting the region are not of our making whether you are talking of the resources whether you are talking about trade climate change and economy we certainly need the cooperation and support from china
6664602 china received the largest number of athletes from around the pacific region they have received wonderful care and have been given great opportunity to compete with others and learned a great deal we hope to make use of these experiences and are confident of the athletes in their competition
6664603 held in a secure format on site and downloaded onto a memory stick for processing which has since been lost
6664604 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6664605 we expect the home office to provide us at the information commissioners office with a copy of the internal investigation report and its findings
6664606 we will then decide what further action may be appropriate searching questions must be answered about what safeguards were in place to protect this information
6664607 its entrusted with a great deal of highly confidential material and it seems to be entirely incapable of keeping it secure
6664608 and the consequences are very serious theyre serious because it may lead to the identity of the people involved being revealed
6664609 one of the possible consequences is that they criminals will bring legal actions against the government and the taxpayer will then have to pay damages to people who appear to be pretty undeserving because of the governments incompetence
6664610 the government is not giving attention to this at all
6664611 its so involved in this quagmire on the judges its not paying attention to the real challenges the country is facing and terrorism is the most important challenge facing this nation
6664612 is it our war or is it somebody elses war why are we being made to kill our own people

6664628 but will god really dwell on earth the heavens even the highest heaven cannot contain you how much less this temple i have built
6664629 when a man wrongs his neighbor and is required to take an oath and he comes and swears the oath before your altar in this temple
6664630 when your people israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against you and when they turn back to you and confess your name praying and making supplication to you in this temple
6664631 when the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you and when they pray toward this place and confess your name and turn from their sin because you have afflicted them
6664632 when famine or plague comes to the land or blight or mildew locusts or grasshoppers or when an enemy besieges them in any of their cities whatever disaster or disease may come
6664633 as for the foreigner who does not belong to your people israel but has come from a distant land because of your name
6664634 when your people go to war against their enemies wherever you send them and when they pray to the
6664635 when they sin against you for there is no one who does not sin and you become angry with them and give them over to the enemy who takes them captive to his own land far away or near
6664636 may your eyes be open to your servants plea and to the plea of your people israel and may you listen to them whenever they cry out to you 53 for you singled them out from all the nations of the world to be your own inheritance just as you declared through your servant moses when you o sovereign 54 when solomon had finished all these prayers and supplications to the lord where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven 55 he stood and blessed the whole assembly of israel in a loud voice saying lord who has given rest to his people israel just as he promised not one word has failed of all the good promises he gave through his servant moses lord our god be with us as he was with our fathers may he never leave us nor forsake us 58 may he turn our hearts to him to walk in all his ways and to keep the commands decrees and regulations he gave our fathers 59 and may these words of mine which i have prayed before the lord our god day and night that he may uphold the cause of his servant and the cause of his people israel according to each days need 60 so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the is god and that there is no other 61 but your hearts must be fully committed to the our god to live by his decrees and obey his commands as at this time

6664638 a while after i got there three other people turned up to catch the 5 49am train to cambridge and one of them tried the phone and was told there was a side entrance to the station
6664639 unbelievably they then had to walk across the tracks to get to the train there were businessmen carrying briefcases walking across the tracks
6664640 i thought there was something odd going on when i arrived at 7am and the booking office was only just opening up
6664641 we are not happy about it because it is not the service we want and we will be taking this up with them
6664642 i can confirm that the station wasnt open i understand that the member of staff was late for work we hold our hands up and apologise the station wasnt open suffolk homes
6664643 the acccs market inquiries indicated that the proposed acquisition may raise competition concerns in relation to the global seaborne supply of iron ore lump and iron ore fines
6664644 to the extent the proposed acquisition lessens competition in the global seaborne supply of iron ore it would be likely to have the effect of increasing global iron ore prices which would in turn increase prices paid by steel makers in australia
6664645 interested parties also expressed concern that there would appear to be few alternative suppliers capable of supplying significant quantities of iron ore lump and iron ore fines at a cost that would be likely to impose an effective competitive constraint on the merged firm across the anticipated business cycle
6664646 in particular vale would be the only other supplier involved in annual benchmark price negotiations

6664654 i wanted to change a few things and that gave me the chance
6664655 its something ive thought about doing but i didnt feel like it was the right time to do it while i was trying to win games in the big leagues

6664673 i have had three treatments in germany at first it cost 10 000 euros but now it is available on their health service and costs about 5 500 euros
6664674 it alleviates my symptoms two years ago i was not able to get out of bed now i can move around and i am not as breathless and as blue the treatment allows me to lead my life
6664675 that would be cash for around six treatments i literally cant afford to reduce the price when i know what it could mean we have had no real interest at all we are stuck in a no mans land
6664676 we have arrangements in place to consider individual requests for treatments which fall outside of our normal commissioning policy

6664702 this statement is not only misleading but patently false gambari did not meet with
6664703 he gambari must do what he should do after meeting with burmese officials and the opposition he should give frank accounts to the public
6664704 for example if the junta is stubborn and doesnt want to negotiate he must frankly report that so the un can clearly understand the issues
6664705 we only knew that gambari came to burma and went back
6664706 we dont know whether he would like a chance to meet with us or not
6664707 we heard that he will meet with opposition leaders and ethnic leaders so we are hoping to meet him and we are ready to discuss issues with him as well we are now waiting for him but we havent heard whether he will meet us
6664708 the release of political prisoners will be the benchmark by which gambari and ban ki moon will be judged
6664709 its a normal first step when a country enters into political reform
6664710 if the regime is genuine about their claims they will reform they should release all political prisoners immediately

6664733 kami sudah melakukan klarifikasi dan dia tidak bersalah selain itu tidak ada bukti bukti selama ini pks sendiri masih membutuhkan seseorang seperti pak andi karena kinerjanya juga bagus juga pemikiran pemikirannya masih sangat kami butuhkan
6664734 seperti kata pak tifatul kalau ada kader atau calon yang terindikasi melanggar peraturan misalnya korupsi maka kami akan langsung memprosesnya tapi pak andi setelah kami klarifikasi dia tidak terbukti bersalah sampai saat ini saja kpk juga tidak ada pengadilan juga tidak ada jadi ya dia memang layak

6664747 believe that jesus died on the cross for our sins and that he is the son of god
6664748 the bible says i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
6664749 do your bad thoughts sometimes tell you that it would be easier and more fun to live in a way that is not pleasing to god to be bad instead of good
6664750 we all have those feelings sometimes your daddy and i have them just like you do
6664751 lets look at this another way you like going crabbing right when you put your bait in the crab pot and throw it into the water what happens
6664752 the crabs know that there is something good in it chicken necks yummy and they get in
6664753 when your bait is in that crab trap do you think the other animals such as sharks want to get in and eat it up
6664754 these animals can bump against the cage and stick their nasty little noses in the cage but they cannot get in to get what is inside this is the same with satan satan will always want to get in your protective cage god will allow him to come to the side and talk with you or reach in to touch you but satan can never pull you out remember once you are in gods hands and you believe in him you can never be completely pulled away satan stands no chance against the protection of god
6664755 oh i get it satan can get to me but he cannot get me
6664756 exactly you will have many encounters with satan he will try to get you to do many evil things all you need to do when these bad thoughts come into your head is say god satan is bugging me could you please take care of him and he will
6664757 they said traffic was being stopped and then they came up with we cant have a roadside stand and then they said it was a commercial enterprise

6664759 muy independientemente de los resultados que obtuvimos y que no nos alcanz para disputar la final esta gira fue ben fica porque primeramente tuvimos la oportunidad de entrenar y de que tuviera participaci n la gente que no ha jugado recientemente
6664760 el simple hecho de haber salido del pa s y enfrentarnos a equipos espa oles siempre deja buenas cosas y esta vez si lo fue pues por momentos cruz azul jug bastante bien y sobre todo que agrad a la gente de all creo que realmente lo que se hizo fue bueno porque ganamos un partido en penaltis que tambi n son v lidos ya que fueron cinco tiros muy bien ejecutados y eso da un gran m rito

6664905 the greatest struggle of the christian life is the struggle to keep on believing
6664906 do not merely look out for your own personal interests but also for the interests of others
6664907 no one should decide for you what is right or wrong you need to decide for yourself truth is what you say it is
6664908 and there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved

6664911 unless these sports are repackaged so that they are seen regularly it will be difficult to convince sponsors to put in money
6664912 with bindra you had a name and then a face in the case of sushil kumar and vijender kumar we barely know them
6664913 an olympic medal right now is a rarity maybe as we go on winning them it may lose commercial value
6664914 if not from the support of the government from private foundations such as the kind of work the tatas are doing for archery and football and the army and from the exposure to other sports available to youngsters today
6664915 we have not really explored the other sports i would love to say sports like wrestling and boxing have prospects but its hard enough finding sponsorship for motor sports football and tennis at the ground level
6664916 from an emotional standpoint it sounds good but marketers look at return on investments and the largest number of eyeballs is for cricket
6664917 the future sports heroes will come from the two extreme ends of society the middle class will go to education
6664918 there should be no bar on the kumaris from going to school as there are no historical and religious documents restricting kumaris from enjoying child rights
6664919 as soft and clear as a ducks the body of a banyan tree and the chest of a lion
6664920 naive economic thinking would suggest that if society offers better financial rewards to politicians it will attract the best talents much like one can buy better quality tomatoes or a better car if only one is prepared to pay more for them
6664921 politics they really care for a cause and or they enjoy power
6664922 politics they are there for the money and they leave politics when voted out or when outside opportunities in business consultancy etc are better

6664941 i certainly dont want to lose 100 games but i dont want to lose 90 either
6664942 losing 100 is not something wed be proud of for some reason that round number gets everybodys attention
6664943 if you lose 99 games or 98 or 100 or 101 or 102 youve had a bad year i dont want to lose 100 just so we dont have to answer that question were just going to have to play better to avoid it
6664944 this game is so statistically driven theres not one thing to be gained by not going out there to try to perform well
6664945 i think everybody when they step into that batters box or they toe that rubber theyre giving you 100 percent because its a reflection of their season
6664946 when we win or lose thats a reflection on the team but their individual performance if you think theyve quit on you it really is counterproductive to the persons career i dont think anybodys stupid enough to do that
6664947 the u s has won the last four softball golds so you wouldnt say that japan is the best now because its a tournament and theres always some luck as well but its good for our country to win a gold over the united states
6664948 obviously its a conscious decision to take more pitches and see the ball more but i dont think you can do that unless youre comfortable
6664949 if youre uncomfortable youre still going to be up there hacking at everything and i still find myself doing that in some at bats and being too aggressive
6664950 but as long as i try to stay back and see the ball go deep i have more success than when i dont
6664951 it would really be a boost to the ballclub looking to the future if we could count on him being in there
6664952 i dont know how much is in the shoulder how much pains in there how much better hes feeling i think eriks the only one that could answer it and unfortunately hes not talking to reporters
6664953 i am excited to offer this service to small business owners who are typically challenged when it comes to evaluating their personal property assets for lenders and other business requirements credit underwriting has tightened so having a credentialed certified personal property appraisal just makes good business sense for the business owner and for the lender it speaks to one of the best practices of the business
6664954 an appraisal mitigates risk if there is a disaster having an updated certified appraisal on file expedites the insurance claim process lack of proving the insureds loss to the insurer drags claims out and endangers the future health of the business as customers begin to use competitors products and services and form new relationships the cost of getting that business back can be enormous
6664955 colorado state university is heading in the right direction with record levels of enrollment private giving and research support this ranking just one of many measures of success is affirmative evidence of that

6664957 when you read media accounts at what online advertising is doing they are very downcast
6664958 the truth is if you look at the numbers they are not all true
6664959 the logic is that most of the growth in internet advertising comes from money that has been spent in other media before
6664960 when you have economic downturn like now the advertisers look at how they can save money
6664961 the first call is going to be to the marketing department
6664962 a lot of it is remnant its going to be inventory that is not very effective
6664963 you have different social communities and how they embrace that

6664965 im living with one foot placed in the future and the other
6664966 un choc entre le moyen ge et le 21e si cle
6664967 i dont know how i held on my whole body just went dead i pushed so hard in that last section and gave it everything i had it was just
6664968 i felt that i was a bit behind at halfway and i knew that i had to come through at the end
6664969 i thought qualifying for the olympics would be the hard part and this would be the fun but these races have been something else altogether
6664970 i felt a bit scared this morning and nervous but once i started my warm up that all went away and was replaced by this feeling of determination
6664971 it felt like all my supporters in the crowd were in the boat with me pushing me on its been like that all week with messages of support emails and smss in that last 100 metres everyones energy was pushing me on
6664972 i cant wait the girls are racing so well and i cant wait to see how it goes we are in the final and we have nothing to lose so i cant wait
6664973 i had a good rhythm i gave it absolutely everything ive got and i got to the end shattered i can be really happy that i raced my guts out but i just wasnt fast enough well done to the other guys
6664974 the whole of yesterday last night and this morning there wasnt a thought in my mind that i would be standing here saying that i came fourth but i am really not down i am proud of myself i was in with a serious shout in both races and i know i raced really well
6664975 proud for myself and so proud for my country i have had so much support from my coach nandor almasi who must take all the credit for starting c boat canoeing in south africa
6664976 vous les juifs devez tre au courant vous naurez jamais mais jamais la paix avec le hamas cest lislam comme id ologie qui les guide et qui ne leur permettra pas de parvenir un accord de paix avec les juifs
6664977 ils estiment que la tradition dit que le proph te mahomet sest battu contre les juifs et que par cons quent ils doivent continuer les combattre jusqu la mort
6664978 okay can you just get back to posting hot naked guys
6664979 how are you doing in your fight against a culture thats gone stark raving mad
6664980 instability in the hamas run gaza strip would be in fatahs interests
6664981 the situation has become so grave that partisans of fatah actually fled to israel for protection
6664982 more proof that cooperation with israel can only lead to degradation and loss
6664983 when news of the beach blast was initially broadcast on pa television in ramallah it was accompanied by triumphant music and patriotic anthems as if it were a victory
6664984 whose close association with israel was proven by the fact that they ultimately fled there for refuge
6664985 israels inability to remove hamas from gaza either by force of arms or by cutting it off from the rest of the world has prompted it to adopt indirect means of weakening hamas
6664986 now its using its agents inside gaza to incite violence domestically
6664987 might have been the beginning of an attempt to overthrow hamas rule
6664988 there are elements that would like to portray hamas as incapable of maintaining security
6664989 for the average palestinian meanwhile the humanitarian situation remains worse than ever

6664994 i had only ever been to one strip club before i went to new orleans to do that movie
6664995 yeah heck yes but then i thought well this is real research ive got to do this for the role man ive got to do this but yeah it was terrifying especially when i get there this guy was a doctor apparently he was an older man and they whip out the cocaine and they start doing cocaine on the desk and im like am i incriminating myself i mean i didnt do any of the cocaine okay i just went there to observe so that was scary it was in a nice hotel the guy who took us over had a key to the room so he just opened up and the doctor is just lying in the bed and he wasnt completely naked when we got in there but he certainly got naked

6665021 oh well if this is the worst thing that happens to me today im having a pretty good day
6665022 they told me they wouldnt have taken it if they had known it belonged to me
6665023 so i told them to just give it back and put an end to it
6665024 theyre not quite grasping the fact theyve committed a felony
6665025 i think the solvability expectation in this case is pretty high

6665027 we also recognize that we have more to do and we will do so both in the remaining weeks of this years congress and next year when we will have expanded democratic majorities in the house and the senate working with president barack obama
6665028 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
6665029 there has been a swirl of information based on being seen in a bodybuilding video that he is somehow concocting some fraud regarding his disability
6665030 i dont think theres anybody who thought we were going to bring out two live talking patients
6665031 from the lowest ive ever been to now its just great
6665032 i would liked to have seen more general public there
6665033 we will be able to deal with any implications arising out of the salary hike
6665034 we were hoping for something better than 100 000 at least so it was certainly in that acceptable range
6665035 weve got an appointment on tuesday to talk to city administration and bounce around a couple of ideas
6665036 one would be fairly unique and i think the neighbours would be happy
6665037 we talked to some of them when we were just walking around the property and they felt they had a park even though it was a school
6665038 weve got about three years of work yet ahead of us in moose jaw
6665039 we are honored to serve as the opening venue for this historic exhibition on behalf of the museum for african art grass roots speaks to the unique heritage of the lowcountry region and expands our knowledge of an art form that is rooted in our own community
6665040 it is thrilling to be able to tell this story through the coiled basketry traditions that forever link the two continents
6665041 this exhibition is about baskets in both places but because of new scholarship brought to bear on the subject it is really about much more it explores many rich cultural patterns both lost and maintained it shows how people have built and rebuilt their heritage over centuries of oppression and opportunity it reveals how a simple but always beautifully crafted tool has come to be appreciated as an object of art
6665042 the evocative power of historic places to address themes and issues central to american history and culture
6665043 and now your highness we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base
6665044 the argument that is sometimes heard in court i e this memory report must be true because it describes such a horrible event is as our data show on shaky grounds
6665045 as a result the presentation of negative information either true or false might increase the possibility that other negative materials become activated in memory this in turn could affect the development of a false memory for a negative event
6665046 the rewards are in your head the reward is invisible its what you like to do
6665047 we had dreams that computers would improve education and improve communication and help us achieve a lot of tasks a lot of us in our group understood it
6665048 what we were doing was not figuring out how build a computer it was how you get a computer that fits into the home price looks a lot of that stuff it gave us more passion we used the word revolution all over the place
6665049 i was doing really advanced computer designs when i was 10
6665050 i just loved computers and what they were and ones and zeros and the logic and how they added
6665051 sometimes when youre short of resources it forces you to do better work
6665052 i couldnt afford an online timeshare computer system i had to write down ones and zeros and simulate the computers operations it was all done by hand never once on a computer
6665053 some of the tricks were so weird i knew youd never find them in a book
6665054 i got a job a hewlett packard designing handheld calculators i was very lucky because i could design they interviewed and hired me but i didnt have a degree
6665055 i did go back to college i got my degree under a fake name rocky raccoon clark
6665056 i wanted my kids to see they had a dad who had a college degree i went back 10 years after i finished my third year
6665057 i would not sell something for money without my employer getting a cut of it
6665058 i was never going to leave hp for life thats where i wanted to be forever
6665059 steve jobs got all my friends and relatives to call me

6665061 the speed of the computer isnt enough you need a good approach and good thinking
6665062 sometimes i go into an apple store and say im an employee i get a discount
6665063 these press guys who write stuff like that they get seated first in the prime seats
6665064 now were in the age of blogs opinions get replicated facts dont come into play much
6665065 i dont like any articles that put people down like steve jobs because it sells everybody likes to see heroes beat up

6665069 were received some information which puts the matter to rest
6665070 if the gymnasts hadnt been cleared they wouldnt have participated in the games
6665071 u s a gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the international gymnastics federation and ioc
6665072 an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6665073 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6665074 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6665075 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6665076 so far everything that has been received demonstrates we have no problem for the eligibility of the competitors
6665077 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6665078 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6665079 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6665080 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now

6665087 melbourne host city in 2006 attracted something like 60 000 international visitors for the commonwealth games we can do it
6665088 i can think of no better place to host the best the commonwealth has to offer
6665089 we have formally contacted the australian commonwealth games association to express our interest
6665090 they have indicated that in the next few months they will decide whether australia will bid for the 2018 commonwealth games or future commonwealth games so i was keen to put our hand up early
6665091 in the next month or so there will be a meeting of the board of management to make a decision on whether we want to put a bid forward for 2018 then we will start the process among the state governments

6665104 coaching in the final yesterday it was so good for my heart that so many people are engaged in womens soccer
6665105 if you looked at the quality of the game and the excitement it had everything
6665106 womens football is improving all the time and its getting tighter and tighter so now you have a handful of teams that can win the olympics and the world cup and thats really good for womens soccer overall
6665107 things are going to happen we are going to get beat every once in a while by these guys there are just way too good but we knew that we couldnt get down on ourselves and i think that confidence throughout all our games got us to where we are now
6665108 later on in the game especially when it went into overtime we could tell by their body language that they were really tired so that we knew that we had to take advantage of that
6665109 it says a lot about the team that we were able to come back after the opening loss here and after a huge devastating loss at the world cup last year and losing some players as well
6665110 its just so much fun playing for her weve found a new passion and really love for one another
6665111 its the best job ive ever had its just the best thing that ive ever done and as a coach this is unbelievable sort of a
6665112 2008 will be remembered as a fantastic year with our best medal haul since 1908
6665113 we came here thinking we had 11 teams that could compete for medals
6665114 its getting tougher every year the other countries are hot on our heels
6665115 we came wanting to kick the door in and do really well
6665116 are at the top of sailing and will remain at the top
6665117 no hab an tenido la oportunidad de hacer algo as
6665118 hacer dos goles en semifinales da mucha moral pero lo importante es el equipo
6665119 once the games are complete we will be conducting a comprehensive review of all our programmes
6665120 i like all fans of team usa am extremely disappointed with the performance of our relays
6665121 this assessment will be the way in which we select train and coach our relays
6665122 2008 will be remembered as a fantastic year with our best medal haul since 1908
6665123 we came here thinking we had 11 teams that could compete for medals
6665124 its getting tougher every year the other countries are hot on our heels
6665125 we came wanting to kick the door in and do really well
6665126 are at the top of sailing and will remain at the top
6665127 what happened in 06 is in the past im not thinking too much about the no hitter i just want to stay out there more innings seven eight nine innings
6665128 i made one mistake i guess thats what it comes down to
6665129 it put a little length between us and l a
6665130 weve got to get ourselves back on the winning track right now and do whatever it takes to win ballgames we cant worry about how it puts us in the standings weve got to win
6665131 i guess you like they say have to learn the hard way and i learned the hard way today
6665132 it hasnt gone her way this time but she will be better off for the experience and certainly in london i think shes going to be a formidable opponent for anybody to beat
6665133 the sport of bmx is a fantastic entry point into the sport of cycling
6665134 if you ask the youngsters what they would like to do they will probably say bmx with all the jumps and bumps
6665135 im trying to push the whole sport of bmx forward and trying to get many more facilities into the country
6665136 its a great family environment for the youngsters to start off and you can start very young you can start at 6
6665137 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down
6665138 the investigators also reported that if the city water main had not been cut by the collapse of world trade center towers 1 and 2 wtc 1 and wtc 2 operating sprinklers in wtc 7 would likely have prevented its collapse
6665139 we recommend that building standards and codes be strengthened beyond their current intent to achieve life safety by preventing structural collapse even during severe fires like this one when sprinklers do not function do not exist or are overwhelmed by fire
6665140 it will slow us down and we will need some amount of time to recover
6665141 we lost a lot of stuff though some of it is reconstructible
6665142 anybody who is under our investigation would be making a mistake if they thought they were in the clear
6665143 the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery
6665144 when this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports it was the first domino in the chain
6665145 hopefully this thorough report puts to rest the various 9 11 conspiracy theories which dishonor the men and women who lost their lives on that terrible day
6665146 the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery
6665147 when this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports it was the first domino in the chain
6665148 the interior core of the buildings was a hollow steel shaft in which elevators and stairwells were grouped
6665149 no building like it a modern steel reinforced high rise had ever collapsed because of an uncontrolled fire because of those doubts engineers hold open the possibility that the collapse had other explanations like damage caused by falling debris or another source of heat a combination of an uncontrolled fire and the structural damage might have been able to bring the building down some engineers said but that would not explain steel members in the debris pile that appear to have been partly evaporated in extraordinarily high temperatures dr barnett said
6665150 australia and new zealand lead the world in harvesting solar energy and carbon dioxide to produce an abundance of clean green food
6665151 why then are both the new zealand and the australian governments proposing to force farm animals into their emissions trading quagmire and why are they subsidizing the conversion of farmland producing food into forests producing nothing but carbon credits or crops producing ethanol motor fuel what are future generations going to eat
6665152 so few votes and such incompetent leadership that they will pay the carbon tax

6665154 we try not to take people to jail and pay the 50 if we dont have to

6665156 our dog was murdered by the cops he died a violent death
6665157 he didnt deserve to die this way no family deserves that were devastated
6665158 the dog was coming at the police officers he was within a foot when the firearm was discharged
6665159 we joked with our mom that the dog was more popular than us she called him her grandson
6665160 he was the most lovable dog he was like our baby
6665161 he just ran up to them he was a social dog he could hear the gate opening and he wanted to see who was coming
6665162 mom was in the backyard and could also have been shot she was hysterical we were all crying my dad was in the police officers face they threatened to arrest us
6665163 he suffered so much we had to put him down
6665164 we dont feel we should be held responsible for paying them it wasnt our fault
6665165 if police are investigating an incident they are allowed to use reasonable force if they feel their safety is in jeopardy

6665185 support for the games and engagement with china is not at the expense of human rights

6665388 nos ha dejado el coraz n helado y un nudo en el est mago es una tragedia que nos duele a todos poco servir n de consuelo mis palabras pero queremos mandarles un abrazo a los afectados y que sepan que en pek n se llora por lo ocurrido
6665389 mi carrera iba muy bien hasta que me qued embarazada y me perd aquellos juegos el seleccionador igor turcin dijo claramente que no quer a verme nunca m s jam s me perdon que no abortase
6665390 turcin es el nico hombre del que he tenido miedo si le ordenaba algo a una jugadora ella lo hac a sin preguntar
6665391 yo bromeaba y le dec a al peque o sarunas me debes unos juegos ol mpicos en los que tuvieron lugar hace ocho a os en sidney nos compr entradas para m y para su padre
6665392 le he visto m s delgado y en plena forma ha mejorado respecto a otros campeonatos e incluso defiende con m s intensidad que es la faceta que m s le cuesta debemos buscar un ritmo de juego alto para limitar lo mucho que aporta en ataque
6665393 de luna de miel nos fuimos a china pero no con b rbara no nos fuimos xabi y yo en pareja a pek n a entrenarnos para los juegos ol mpicos
6665394 el cambio es brutal hemos de ser m s fuertes ganar m sculo
6665395 son regatistas ol mpicos y regatistas transoce nicos al mismo tiempo
6665396 psicol gicamente no es un cambio tan grande en el barco somos m s gente y se hace m s llevadero que unos juegos para los que te preparas durante cuatro a os sin tanta compa a pero el cambio f sico es brutal
6665397 para pek n hemos tenido que adelgazar por la falta de viento del campo de regatas y ahora nos pasaremos 10 meses alrededor del mundo hemos de ser m s fuertes m s pesados ganar m sculo
6665398 tenemos que incrementar su peso con un componente muscular no se trata de coger peso con s lo grasas seguir n un programa de musculaci n e hipertrofia
6665399 tambi n claro hay que aumentar algo las reservas de grasa porque se van a pasar un mont n de meses tomando comida liofilizada tres veces al d a adem s de tres aperitivos y no es un bueno un cambio tan radical en el cuerpo porque se pueden producir lesiones si seguimos un plan descerebrado los cambios bruscos no son buenos
6665400 hace dos meses el comit de barrio nos convoc para darnos clases sobre c mo deb amos comportarnos en caso de que alg n extranjero se dirigiera a nosotros ten amos que responder pero no preguntarle nada y si no pod amos comunicarnos con l deb amos llamar al comit de vecinos para que enviara a alguien que tradujera
6665401 hace unos d as vinieron tres periodistas extranjeros en una visita al barrio y nos convocaron en el comit de residentes para que contest ramos a sus cuestiones s lo respond amos no nos estaba permitido preguntar

6665408 our politics have become so embedded and so partisan with so many special interests that they require a massive effort from the public telling them we want something done
6665409 the prospects of being born in the united states are still better than being born anyplace else in the world
6665410 it has not paid to sell america short since 1776 and the time to start is not in 2008
6665411 hay ocasiones en los juegos durante las que los atletas compresiblemente querr an hacer una demostraci n p blica de respeto
6665412 a este portero en un champions trophy le hice tres goles
6665413 entonces vi que fallaba con el palo record que era su punto d bil lo que pasa es que por c mo sal an ellos hablamos de tirarle a la derecha despu s de siete penaltis c rner durante el partido pudimos ver que nos hab an bloqueado mucho esa zona a mis compa eros les dije chicos vuelve igual pero al final cuando me he puesto me he dicho no santi por la izquierda y he cambiado a la izquierda esto no es desobedecer o mejor es una desobediencia honesta
6665414 sus jugadores claves como dwayer y hammond no tocaban bola
6665415 sus delanteros ten an fallos t cnicos al verlo nos hemos crecido
6665416 de vez en cuando se hace lo que se decide seg n el v deo y de vez en cuando se toman decisiones aut nomas yo les he ense ado el camino ahora la fuerza la tienen ellos cuanto menos intervenga yo m s seguro estar de haber hecho mi trabajo
6665417 the car is not completely silent when it is running as it does generate some road noise
6665418 drivers of cars such as ours have a responsibility to take care when they are driving and be aware that they do not put pedestrians at risk i have been driving this car for two years and have never had an accident with it

6665420 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
6665421 its becoming time to give some credit to the in ring efforts of mark henry
6665422 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena

6665424 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time

6665427 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
6665428 i have never run 9 69 and i have never won a gold medal in the games
6665429 people have trained for a long time and he was making history
6665430 maybe that is his way of expressing himself i have done something no one has ever done
6665431 i think we should be happy just like the ioc is happy we hope that he will have a great future and hope that he can run faster
6665432 i think he should show more respect shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones not making gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres
6665433 were really familiar we really understand each other even our personalities
6665434 ive had little contact with her since she went to singapore so i dont feel conflicted playing against her
6665435 i dont think her shots are that difficult to handle
6665436 i controlled the match overall she also played well but from the fifth game on she seemed to lose her calm
6665437 a chrysanthemum by any other name would be easier to spell

6665439 todas las dificultades de los ltimos 10 meses hacen imposible que pueda tomar decisiones sobre mi pr ximo futuro pero si me preguntan si considero dar un paso atr s mi respuesta es s pero con matices no entiendo la palabra retirada como un adi s sino como un paso hacia otras funciones

6665472 the best argument against democracy is a 5 minute conversation with the american voter
6665473 cest quoi ce sentiment belge parlez moi belge o est la langue belge la langue par d finition trait dunion entre les peuples il ny en a pas en belgique la belgique a v cu parce que la francophonie ne veut pas apprendre notre langue et ne veut pas respecter notre langue

6665480 is this bigger than just my division and who should i let know

6665482 she just had she just had the bomb the bomb

6665497 just look at obamas downturn in the polls in the last few days and you can immediately see how disastrous the switch in obama strategy has been as he and his advisors capitulate to the inside the beltway logic imposed by the media and the hired gun p
6665498 when senator obama positioned himself as the prophet of a new kind of politics he energized millions of young people and even older republicans and people who had become so cynical about politics that they have not voted in recent years but that depended on him being the voice of peace against war social justice against capitulation to the rich and the large corporations and ecological sanity if he now moves to what the inside the beltway crowd call the center he ends up in an election campaign in which he will be trying to prove that he is a better general for wartime than mccain and a better mini manager of the same old system and that will undermine the hopefulness that was the ticket to his political success and the republicans will become republicans again the youth and the cynics will return to their other concerns and obamas political possibilities will be worse not better
6665499 we approach obama not as his political strategists but as religious ethical and spiritual leaders to challenge him to put forward a fundamentally new ethical vision which is actually the oldest vision the vision of our various religious and spiritual traditions and of the wise humanistic values that pervade all religions but can be accessed without being religious we hope that senator obama will allow himself to be obama again rather than be swallowed up by the ethical visionless ness of business as usual american politics
6665500 i love your mouth and i love your smile it totally melts me
6665501 this increase is a fortune and i think a lot of chileans are suffering today from high fuel prices
6665502 the contribution of migrant organisations to income generating activities in their countries of origin
6665503 the possibility to save at an mfi microfinance institutions is still not widely known among filipino migrants
6665504 another reason why until today no new savings have been sent collectively for microfinance activities in the philippines are reservations against rural banks among filipino migrant workers due to past abuses and closures
6665505 this is mainly because of little awareness on the part of the public including ofws on microfinance and rural bank products
6665506 some governments need first and foremost to build trust or even overcome hostility with parts of their diaspora
6665507 continuing attachment to the country of origin and possibly a disposition to eventually return home
6665508 governments in countries of origin can lead different policies to keep their diaspora attached to the country of origin
6665509 when promoting all types of migrant organizations projects governments also need to take care to not neglect poorer areas with less migration and therefore less remittances and help through migrant organizations
6665510 remains to be seen if this will convince filipino migrants
6665511 professionalism is a key to make saving deposits in mfis attractive to migrants while the safety of deposits is primordial
6665512 it is very important that migrants can trust the mfi for its remittances transfer offer to be successful
6665513 its not as if the gymnasts were doping or anything

6665519 its gonna get worse if they delay it they should think again ibigay na nila ang mga kriminal para matigil na ito hand over these criminals to stop the violence
6665520 is tantamount to a tacit approval of the criminal action of these lawless milf elements
6665521 it will reflect an insincerity to pursue the successful conclusion of the peace process
6665522 we should expect him milf chief al haj murad ebrahim to surrender and bring to government the two commanders who are clearly responsible for these acts nothing short of that is acceptable to government
6665523 we cannot make peace at the expense of the people who have been massacred the responsible people should answer to the law
6665524 sincerity will not be shown unless they surrender to government the two base commanders
6665525 let me make it clear that these police auxiliary groups will be limited to their barangays they will not be used as maneuver forces if they are from kolambugan one of the raided towns of commander bravos group they will be given tasks to purely defend and secure the villages
6665526 the recruits for the auxiliary groups will undergo screening and trainings
6665527 from negotiations our focus shall shift to dialogue with the communities or government conducting authentic conversations or dialogues with the people the focus of our talks shall shift from armed groups to the community the parameters governing our negotiations shall be a balance between constitutionality and public sentiment

6665541 coaching in the final yesterday it was so good for my heart that so many people are engaged in womens soccer
6665542 if you looked at the quality of the game and the excitement it had everything extra time that game was not only good for the usa but it was good for womens soccer overall
6665543 womens football is improving all the time and its getting tighter and tighter so now you have a handful of teams that can win the olympics and the world cup and thats really good for womens soccer overall
6665544 things are going to happen we are going to get beat every once in a while by these guys there are just way too good but we knew that we couldnt get down on ourselves and i think that confidence throughout all our games got us to where we are now
6665545 later on in the game especially when it went into overtime we could tell by their body language that they were really tired so that we knew that we had to take advantage of that
6665546 it says a lot about the team that we were able to come back after the opening norway loss here and after a huge devastating loss at the world cup last year and losing some players as well
6665547 pia not only strives for the players on the field but makes the chemistry off it and i think that definitely contributed to this gold medal
6665548 its just so much fun playing for her weve found a new passion and really love for one another
6665549 its the best job ive ever had its just the best thing that ive ever done and as a coach this is unbelievable sort of a pipe dream

6665593 but if youre like me and youve got one house or if you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6665594 by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6665595 he couldnt count high enough apparently to know how many houses he owns
6665596 we lost the ball in a bad spot on the field
6665597 we were a little bit thin tonight with the loss of some players not that thats an excuse because chicago was missing some pretty good players as well but the thing that im pleased about with the guys is that they hung in there and fought for 90 minutes
6665598 overall tonight the effort was good the organization of the team was certainly improved but not good enough were missing a few players at the attacking end of the field
6665599 were not certain yet when were going to be able to get him on the training field
6665600 they dropped me off at my aunts house in pittsburgh
6665601 i grew up a kid of the civil rights movements and i could have said i went to the march on washington but i didnt they dropped me off in pittsburgh pittsburgh
6665602 there will be a large screen on the side of the convention center and watch parties
6665603 the goal is to bring as many people into the process as possible
6665604 the five of us will be bunked together family style
6665605 when people say where were you on aug 28 we want to be able to say we were in the noise
6665606 the day martin luther king spoke in washington i was a young man in the navy watching the speech on television with my grandparents
6665607 i said if i ever get an opportunity to experience history like this in my life i will take it and now im 70 and i never imagined something like this happening in my lifetime
6665608 i hear people say hey can you hook a brother up
6665609 i tell them ill do what i can but please dont ask for floor passes
6665610 but they also want to know where they are located for accountability people with slas get penalties because they dont know where they the assets have gone
6665611 to go out there and say they were going from this point to this point would be complete speculation
6665612 the bears that had been on that last bit of ice that remained over shallow shelf waters are now swimming either toward land or toward the rest of the sea ice which is a considerable distance north
6665613 we have some observations of bears swimming into shore when the sea ice was not visible on the horizon
6665614 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
6665615 our impression is that this is one of the increasing risk factors that bears are facing as the sea ice habitat where they need to forage is disappearing and such risks were considered in the recent projections we made regarding future welfare of polar bears
6665616 polar bears can swim quite well but they are not aquatic animals their home is on the surface of the ice
6665617 to find so many animals at sea in a single survey on a single day is extremely significant
6665618 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
6665619 healthcare workers should not be forced to provide services that violate their own conscience
6665620 words in that draft led some to misconstrue the departments intent
6665621 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience
6665622 this regulation does not seek to resolve any ambiguity in that area it focuses on abortion and focuses on physicians conscience in relation to that
6665623 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research activity we think its badly needed our members are facing discrimination every day and as we get into human cloning and all sorts of possibilities its going to become even more important
6665624 first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building
6665625 obviously designers and engineers will be thinking of their buildings as they consider our report and theyll take appropriate action
6665626 they dont have the expertise on explosives so i dont know how they came to that conclusion
6665627 the fact that john mccain dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so called independent committee shows how desperate he is to change the subject from his shocking disconnect with the economic struggles of the american people
6665628 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
6665629 it is a big buy intended to go through the democratic convention
6665630 friendship with someone who doesnt like this country and is an unapologetic terrorist
6665631 he will gut you and show you your heart and smile at you he plays for keeps
6665632 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois
6665633 we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6665634 this technological collaboration enables users to reduce wasted energy while still being able to conveniently access all their files even when on the go
6665635 intel is pleased to be working with cyberlink on their new offering cyberlink live premium which supports intel remote wake technology the combination of our technologies enables consumers to reduce energy consumption by keeping the home pc in energy efficient sleep mode while still being able to wake it up to access media when away from home
6665636 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6665637 i want somebody whos independent somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have got a robust debate in the white house
6665638 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get

6665645 this investment in canadas research hospitals will result in new insights into the causes of illness new approaches to prevention and treatment improved health care delivery systems and ultimately in an improved quality of life for all canadians
6665646 our researchers are currently spread out over more than 65 separate labs located in 50 to 100 year old buildings that impose severe constraints on their activities
6665647 given the world class achievements of our scientists and clinicians in these poor conditions one can only dream of the discoveries that will emerge from a modern facility that is designed to encourage the interdisciplinary collaborations and synergies that are the basis for true scientific innovation
6665648 what it does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6665649 we are not opposed to the use of irradiation but its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source
6665650 with nearly half of all infants in north america being delivered by caesarean section or after episiotomy there is clearly a requirement for pain relief for mothers
6665651 however our study confirms that codeine as a treatment for pain may be unsuitable and cannot be considered safe for all breastfed infants
6665652 increases in the number of imaging scanners over the last few years mean that the majority currently installed and in use in canada are less than six years old
6665653 these newer machines are using the latest technology to produce more detailed scans

6665661 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28
6665662 im not leaving the dead kennedys so much as right now i cant perform with the dead kennedys for the foreseeable future
6665663 and its nothing to do with personal stuff or anything like that
6665664 sometimes i can look like homer simpson sometimes i can look like john mccain
6665665 its really neat if only i could make it happen at will
6665666 jim nantz is asleep in the cbs truck cause golf without tiger really does suck
6665667 weve asked him to do videos with us and stuff which hes also agreed to do he was very nice about it and then we blew it somehow
6665668 he heard we did way too much drugs and never slept
6665669 which isnt true so he didnt want to do it
6665670 being able to work with tegan has been tops on our list
6665671 hes a little bit of a latino guy you know
6665672 its a beautiful place we live a peaceful lifestyle here but theres also a real dark underbelly to it its reflected in the name in the music in the message and we felt like we really hit home this time
6665673 for one music has moved into a day and age when people are going to quit listening on cd players so therefore the cd is an obsolete product if you will
6665674 to put out a cd and manufacture all that product to put out there when people arent really buying that medium anymore
6665675 i have researched it and am not going to make excuses but the fact is that mediafire has made several upgrades recently when i was taking a break from blogging
6665676 in all seriousness i am the one who f ed up by not realizing that without creating an account mediafire has been archiving my uploads for my convenience via my browser cache and that as part of their new convenient features they offer automatic folder sharing which must be turned off i dont blame anyone for and am not accusing anyone of stealing things
6665677 please keep in mind that these records are made possible by our record labels
6665678 if you downloaded it in advance through the leak and you can afford it i urge you to support those labels and us by downloading it legally
6665679 in 28 years ive never had a desire to drive what kind of loser wants a car right now
6665680 and started writing songs that i cared about i just needed to find myself in some kind of way somehow it turned into a full fledged project
6665681 ben folds was the primary songwriter for that other band so i think thats the big difference this sound of hotel lights is something ive been doing since about 2000 just kind of refining it and working on it
6665682 basically it was something fun for me to do to step outside from my usual routine with hotel lights
6665683 trying to write for characters in a musical but then i would hear the song and i thought i can actually pull this off too so that how it kind of ended up on the album
6665684 some of our hardcore fans had been excited about that song for a while
6665685 i always liked the song and i always wanted to do something with it it seemed enough time had gone by and i always wanted to record a version on my own
6665686 i dont think i knew what i was getting into
6665687 i just wanted to sit around with my headphones and write songs on my 4 track its been a really fun transition and enough years have gone by now that i have a great band
6665688 well i couldnt resist throwing this out there but feel free to take it away
6665689 hey ive come up with something that nobody else has done
6665690 no no i cant go out mom says i have to work on my song
6665691 basically be turning the jury into my victims so i will be tried not by a jury of peers but by a jury of victims
6665692 the devil is here boy the devil himself the demon couldnt do what the devil sent him to do so the devil came himself
6665693 ich esse keinen zucker auch keine fr chte und trinke keinen fruchtsaft wegen des zuckers ich esse h hnchen lachs und reis und avocados
6665694 frjgioserkgeriohkeothkeothk yayayayayayayayy i know some may see this as an issue only for bbw models but really think about it how many of you have gotten comments that were not helpful in any way just hurtful rude and cruel 6 325 deviants said revamp user pages and add portfolios too
6665695 she wanted to know if the girls would have a place to primp once they got to the fair
6665696 we had to explain that no the stars cant really do that
6665697 we were thinking we were going to have another bad year so we put the protocol through and got it ready for our second season which really amounted to nothing
6665698 we know that mammograms save lives and if we can get even one woman to come in and get that mammogram earlier she has a much better chance of survival
6665699 i figured i was going to get treatment as good as can be expected and if it helps anybody else that is great
6665700 this cancer treatment is a shot in the dark they have made great strides and thats great but its still a crap shoot
6665701 the idea is that fish oil has anti inflammatory benefits but there is not a lot of research on whether it has a lot of side effects or whether it really works
6665702 i could tell smith was extremely intoxicated so i just tried to talk to tell him there was no problem
6665703 that was when he said do you want a problem and pulled out the gun
6665704 i am amazingly glad i had the means and training to handle a situation like that and everyone was able to walk away
6665705 we had thought buying a global bank worth 7 8 trillion won 6 7 7 6 billion will provide a springboard to globalising south korea s financial industry
6665706 problems with its book were more serious than we had thought
6665707 we judged it would be too risky for the government to inject additional capital into it if it incurred additional losses
6665708 we are studying a number of options and are open to all possibilities which could include buying lehman
6665709 financially kdb will not have a problem buying a majority stake in lehman as the u s banks market cap has fallen sharply over the months
6665710 the problems however are legal and regulatory issues i am not so sure if the u s government will easily allow a foreign bank to purchase a significant stake in one of its key
6665711 i doubt introducing paternity leave will solve the issue of gender discrimination effectively
6665712 the last thing women want is to be given the choice between career and family and then find that shes being discriminated against at the work front
6665713 but discrimination in reality can be very subtle too so what we want is to cultivate this whole spirit and this whole culture where it is really quite uncool to act against pregnant women really uncool for employers to discriminate against parents of young kids
6665714 i doubt introducing paternity leave will solve the issue of gender discrimination effectively
6665715 but more importantly we work through our tripartite partners snef singapore national employers federation and the unions to reach out to employers
6665716 we share with them best practices in the industry showcase good employers which have adopted fair employment practices and help employers introduce such practices
6665717 i think this is a more effective approach to address the issue of discrimination
6665718 that will allow them to discuss with their employees how best to minimise disruption to their day to day operations
6665719 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6665720 in the twenty first century nations dont invade other nations
6665721 scored its biggest success last year when 10 eastern european countries endorsed the u s invasion known as the vilnius 10 they showed that europe is united by a commitment to end saddams bloody regime scheunemann said at the time
6665722 that the scheunemann georgia lobbying link had been brought to reporters attention by a public relations firm working for russia
6665723 i cant believe amy winehouse self harms shes so irritating she must be able to find someone to do it for her
6665724 most of us have a skeleton in the cupboard david beckham takes his out in public
6665725 my girlfriend said did you know that hippopotamuses kill more people every year than guns yes i said but a gun is easier to conceal
6665726 when i was a kid i asked my mum what a couple was and she said oh two or three and she wonders why her marriage didnt work
6665727 so far bird flu has only killed 47 people by the time it ends its going to have killed 37 million its got to get going hasnt it if its going to be the pandemic weve all been hoping for
6665728 grandchildren can be f annoying how many times can you go and the cow goes moo and the pig goes oink its like talking to a supermodel
6665729 i like jesus but he loves me so its awkward
6665730 people were outraged because of barack obamas spiritual adviser i think its great he had one who was george bushs spiritual adviser jim beam johnnie walker jack daniels
6665731 to be bullied and pressured into doing things that are clearly not in our national interest
6665732 if we succumb to such pressures what next what will that do to our self worth as an independent nation
6665733 it is reasonable to expect that the best runnes should come from a wide range of countries and racial groups
6665734 genetically linked highly heritable characteristics such as skeletal structure muscle fiber types reflex capabilities metabolic efficiency and lung capacity are not evenly distributed among populations
6665735 it is fascinating to observe how individual proteins can determine addictive behavioral patterns
6665736 in addition our results open up whole new prospects for treating addiction thus blocking the nr1 receptor might protect from relapsing into addiction selective activation of glur1 would even contribute to extinguishing the addiction
6665737 it is time for women to be recognized on our national mall
6665738 so when do we get to watch some tv where there is no jumping running twirling leaping falling or splashing involved
6665739 who was the pig that did this to you i want to know
6665740 good morning your daughter has informed me of the problem i cant marry her because of my personal family situation but ill take charge i will pay all costs and provide for your daughter for the rest of her life additionally if a girl is born i will bequeath her 2 retail stores a townhouse a beachfront villa and a 2million bank account if a boy is born my legacy will be a couple of factories and a 4 000 000 bank account if twins they will receive a factory and 2 000 000 each however if there is a miscarriage what do you suggest i do
6665741 but there will have to be lots of consumer education before they will accept it
6665742 maybe the science community has not spoken enough about this
6665743 but they will be doing it more and more now
6665744 i hope we will see a reduction in the number of food borne illnesses
6665745 it gives the industry another tool to increase food safety
6665746 there is no reason to suspect a toxicological hazard due to consumption of an irradiated food
6665747 with all the scares that there have been involving spinach this is a good step forward
6665748 why arent they looking at the source of what causes these problems
6665749 the growers and shippers of spinach and iceberg lettuce will conduct assessments to see how effectively this can be accomplished with produce and what investment will be needed
6665750 i think there is a long way to go before irradiation is implemented
6665751 he just said they submitted and yet he just said theyre working on cool stuff

6665768 theres been a lot of media coverage just lately in relation to maintenance and all that sort of stuff so the plane was faulty so in hindsight thats probably a good thing

6665770 but the bigger issue i suppose is qantas as an organisation senior management and how theyre running their airline its all filtering down to us the traveller

6665772 this is a major breakthrough for older patients who have a worn out failing aortic valve and too many other medical problems to make conventional surgery a good option
6665773 with this new technology we can offer more patients a better prognosis sparing them surgery and a months long recovery period which all huge benefits especially if youre in your 80s or 90s
6665774 im actually hoping to join a gym after all this is over
6665775 im not trying to be arrogant or cocky but confidence is one of the big reasons you have success when you start to doubt yourself is when bad things happen
6665776 a lot of us are interested in applying more of these things at work
6665777 this is a great event but its just the start
6665778 theres been a tremendous groundswell in light of the public awareness of the issue
6665779 i think what a lot of county governments have been doing is seeing what resources they consume and what they can do to cut back
6665780 it gets back to the point that the greatest indication of current health is past health
6665781 it was one of our concerns coming into the season quite frankly and more than anything we have to evaluate the guys we have i cant be unhappy with the medical staff at some point you cant keep blaming them you have to get to the source of the problem

6665812 i felt an urgency to go through and gather my stories
6665813 you cannot escape that confrontation you have to kind of work it through so it becomes a great learning experience
6665814 the thing that stood out the most was that universal idea of reaching out to people you dont necessarily get along with
6665815 a lot of people have said at the screenings i had a sister keller
6665816 we were really tracting and a lot of people wouldnt stop
6665817 i got frustrated because nobody would stop at one point i finally said please just talk to me that was one of the hardest and scariest things ive ever done i feel like i have a lot of respect for missionaries because what they do is really hard

6665826 cotton linen and synthetics heavily soiled with food stains or body oils may also be occasionally attacked
6665827 the situation is ridiculous there was never an issue that it was in the way
6665828 people used to go out there to have a smoke and pass the time of day i cant understand why anyone would complain were all shocked
6665829 the bench was very popular it was nice to sit out there
6665830 we used to have a back room which was for smokers but when the ban came in there was no where for them to go

6665854 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6665855 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6665877 the world is full of sorrow and pain thus we want to depict moods that bring out sparkles of happiness we have observed that there is a lot of happiness in the smallest of the things and we just want to transfer it to the observers through our paintings
6665878 45 of my paintings are going to be on display in this exhibition and they are all done using oil on canvas further the primary element in all my paintings is nature
6665879 yes i have been experimenting with oil colours and using dilute oil colours i have tried to give the water colour effect to some of my paintings
6665880 all my paintings are imaginary but then yes they are realistic i like my paintings to be simple and easy to comprehend i do not have any notions about abstract but then i believe that it is important to portray what exists rather than what can exist either in reality or in someones imagination
6665881 i do not think formal training is important for an artist but it does help one to navigate in the right direction and yes as far as geniuses are concerned they are born
6665882 as a painter one must learn the philosophical thought behind the painting before you think of colours and design

6665887 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
6665888 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
6665889 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
6665890 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
6665891 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
6665892 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
6665893 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
6665894 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
6665895 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
6665896 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
6665897 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
6665898 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
6665899 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
6665900 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
6665901 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
6665902 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
6665903 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
6665904 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
6665905 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
6665906 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
6665907 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
6665908 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
6665909 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
6665910 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
6665911 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
6665912 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
6665913 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
6665914 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
6665915 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
6665916 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
6665917 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
6665918 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
6665919 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
6665920 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
6665921 every position has got to be filled by a top player if you want to win things on a consistent basis
6665922 look at the other top sides in the premier league even the full back positions are filled with the best full backs in the world now
6665923 years ago you could probably get away with carrying the odd player here or there
6665924 it was good for me to hear that from someone who actually played back then rather than it coming from current players where itd probably just sound like an excuse
6665925 basically what hansen was saying was that its more difficult to win the league now than in his day the standards have been raised much higher over the past five to 10 years especially with the chelsea situation and whats happening there
6665926 that was really the only suspicious thing about the letter and our national headquarters advised out of an abundance of caution for our staff and volunteers that we have the authorities check it out

6665962 everywhere about me as i write i sensed the saints invisible presence because for me saint francis is the model of the dutiful man the man who by means of ceaseless supremely cruel struggle succeeds in fulfilling our highest obligation something higher even than morality or truth or beauty the obligation to transubstantiate the matter which god entrusted to us and turn it into spirit

6665968 if we cant have a competitive proposal there doesnt seem to be a lot of value in us going through this process if the best we can do is come up with a proposal that falls short of what the department of defense is looking for
6665969 in the past you have encouraged many a troubled soul to trust in god you have supported those who were weak your words have strengthened the fallen you steadied those who wavered but now when trouble strikes you faint and are broken does your reverence for god give you no confidence shouldnt you believe that god will care for those who are upright
6665970 if my sadness could be weighed and my troubles be put on the scales they would be heavier than all the sands of the sea that is why i spoke so rashly for the almighty has struck me down with his arrows he has sent his poisoned arrows deep within my spirit all gods terrors are arrayed against me dont i have a right to complain wild donkeys bray when they find no green grass and oxen low when they have no food people complain when there is no salt in their food
6665971 does 1 corinthians 14 34 35 mean that women should not speak in church services today
6665972 women have much to contribute and can participate in worship services in the corinthian culture women were not allowed to confront men in public apparently some of the women who had become christians thought that their christian freedom gave them the right to question men in public worship this was causing division in the church paul was asking the women not to flaunt their christian freedom during worship the purpose of pauls words was to promote unity not to teach about womens role in the church
6665973 the godly offer good counsel they know what is right from wrong they fill their hearts with gods law so they will never slip from his path

6665991 sincerity in knowledge is that a person intends to uplift ignorance from himself this is since a person with knowledge and a person that is very ignorant are not equal
6665992 is one who is obedient to allaah prostrating himself and standing in prayer during the hours of the night fearing the hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his lord like one who disbelieves say are those who know equal to those who dont know
6665993 allaah will raise those who believe amongst you and those who were given knowledge many levels
6665994 whoever seeks to attain knowledge in one shot it will leave from him in one shot rather knowledge is to be sought with the passage of days and nights
6665995 the matter is more tighter upon a scholar than when one clenches his fist tightly even though the ignorant person is not excused because of his ignorance i e he will be held to account also however the scholar will receive a greater punishment if he abandons what he has knowledge of and doesnt act upon it

6666012 we have not been able to locate the mother we have exhausted all calls and leads that have come to us there have been in excess of 30
6666013 they all petered out to nothing the autopsy results are inconclusive and unless information comes forward to suggest who the mother is it will go through to an inquest
6666014 i thought she may have needed medical attention and i would be surprised if she had done so and a doctor had not bothered to tell anybody
6666015 a lot of our work is driven by and relies on assistance from the community if people are prepared to ring up and give us information to go on we follow it up
6666016 the investigation is ongoing and we appeal to anyone who may know who she is to contact crimestoppers
6666017 otherwise it will go to inquest but we need to discuss those issues with the coroner the direction the job is going to take and how they want to handle it as the coroner makes the finding

6666019 we are disappointed over the way zardari has put himself forward as the presidential candidate we have been totally ignored

6666047 the army and police arrested a suspected bomber not far away from scene of the attack
6666048 they also recovered a suicide jacket from a nearby mosque and seized explosives
6666049 i looked back and saw the limbs of my colleagues flying through the air
6666050 we shut the factory for a day to mourn this tragedy in which 67 people died
6666051 the army has killed hundreds of innocent people and we attacked it to teach it a lesson

6666057 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6666058 i dont think playing for england is a very enjoyable experience at the moment
6666059 players do want to play for england because playing for your country is the pinnacle of your career
6666060 when i started playing for england in the 1990s i did enjoy it but later in my international career there were times when while i wouldnt say you played with fear you did know that if things started to go wrong then the fall out from that was going to be very intense
6666061 we get the biggest crowds of any country for our friendlies but the flip side is that the intensity of being in the spotlight is huge we seem to be locked in a cycle of massive build up to the game massive downturn during the game after something goes wrong and a massive inquest afterwards
6666062 that inquest must be traumatic for all those involved and nowadays weve got players being booed when they come off and booed when they come on
6666063 you can go back to john barnes he was crucified on a number of occasions playing for england
6666064 i loved playing at wembley but the wembley crowd can be a difficult lot to play in front of at times players have been singled out for a long time but does it all come back to our overblown expectations maybe we need to take a step back and think about those expectations weve made one final in 80 years
6666065 theres a lot of behind the scenes politics with england
6666066 there are changes at the top changes of direction all the time there are so many issues its complex but i think we have got to look closely at everything we do and fabio capello has got to be given time to put his ideas into place
6666067 it will be interesting to see what capello does when sven goran eriksson first got the job he did get rid of a lot of the players over 30 he had a clean new broom at the time and that in itself gave everything a fresh feel and perspective
6666068 you switch the radio or television on and everywhere theres a phone in
6666069 everyones lambasted because everyones emotions are running so high so what was quite a promising performance up to half time became completely disastrous by the middle of the second half
6666070 theres huge pressure every time you pull on an england shirt so the question is how do we create an environment where players can go and express themselves
6666071 you can never take that pressure off the england players but maybe we can be more realistic about what can be achieved which way to achieve it and how quickly it can be done
6666072 facial transplantation could be successful in the short term but the procedure was not without complications however promising results could mean that this procedure might be an option for long term restoration of severe facial disfigurement

6666074 the freeways are surprisingly safe bicyclists freeways eliminate the danger of car doors flying open substandard bike lanes pedestrians traffic lights potholes and erratic lane changes even if cars werent gridlocked i feel safer riding on the freeway with vehicles doing 75mph 15 feet away from me than on the streets with cars traveling 10mph one or two feet away from me

6666081 historically demand for gt has been very strong now as part of the cannondale sports group we will be using the cannondale distribution center in the netherlands to distribute our gt and sugoi brands in new and more effective ways to these countries
6666082 in italy and france the gt and sugoi brands will be managed separately from the cannondale brand however the development goals and what we aspire to achieve are the same
6666083 we will be product driven and focused on developing a selected specialty retailer network
6666084 with sales greatly increasing in the commuting category and other categories as well we are looking forward to introducing several new products at the show
6666085 as qbp has grown with the market interbike has been and will continue to be the best venue for us to launch new products
6666086 were really really happy with the way this years event ended up

6666092 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6666093 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6666094 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6666095 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6666096 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6666097 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6666098 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6666099 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6666100 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6666101 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6666102 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6666103 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6666104 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6666105 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6666106 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6666107 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6666108 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6666109 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6666110 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6666111 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6666112 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6666113 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6666114 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6666115 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6666116 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6666117 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6666118 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6666119 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6666120 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6666121 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6666122 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6666123 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6666124 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6666125 as a leading travel management company our focus is to help companies optimize their travel spending regardless of economic conditions we are pleased that in todays environment businesses from across industry sectors and geographies are turning to us to provide the technology expert insight and customer service they need to generate cost savings and maximize their business travel investment
6666126 many customers we work with have focused on how to travel smarter and implement strategies to drive savings so they can keep travelers on the road it is in this type of environment that our advisory services offering becomes an even more valuable resource for our customers to take advantage of
6666127 quantifiable savings can be achieved on air hotel and meetings spend through in depth analysis of our extensive travel data repository benchmarking and the specialist vendor negotiation we undertake on behalf of customers
6666128 the latest online innovation from american express businesstravelconnexion com will grant corporations and individual travel professionals access to the wealth of information and expertise of our organisation and members of the broader business travel industry while asking them to supplement the sites value by contributing their own experiences
6666129 with the advent of new technology were witnessing the business travel industry moving toward online resources and automated services and our objective with this new interactive network is to continue to revolutionise the business travel experience
6666130 we have had an online booking tool in singapore since 2003 and there is strong demand from our customers in that market for an enhanced offering to date the industry infrastructure hasnt supported a fully online self service booking tool which is why we have created our own to give our customers access to the most relevant and accurate online content available we expect this enhancement to double our online usage rates by the end of 2009
6666131 in more mature markets such as australia the majority of domestic bookings are now made online later on in the year we will be launching an enhanced online booking tool in india
6666132 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6666133 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6666134 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6666135 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6666136 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6666137 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6666138 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6666139 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6666140 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6666141 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

6666159 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6666160 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6666161 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6666162 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6666163 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6666164 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6666165 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6666166 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6666167 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6666168 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6666169 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

6666174 jangan lupa kepada para pendengar bahwa mereka yang belum memiliki npwp pada 1 januari 2009 nanti maka akan dikenakan pajak lebih tinggi 20 daripada seharusnya
6666175 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6666176 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6666177 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6666178 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6666179 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6666180 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6666181 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6666182 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6666183 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6666184 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6666187 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6666188 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6666189 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6666190 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6666191 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6666192 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6666193 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6666194 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6666195 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6666196 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6666197 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6666198 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6666199 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6666200 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6666201 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6666202 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

6666207 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6666208 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6666209 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6666210 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6666211 this is expected to help in the effort being taken to tackle the problem of rising prices and improve the availability of these commodities

6666221 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6666222 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6666223 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6666224 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6666225 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6666226 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6666227 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6666228 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6666229 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6666230 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6666231 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6666232 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6666233 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6666234 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

6666237 cloud computing is one of those catch all buzz words that tries to encompass a variety of aspects ranging from deployment load balancing provisioning business model and architecture like web2
6666238 i view cloud computing as a broad array of web based services aimed at allowing users to obtain a wide range of functional capabilities on a pay as you go basis that previously required tremendous hardware software investments and professional skills to acquire cloud computing is the realization of the earlier ideals of utility computing without the technical complexities or complicated deployment worries
6666239 i think clouds are the next hype term for the next year or two people are coming to grips with virtualization and how it reshapes it creates service and software based models and in many ways changes a lot of the physical layer we are used to clouds will be the next transformation over the next several years building off of the software models that virtualization enabled
6666240 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6666241 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6666242 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6666243 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6666244 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6666245 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6666246 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6666247 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6666248 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6666249 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6666250 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6666251 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6666252 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6666253 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6666254 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6666255 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6666256 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6666257 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6666258 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of aug 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers
6666259 we talked about this date a week ago and russia sticks to its commitments in terms of deadlines
6666260 we need to have this country defended and we need new people trained we need new equipment and we will work very closely with u s to get all of this
6666261 have to help them rebuild because they are a partner in the war on terror
6666262 would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6666263 we have taken all this equipment to a certain place and are guarding it
6666264 i dont know what the fate of these hummers will be we dont have time to think of such little details
6666265 well think what to do with it its not our priority right now to give back vehicles to the u s
6666266 saakashvili bears responsibility for how the situation will develop in the future
6666267 i offer my enormous thanks to the russian federation and the russian people and the russian soldiers who we have to thank for our freedom
6666268 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6666269 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6666270 if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6666271 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6666272 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6666273 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6666274 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now

6666276 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6666277 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6666278 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6666279 it doesnt matter if they were or werent involved in an attack today yesterday or on sept 11 2001 we seek out terrorists and we will give them the option to be captured or killed or possibly flee

6666290 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6666291 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6666292 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6666293 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6666294 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6666295 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6666296 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6666297 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6666298 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6666299 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6666300 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6666301 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6666302 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6666303 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6666304 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6666305 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6666306 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6666307 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6666308 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6666309 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6666310 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6666311 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6666312 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6666313 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6666314 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6666315 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6666316 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6666317 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6666318 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6666319 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6666320 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6666321 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6666322 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6666323 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

6666345 i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president
6666346 i wont have my vice president engineering my foreign policy for me
6666347 there are so many people in this room that inspire us and keep us alive so i just want to thank everyone for keeping metallica alive
6666348 its unbelievable to be here and we are accepting this for the people that voted for us
6666349 we have been telling everyone we know to vote for the band and have been calling it a vote for change
6666350 we hope it will inspire other people to have the guts to do something a bit different
6666351 i like all fans of team usa am extremely disappointed with the performance of our relays
6666352 this assessment will be the way in which we select train and coach our relays
6666353 they jamaica brought their a game i dont know where we left ours
6666354 weve got a great history with them so its going to be a great battle
6666355 this is a team that has been playing better as the games have progressed and they are playing good its going to be a great test for us and i wouldnt want it any other way
6666356 weve got to play the perfect game and theyve got to miss more than usual
6666357 but its only one game thats all it takes 40 minutes we going to play the best way we can and try to do what looks impossible right now
6666358 both were pretty big the first one was the first one overall and thats always big
6666359 nobody had beaten them before and we did it first it was important for us because if we lost that game we had to play serbia in the quarterfinal and that would have been pretty tough but our victory put us against brazil and it made our way into the final much easier
6666360 the second one gave us a silver medal at least and it was the second time which was harder
6666361 they will attack us with their system and they believe they can beat us
6666362 theyve definitely found the way to play the fiba game and theyre playing way better
6666363 they have players that are superstars but they have a commitment they want to win and they prepare and they know what theyre doing
6666364 theyve been playing great ive been watching them they beat spain by 40 points actually 37 and thats not easy to do im telling you that right now
6666365 i cant wait i cant wait to get over that hump
6666366 these last two games theres no reason to hold anything back to be a champion you have to beat a champion they still have the gold medal no matter who won the world championship in 06 we have to go out there and take that from them
6666367 die geschichte wird zeigen wie korrekt die entscheidung des ioc war die spiele an china zu vergeben
6666368 we need to rebuild the military we need to make them stronger we need to have this country defend itself we need new people trained and we need new equipment and we will work very closely with the us to get all of this
6666369 153 people died they have all been found and taken to the morgue in the ifema crisis centre all of them have undergone autopsies regarding identification two types of processes are being carried out using fingerprints and dna

6666371 for more than a year one members have been trailing the presidential candidates asking them to go on the record with their plans to combat global poverty now were taking our message to the airways with this major new tv ad the ad features matt damon with different americans voices among them michelle obama cindy mccain and mayor bloomberg watch for it on tv and across the internet starting sunday august 24th but add your voice and share the online video with your friends now
6666372 the girls were 19 and 23 the baby was born in may its really very hard
6666373 we are working hard to avert a strike and to conclude the current pay discussions however we have full contingency arrangements in place to ensure that the usual high standard of security is maintained with minimal disruption for passengers
6666374 i am very much discouraged by this situation in kashmir it really reflects the ultimate inability of the indian government to reconcile the people of kashmir to their connection with india
6666375 as happened then the pakistanis are very likely to fish in troubled waters even though god knows theyve got enough problems on their hands
6666376 for sure musharraf was devoted to this peace process he got it started in 2004 but before that you remember he was very much in the bad books of the indian government and the indian public
6666377 and so there will be a temptation as there already has been to play for the audience and that can only continue to have a bad reaction in india
6666378 but you never thought did you that india would be longing for the good old days with general musharraf
6666379 i dont see that as a way of even in the middle term developing its popularity but it may feel so and i think if it does it will be a major mistake
6666380 wants to keep things on an even keel and eventually to pursue the peace dialogue but the disturbances in kashmir will put pressure on that whole situation and will tempt those who dont want peace to meddle so i am worried
6666381 there are both similarities and differences with the 1990s one interesting difference is the role of the amarnath land issue and of the jammu hindu community
6666382 the amarnath land grant got a lot of people stirred up but when the new governor n n vohra resolved that it was people from jammu who expanded the protest so far more than the previous episodes this one has local roots
6666383 especially if the indian state however belatedly manages to demonstrate a degree of dexterity in defusing the crisis
6666384 it has already shown after one or two initial missteps that it is capable of showing restraint even in the face of grave provocation
6666385 it needs to keep doing more of the same despite pressures from within elements of the national security establishment to adopt a harder line
6666386 it also needs to douse the flames in jammu as they tend to generate their own fires in the valley
6666387 the wild card in all of this remains both the islamists and the hindu zealots who thrive on each other follies and short sighted goals and actions
6666388 there have been a lot of reasons that go back several weeks as to how this thing flared up
6666389 there are those who do want to reverse the peace process
6666390 and with the distracted political leadership in pakistan i believe that some of these forces are beginning to assert themselves again
6666391 it is something for the us and the international community to watch
6666392 i am very concerned and clearly it has the potential to unravel and the situation is far more worrisome than it was earlier because american intelligence has conclusive evidence that elements associated with the isi were involved in planning and perhaps even carrying out the bombing of the indian embassy in kabul
6666393 the current upsurge in violence and in agitation is the result of conditions within both jammu and the valley itself and the increased violence and the increased tension in the valley was largely the result of developments within the valley so i could believe that i am not going to point the finger at pakistan because of that
6666394 it is not established that what has a principle of rectilinear inclination is prevented from having circular motion

6666408 a bloody next act in a screenplay that could be named how to destroy the investment story of one of the strongest credits in the emerging markets universe
6666409 people who were among the most bullish on russia are now ready to be the most aggressive in demonizing it

6666412 its too premature to provide any type of comment right now other than that weve been asked to investigate a situation between dugrenier and her coach
6666413 we have a process in place but beyond that any other comment on what it is were reviewing is a little premature right now
6666414 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6666415 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6666416 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6666417 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6666418 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6666419 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6666420 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6666421 the degree to which islamist extremists around the world have dropped their previous obsession with iraq and now focus on the afghan pakistan area has been astounding
6666422 no one recruiting for or seeking to join jihadist fighting in europe are trying to get to iraq its all afghanistan now
6666423 no one raising money for jihad is directing funds to iraq either the afghan pakistan region has regained the power of attraction it had prior to september 11
6666424 it was the original jihad against occupying infidels and it was long al qaedas terror sanctuary bin laden still lurks there somewhere
6666425 afghanistan isnt just about killing americans but fighting the assembled forces of the world they accuse of attacking islam
6666426 beyond the immediate human reaction to this loss of life this attack is most instructive in telling us about the rapidly rising strength and capacity of the people were up against
6666427 the taliban have been allowed to reconstitute and re arm themselves to levels nearing those prior to the invasion

6666450 produktudviklingen i pensionsbranchen synes at v re g et i st set i lyset af danskernes behov og krav p at f kompetent r dgivning med hensyn til deres pen pensionsopsparing er det tankev kkende at pensionsbranchens mest solgte produkt stadig er det traditionelle gennemsnitsrenteprodukt is r n r de fleste danskere kan placere deres pensionsopsparing langt mere optimalt i et markedsrenteprodukt

6666468 cloud computing is one of those catch all buzz words that tries to encompass a variety of aspects ranging from deployment load balancing provisioning business model and architecture like web2
6666469 i view cloud computing as a broad array of web based services aimed at allowing users to obtain a wide range of functional capabilities on a pay as you go basis that previously required tremendous hardware software investments and professional skills to acquire cloud computing is the realization of the earlier ideals of utility computing without the technical complexities or complicated deployment worries
6666470 i think clouds are the next hype term for the next year or two people are coming to grips with virtualization and how it reshapes it creates service and software based models and in many ways changes a lot of the physical layer we are used to clouds will be the next transformation over the next several years building off of the software models that virtualization enabled

6666486 its not as severe yet as in the early 1990s
6666487 they just sit there and say what should i do now
6666488 youre going to feel anger frustration or shame those emotions are normal but if you continue focusing on them the emotions tend to lead to actions that wont help
6666489 be aware of those emotions but focus on where you want to go in the future sometimes a layoff can be a good opportunity workers can reconsider their options
6666490 your short term goal may not be your long term goal
6666491 there are different levels of stress everyone has a limit where they fly off the deep end
6666492 gives them a grace period with a severance package tells them basically youre not going to go hungry right away
6666493 at the threat of layoffs the strongest employees jump ship the ones using outplacement services often are the weakest employees who need more help

6666496 when they passed their property tax cap and i dont blame them they might have passed it because they wanted to they might have passed it for political reasons
6666497 but for whatever reason they did it was immediate retrenchment
6666498 it was my fear it was the anxiety i expressed to senator skelos that wed wind up here
6666499 we voted for his property tax cap the assembly democrats did not agree with the democrat governor
6666500 we have to do something that gives relief to all of the property taxpayers in new york state not just the property taxpayers outside of the cities
6666501 the public is going to have to really speak out as to what they prefer
6666502 they are saying reductions in property taxes are less important than keeping tax rates down on millionaires
6666503 the way we want to frame this is assembly passes millionaire tax in order to provide tax cut to middle class
6666504 the reality is the cap isnt going anyplace and therefore wisdom says they will look at some compromise that will succeed
6666505 both houses are trying to demonstrate that they have a commitment to this issue because they know thats what voters want

6666565 the deniers the world renowned scientists who stood up against global warming hysteria political persecution and fraud
6666566 are trumpeting catastrophes that couldnt happen even if the models were right
6666567 the common view that mans industrial activity is a deciding factor in global warming has emerged from misinterpretation of cause and effect relations
6666568 the sun has been at its strongest over the past 60 years and may now be affecting global temperatures
6666569 how can a barely discernible one degree increase in the recorded global temperature since the late 19th century possibly gain public acceptance as the source of recent weather catastrophes
6666570 ambiguous scientific statements about climate are hyped by those with a vested interest in alarm thus raising the political stakes for policymakers who provide funds for more science research to feed more alarm to increase the political stakes
6666571 do a very poor job of describing the clouds the dust the chemistry and the biology of fields farms and forests they do not begin to describe the real world that we live in
6666572 mars has global warming but without a greenhouse and without the participation of martians
6666573 parallel global warmings observed simultaneously on mars and on earth can only be a straight line consequence of the effect of the one same factor a long time change in solar irradiance
6666574 we continue to bask in the remains of heat that the planet accumulated over the twentieth century
6666575 our research tells us the governments plans would have significant and unintended consequences for business we dont believe the government intended to design a scheme to achieve the outcome of businesses and jobs moving offshore but that would be the outcome of the governments plans
6666576 we want to ensure that industry plays its part but that the cost is kept at a level which allows them to stay in australia rather than move to a less demanding jurisdiction
6666577 at the end of the day weve got to understand there is not a bottomless pit of money here
6666578 serious questions need to be raised why the government should transfer billions of dollars of taxpayers revenue to businesses who have known an emissions trading scheme was coming over a decade ago
6666579 polluting industries that have spent the last decade doing little or nothing to prepare for a carbon constrained economy should not get a free kick
6666580 leaves too much scope for uncertainty for business to continue to invest in existing and new facilities
6666581 will be unlikely to invest while such outcomes are possible
6666582 queenslands economy is booming its appetite for electricity is growing faster than any other state in australia
6666583 its going to have to make decisions earlier than other states in terms of what the next generation of power plants are going to be
6666584 given 90 per cent of electricity comes from fossil fuel and in the future we cant use fossil fuels at least not to the same extent the creation of this group to stimulate an objective debate about nuclear power makes a lot of sense
6666585 nuclear energy has been going for 50 years but not many people know much about it
6666586 the idea is to be an education forum to help educate people on the pros and cons of nuclear energy
6666587 there is no logic i can see for queensland to not develop uranium reserves
6666588 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
6666589 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
6666590 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
6666591 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child
6666592 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
6666593 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

6666617 we havent made wembley our home yet thats the biggest thing
6666618 it feels like when were going out there its tough
6666619 every game is tough these days but we need to make it daunting for players and teams coming to wembley
6666620 we will get there we will build on that but its about getting the confidence up which will happen in the qualifiers
6666621 the manager thrives on challenges he wants the best out of the team and hell get that
6666622 people expect change straight away and it just doesnt happen like that
6666623 it is step by step its about bonding together as a team as a unit and that takes time

6666630 even if its not one of my titles heaven forbid a book as a party favor is practical and appreciated obviously a hostess isnt going to buy 16 copies of war and peace to thank guests for attending expensive and unwieldy which is why one of my novels is the perfect solution
6666631 the slim trade paperbacks fit easily into gift bags and i personalize each with the guests name and my signature the guest of honor receives an extra message appropriate to the occasion
6666632 if the event is taking place out of my area i send custom book plates with the same personalization for the hostess to affix to the books books can be ordered from any number of vendors as well as the publishers who offer a discount on high volume orders of 25 books or more
6666633 the theme of motherhood in far above rubies is appropriate for a baby shower or mothers day celebration the humor in remote control is good for bridal showers sweet sixteen parties any gathering of younger women even if a guest isnt interested in remote control or far above rubies im sure she can find a good use for it book donations are always welcome at many institutions and organizations but dont be too quick to give it away one of my autographed books will be worth a lot of money someday
6666634 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone
6666635 because there are so few conifers in this area of the trail no matter how often private citizens damage publicly owned trees it is always shocking
6666636 di mana dia saat aku kesusahan di mana dia saat aku membutuhkannya di mana dia yang selalu menyebut dirinya sahabat sejati yang akan menguatkan dan mendoakan sahabatnya
6666637 all the three ships are still moving and appear to be heading toward territorial water a warship has been dispatched to monitor and track the vessels
6666638 the united nations is the only agency that can stop this menace the international community has to agree to find ways to solve this worsening problem that is the only way forward
6666639 to look diverse and all that good p r stuff
6666640 the scale facility is closed for the day once we get everything cleaned up we will be able to see if we are going to open tomorrow or in a few days depending on what we need to repair
6666641 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6666642 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6666643 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6666644 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6666645 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6666646 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6666647 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6666648 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6666649 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6666650 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6666651 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6666652 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6666653 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6666654 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6666655 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6666656 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6666657 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6666658 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6666659 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6666660 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6666661 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6666662 if motoring is to be made sustainable the figure for cars must be cut to about 30g km but we will have the technology to achieve that by 2050
6666663 his holiness clearly stated we had no specific information on the number of casualties
6666664 it is quite worrying given that the credit crunch and cost of living has dominated the front pages for the past twelve months and people say that they are more interested in understanding their finance than ever before
6666665 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6666666 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6666667 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6666668 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6666669 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6666670 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6666671 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6666672 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6666673 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6666674 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6666675 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6666676 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6666677 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6666678 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6666679 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6666680 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6666681 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6666682 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6666683 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6666684 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6666685 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6666686 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6666687 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6666688 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6666689 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6666690 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6666691 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6666692 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6666693 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6666694 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6666695 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6666696 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6666697 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6666698 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6666699 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6666700 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6666701 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6666702 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6666703 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6666704 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6666705 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6666706 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6666707 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6666708 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6666709 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6666710 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6666711 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6666712 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6666713 alles erdenkliche tun um den t ter dingfest zu machen
6666714 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6666715 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6666716 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6666717 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6666718 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6666719 this is a planning took where all things are going
6666720 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6666721 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6666722 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6666723 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6666724 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6666725 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6666726 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6666727 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6666728 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6666729 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6666730 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6666731 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6666732 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6666733 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6666734 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6666735 weve only got two left and usually the last game starters dont play
6666736 this could be it i dont know for sure im just guessing
6666737 goose is one of the bestknown individuals in the sporting community who has ever called colorado springs home
6666738 one of the great things about goose is that this isnt some place that he came and retired to
6666739 what he did for the game of baseball the character he brought to the game of baseball is something i think is sorely missed with todays players he made you want to be a fan of baseball you rooted for this guy
6666740 hes a hall of famer we dont get to tout too many hall of famers from our own neighborhoods
6666741 five days later we met our new daughter nicki at the l a airport wearing the only clothing cindy could find on the trip back a 7 up t shirt she bought in the bangkok airport
6666742 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6666743 simple answer for mccain i own dozens of homes none of which was purchased with the assistance of organized crime
6666744 too different from and out of touch with the typical american
6666745 its easy for mccain to give a huge chunk of his six figure income to charity to make himself look good if his wife isnt doing the same with her 7 figure income you cant say thats not the case until she makes her records public as michelle has by means of their joint return
6666746 or what about cheating on your wife with a younger millionaire while your wife struggles to recover from a debilitating injury
6666747 it absolutely turns my stomach to hear read you imply that the mccains particularly cindy are not generous
6666748 in 2007 senator and mrs mccain donated 210 933 from community assets to charity of which senator mccains one half allocation is 105 467 this is 27 2 of his adjusted gross income for the year
6666749 note about mrs mccains financial information since the beginning of their marriage senator mccain and mrs mccain have always maintained separate finances as required by federal law and senate rules mrs mccain has released significant and extensive financial information through senate and presidential disclosure forms in the interest of protecting the privacy of her children mrs mccain will not be releasing her personal tax returns note about hensley amp company in her role as chairman of hensley amp company a privately held business founded by her parents mrs mccains main areas of responsibility focus on strategic planning and corporate vision having served the greater phoenix area since 1955 hensley amp company is widely respected as an exemplary corporate citizen and makes significant charitable contributions of its own
6666750 if my food shelter clothing and entertainment were paid for by my wifes fortune it would be very easy for me to give away 100 of my salary
6666751 the obama campaign is hardly desperate hell name his vp choice and get a huge lift from days of press coverage of the democratic convention starting monday
6666752 the other 105 467 is 1 7 of cindy mccains adjusted gross income
6666753 matt and lucy damon had a baby girl named gia zavala on wednesday aug 20th everyones doing great
6666754 i put everything into this and i couldnt have done any more
6666755 ive fallen off and got back up ive fallen off and got back up i gave it my heart and everything but today it wasnt good enough
6666756 i was expecting to be the second guy and learning the ropes and everything
6666757 i guess the hardest thing for me is people are actually counting on me and looking up to me being a freshman last year you get treated like dirt run all the reps now people actually look up to me and ask me questions and they look for me to make plays
6666758 hes more confident than ever with whats going on and now he can really play fast
6666759 were seeing a different speed out of him now that hes comfortable
6666760 last year our goals were too far ahead of us
6666761 were setting short term goals this year and taking things one step at a time
6666762 our goals are to have a good training session we havent had a bad session in preseason which is a rare thing were not looking toward the big finish if we stick to the basics well do very well
6666763 we tried to set that tone since spring but theyre the ones that have to instill it
6666764 i saw him down and the ball rolling toward center field
6666765 he threw more fastballs and a lot of changeups he was pretty much down in the zone
6666766 the development and role of surfing in each beach town along the orange county coast

6666768 we liked the way pavano was throwing the ball and we felt that hughes needed some more work
6666769 hes pitched in big games before hes pitched in the playoffs youre not talking about a kid coming up that is a rookie and doesnt have a ton of innings under his belt in the big leagues
6666770 we were pleased by the report that there was not a significant injury to the elbow or shoulder that would prevent tom from pitching in the future
6666771 hes healthy playing well obviously getting the at bats that he needs
6666772 il ne fera pas de discours il participera des activit s telles quemballer des repas pour la banque alimentaire locale et il participera aussi un panel de discussion sur la fa on de combattre la pauvret dans le monde

6666813 it was a fantastic performance against portsmouth which is the main thing but it is only one game and we have to keep our feet on the floor
6666814 we needed a mass high through put system the longer a serious disease goes undiagnosed the harder it is to treat and the further it can spread
6666815 being able to get such quick results for so many pathogens at once will become critical in case of bioterrorism under that scenario every minute counts in providing treatment or preventing disease spread
6666816 once the games are complete we will be conducting a comprehensive review of all our programs

6666854 sebenarnya dapatkah anda mengatakan kepada saya apa yang umat buddha percayai
6666855 itulah mengapa saya menulis buku ini untuk anda membacanya untuk melihat apakah ada sesuatu yang anda percayai
6666856 ketika saya melihat tubuh fisik sang bhagava hal itu memberikanku banyak kebahagiaan
6666857 bakkula dengan memandangi tubuh fisik yang kotor menjijikkan tidak kekal ini apa yang kau dapatkan engkau hanya menyenangkan perasaanmu saja engkau tidak akan pernah mencapai pengetahuan atau pemahaman tetapi menyenangkan perasaanmu engkau tidak dapat melihat buddha yang sesungguhnya melalui tubuh fisik buddha bukanlah tubuh fisik
6666858 hanya ia yang memahami dhamma yang diajarkan oleh sang buddha melihat buddha yang sebenarnya
6666859 untuk menghargai pertunjukkanmu saya ingin menaruh rangkaian kalung bunga ini ke lehermu
6666860 tidaklah sukar tetapi saya hanya dapat melakukannya dengan 2 kondisi pertama engkau harus berjanji di masa yang akan datang engkau tidak akan mengganggu apapun terhadap kegiatan keagamaan kami
6666861 hal kedua yaitu engkau telah melihat sang buddha karena dalam beberapa kesempatan kau berusaha mengganggu sang buddha kau hidup beberapa ratus tahun setelah sang buddha kau memiliki kekuatan batin untuk menampilkan tubuh fisik sang buddha
6666862 ya saya akan melakukannya jika anda berjanji untuk tidak menyembahku ketika aku muncul sebagai sang buddha karena aku bukanlah orang yang suci
6666863 simpanlah patung ini di atas meja anda kapan pun anda merasa khawatir atau permasalahan lihatlah pada wajah patung ini saya yakin anda akan dapat menenangkan pikiran anda
6666864 dalam kejengkelan atas begitu banyak gangguan permasalahan dan kesusahan di dunia ini jika sang buddha dapat mengatur memelihara wajah tersenyumnya mengapa kita tidak meneladani manusia agung ini
6666865 jika tuhan telah turun ke bumi dari surga ia tidak lain adalah sosok ini
6666866 apakah sang buddha muncul atau tidak dharma tetap ada selamanya di dunia ini
6666867 dharma yang saya pahami ini bukanlah dharma yang diciptakan olehku
6666868 kemarahan ini berbahaya dapat menimbulkan banyak masalah gangguan dan kesulitan dan menyakiti dan mengganggu yang lain saya harus berusaha mengurangi rasa marah dengan kekuatan batin saya dan menimbulkan keinginan kuat untuk menarik kemarahan dari pikiran
6666869 bagaimana engkau bisa katakan bahwa kau telah berhenti saya melihatmu berjalan
6666870 saya telah berhenti berarti saya telah berhenti membunuh atau menghancurkan kehidupan makhluk hidup kau yang berlari berarti kau masih melakukan kejahatan jika kau berhenti berlari maka kau dapat menangkapku
6666871 saya telah berhenti membunuh dan kau masih melakukannya itulah artinya berlari kau berlari dalam samsara

6666875 the greatest benefits and least risk from hrt are seen in the 99 percent of women who commence hrt for symptom relief near menopause this trial studied much older women who started hrt on average 13 to 14 years after menopause when they had fewer symptoms even in this group improved quality of life was seen in many taking hrt
6666876 i think this is an important study because since whi many have lost sight of the significant benefits of hormone therapy
6666877 this study reinforces the notion that for women with these symptoms hrt can improve your quality of life and the worse your symptoms the more theyll improve
6666878 for relief of symptoms its ok to go on hrt as long as you have none of the absolute contraindications like a history of deep vein thrombosis

6666912 we have known for some time that young and middle aged adults who are overweight run a higher risk of death and it was presumed that this held true for older people in fact our results show that the risk of dying is higher only for the most severely obese but that all older people who are overweight are at significantly increased risk of developing problems with mobility and carrying out everyday tasks
6666913 this research is important because a growing proportion of the population is aged 65 or over and more and more of these older people are overweight in fact in most developed countries middle aged and elderly adults are more likely to be obese than people in any other age group these findings have huge significance for the delivery of health care both now and in the future increasing numbers of older people and higher levels of overweight and obesity will lead to a greater burden of disability and ill health and place an immense strain on health and social services the issue is likely to get worse as time goes on and represents a ticking time bomb for health services around the world
6666914 staying a healthy weight can be a fun and relatively easy thing to do even as people get older
6666915 our experience of running supported walking and cycling groups has shown that older people benefit in many ways from regular physical activity
6666916 people are living longer but this study shows that excess weight can have a real impact on the quality of peoples lives which can reduce the benefit of those extra years we must do all we can to encourage older friends or relatives to build enjoyable exercise into their daily routine and develop good habits ourselves to take into our retirement years people can visit www strollbacktheyears info or www healthpromcornwall org 01209 313419 for more advice

6666925 it is a truth universally acknowledged that a thirty something woman in possession of a satisfying career and fabulous hairdo must be in want of very little and jane hayes pretty enough and clever enough was certainly thought to have little to distress her there was no husband but those werent necessary anymore there were boyfriends and if they came and went in a regular stream of mutual dissatisfaction well that was the way of things wasnt it but jane had a secret by day she bustled and luncheoned and emailed and over timed and just in timed but sometimes when she had the time to slip off her consignment store pumps and lounge on her hand me down sofa she dimmed the lights turned on her nine inch television and acknowledged what was missing sometimes she watched pride and prejudice you know the bbc double dvd version starring colin firth as the delicious mr darcy and that comely busty english actress as the elizabeth bennet we had imagined all along jane watched and re watched the part where elizabeth and mr darcy look at each other over the piano and theres that zing and her face softens and he smiles his chest heaving as though hed breathe in the sight of her and his eyes are glistening so that youd almost think hed cry ah each time janes heart banged her skin chilled and she clamped down on the distracting ache in her gut with a bowl of something naughty like cocoa pebbles that night she would dream of gentlemen in abraham lincoln hats and then in the morning laugh at herself and toy with the idea of hauling those dvds and all her austen books to the second hand store of course she never did that pesky movie version was the culprit sure jane had first read pride and prejudice when she was sixteen read it a dozen times since and read the other austen novels at least twice except northanger abbey of course but it wasnt until the bbc put a face on the story that those gentlemen in tight breeches had stepped out of her readers imagination and into her non fiction hopes stripped of austens funny insightful biting narrator the movie became a pure romance and pride and prejudice was the most stunning bite your hand romance ever the kind that stared straight into janes soul and made her shudder it was embarrassing she didnt really want to talk about it so lets move on

6666933 the water sector is one of most corrupt after health and education
6666934 thats because the poor often dont have a voice in strategic water policy decisions
6666935 the water is often delivered in trucks or pushcarts by entrepreneurs who in some cases secure supplies illegally from a bigger water company
6666936 in agriculture nearly 25 percent of irrigation contracts in india involve some kind of corrupt deal mostly with the government
6666937 lack of access to clean water is not just about scarcity more than anything it is because of failing governments
6666938 it is the petty corruption which generally involves local police and officials that affects people everyday

6666941 many of you have written to me to express your disappointment in our moving harry potter and the half blood prince to summer 2009
6666942 please be assured that we share your love for harry potter and would certainly never do anything to hurt any of the films over the past ten years we have nurtured and protected each film and the integrity of the books upon which they are based to the best of our ability he added

6666945 we will not try to bring the government down but of course we then have no choice but to sit in the opposition i would very much like to see this coalition stay in tact i would be the last person who wants to see it disintegrating
6666946 i gave these a b because it does what it says it will in terms of preserving your fruit and vegetables a little longer but it didnt make that much of a difference these bags kept my bananas fresh for about four to five days longer than a traditional bag and for about a week longer than no bag at all the strawberries made it three days longer in the green bags than with the plastic carton they came in after two weeks i noticed no real difference in my lettuce or tomatoes they do keep things fresher but not by such a huge margin that its worth my extra money for the bags
6666947 i ended up giving this a c because they said you could make a coffee handle so i tried that and it broke right off it did a good job in terms of connecting two irrigation pipes and it worked and prevented water seepage but it didnt give me a lot of confidence it didnt seem to be a money saver for me i used the putty to make a handle for my coffee cup but even after allowing the putty to harden completely the handle came off the cup and my mug broke
6666948 i gave them a c the reason being theres a logic issue here it didnt really work on heavy objects it only worked on light objects and you dont really need the help for light objects i couldnt move a heavy chest of drawers on it at all and i tried to move my old jeep and it did not budge at all these make moving furniture on carpet easier for smaller items the moving men coasters did seem to reduce friction and make it easier for me to push or pull items into place but for really heavy things on hardwood floors i didnt get much help from the moving men and the whole point is that theyre supposed to help you move heavy things
6666949 i gave it a c the idea is that it allows you to use your computer and plug a regular phone into your computer to use the internet so it feels like youre using a regular phone overall it works ok with decent call quality with some delay and a few drop outs and its pretty easy to get it up and running the average phone bill for u s residents is 40 a month using the magic jack you pay 40 for the product plus 6 95 for shipping and handling which includes a year of free local and long distance calling to u s and canadian numbers after that its 20 a year so its technically cheaper than a landline the cons if youre the kind of person like me who doesnt want to miss a call and want them to go to voice mail you would have to pay the electricity costs to keep your computer on and that could raise your bill the 911 function is a little confusing to set up if you dont set up 911 the dispatcher wont know your address if you call it just didnt seem to measure up to what they promise

6666955 a total of 15 556 subjects answered the questions on snoring habitual snoring defined as loud and disturbing snoring at least three nights a week was reported by 18 percent
6666956 these factors may enhance inflammatory processes and thereby alter upper airway anatomy early in life causing an increased susceptibility for adult snoring
6666957 people who snore run an increased risk of early death and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks or strokes
6666958 these new findings suggest that further knowledge about the early life environment may contribute to the primary prevention of snoring
6666959 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments is not uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it we were surprised to learn that we had found a new virus
6666960 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are many years away

6666962 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6666963 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6666964 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
6666965 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed

6667001 i am the last born of a big family and also a twin my parents were in the navy so we traveled around a bit and then decided to settle in georgia no i am not a peach per se but
6667002 i was born and raised a redneck from the south in my home town of wichita kansas but i now live in michigan i enjoy football camping occasionally visiting the casino and playing pogo games
6667003 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
6667004 tiga hal itu yang mesti menjadi fokus panitia hak angket dpr
6667005 kalau cost recovery tahun 2008 sudah dialokasikan 10 miliar dolar as dengan ditekan 10 20 persen maka penghematan uang negara bisa mencapai 1 2 miliar dolar as
6667006 seharusnya item cost recovery yang ditekan menyangkut operasi berupa pengadaan barang dan sewa peralatan
6667007 tugas panitia angket untuk membuktikan apakah memang ada atau tidak mafia minyak
6667008 kalau satu persennya bernilai rp2 5 triliun maka penghematan bisa rp7 5 10 triliun
6667009 mesti ada standar berapa kali gangguan suplai atau pemadaman listrik dalam setahun yang memang layak
6667010 with our technology we can image specific cells in real time with exquisite selectivity which allows us to track their location and movement and to count the apparent number of cells present we then use conventional mri to obtain a high resolution image that places the labeled cells in their anatomical context
6667011 the large background signal from mobile water and intrinsic tissue contrast differences can often make it challenging to unambiguously identify regions containing these metal ion labeled cells throughout the body which is the current state of the art
6667012 right now were using our technology to image key cell types involved in autoimmune diseases like type i diabetes but our cellular mri agents also can be adapted to label other cell types including cells from bone marrow and stem cells a key long term application of our technology is to label and monitor cell based therapeutics in humans
6667013 ideally we would label therapeutic cells with our cellular mri agents before they are implanted into a patient in this way we could use mri to visualize the movement of the therapeutic cells in the patient to monitor whether they migrate to and remain in the desired tissues
6667014 if we agree its 98 percent right i dont want the perfect to get in the way of the good

6667047 kondisi pertama yaitu kau harus berjanji untuk tidak mengganggu para penganut di masa depan kondisi kedua yaitu kau harus menunjukkan kepadaku wujud sang buddha yang sebenarnya karena saya tahu engkau pernah melihat sang buddha dalam beberapa kesempatan tapi saya tidak pernah melihatnya saya ingin melihat wujud sebenarnya dari sang buddha sama persis dengan 32 tanda istimewa yang terdapat pada fisiknya
6667048 jika saya merubah diri saya menjadi rupa sang buddha kau harus berjanji untuk tidak akan menyembah saya kerena saya bukan orang suci sepertimu
6667049 engkau berjanji tidak akan menyembah saya sekarang kenapa kau menyembah saya
6667050 saya tidak menyembahmu kau harus memahami saya sedang menyembah sang buddha
6667051 engkau tidak dapat melihat buddha yang sebenarnya dengan hanya melihat tubuh fisiknya saja mereka yang melihat ajaran saya maka melihat saya
6667052 apakah layak yang mulia untuk membangun sebuah pagoda ketika sang bhagava masih hidup
6667053 tidak adalah tidak layak ketika saya masih hidup engkau bisa membangun objek penghormatan ini hanya setelah saya tiada
6667054 matanya tertutup tetapi ada suatu kekuatan spiritual yang keluar dari matanya dan energi vital memenuhi strukturnya banyak jaman bergulir dan nampaknya sang buddha tidak pergi terlalu jauh suarannya berbisik di telinga kita dan memberitahu kita supaya jangan lari dari perjuangan tetapi menghadapinya dengan pandangan tenang dan melihat peluang peluang besar dalam hidup untuk terus berkembang dan maju
6667055 semasa saya berada di dalam penjara saya sentiasa memikirkan tentang rupang gambar patung buddha yang merupakan sumber inspirasi yang luar biasa untuk saya
6667056 ketika anda khawatir lihatlah rupang yang wajahnya begitu tenang dan tersenyumlah kepada kekhawatiran anda
6667057 saya tidak mengetahui hal lain yang lebih agung di dunia ini selain dari figur seorang buddha yang merupakan suatu penjelmaan spiritual yang sungguh sempurna di dalam dunia nyata visible domain
6667058 rupang gambar patung buddha yang kita lihat merupakan suatu simbol yang mewakili kualitas pujian dan penghormatan kepada sang buddha tidak lain merupakan suatu simbol penghargaan atas keagungan dan kebahagian yang kita ketemui melalui ajarannya
6667059 kita juga perlu memberi penghormatan meskipun pemujaan itu diarahkan bukan untuk seorang karena sebenarnya semua personalitas merupakan mimpi tetapi pemujaan itu diarahkan kepada kesesuaian hati kita dengan itu kita dapat menemui kekuatan baru dan membangun mahligai kehidupan kita sendiri membersihkan hati kita sampai layak untuk membawa rupang tersebut di dalam tempat perlindungan kasih sayang yang mendalam di atas altarnya kita semua perlu mempersembahkan hadiah bukan cahaya yang padam bunga bunga yang layu tetapi tindakan kasih sayang pengorbanan dan tanpa keakuan terhadap semua yang berada di sekeliling kita
6667060 di awal bulan mei 1890 kesempatan membawaku untuk mengunjungi sebuah musium di paris di sana berdiri dewa dewa asia dalam kesunyian dan kesederhanaan pandanganku jatuh pada patung sang buddha yang memberi isyarat kepada penderitaan manusia untuk mengembangkan pemahaman dan belas kasih jika ada tuhan yang pernah berjalan di atas muka bumi ini saya merasakan beliaulah buddha orangnya saya merasa seperti berlutut dan berdoa kepadanya seperti kepada tuhan
6667061 rupang buddha ini merupakan suatu bagian seni yang sungguh istimewa saya tidak mengetahui hasil karya seni lainnya yang sejajar dengan rupang buddha dengan mata dari batu safir dimana sepengetahuan saya tidak ada karya seni yang dapat mengekspresikan dengan sempurna idea suatu agama seperti wajah rupang buddha yang mengekspresikan ide buddhisme
6667062 tidak perlu membaca banyak buku tentang buddhisme atau berjalan bersama dengan para professor yang mempelajari agama agama timur atau belajar dengan para bhikkhu seseorang harus datang ke sini berdiri di hadapan rupang buddha ini dan biarkan pancaran mata birunya menembus kehidupannya dan dia akan memahami apa itu buddhisme

6667067 statement of issues to the proposed deals likely impact on the iron ore trade and in particular on australian steel makers
6667068 the acccs market inquiries indicated that the proposed acquisition may raise competition concerns in relation to the global seaborne supply of iron ore lump and iron ore fines the watchdog said in a statement posted on its website
6667069 to the extent the proposed acquisition lessens competition in the global seaborne supply of iron ore it would be likely to have the effect of increasing global iron ore prices which would in turn increase prices paid by steel makers in australia
6667070 interested parties also expressed concern that there would appear to be few alternative suppliers capable of supplying significant quantities of iron ore lump and iron ore fines at a cost that would be likely to impose an effective competitive constraint on the merged firm across the anticipated business cycle the statement added
6667071 in particular vale would be the only other supplier involved in annual benchmark price negotiations

6667080 well you owe me five cents times two and then you owe me one cent so
6667081 okay so i owe you five cents plus five cents what is the total
6667082 so taking into account that i owe you ten cents and you owe me one cent whats the final amount that i owe you whats the net debt
6667083 that amount that ten cents less the one cent that i owe you thats called net debt what is my net debt to you

6667099 we lost the ball in a bad spot on the field
6667100 we were a little bit thin tonight with the loss of some players not that thats an excuse because chicago was missing some pretty good players as well but the thing that im pleased about with the guys is that they hung in there and fought for 90 minutes
6667101 overall tonight the effort was good the organization of the team was certainly improved but not good enough were missing a few players at the attacking end of the field

6667162 because of the partitioning the boot loader cannot be installed properly
6667163 students may be more inclined to learn life changing behaviors from someone they know and trust
6667164 the actual person teaching makes a difference in how students learn when there is a good relationship that really facilitates learning and motivation and we found that in almost every area the regular classroom teachers were more effective they were better
6667165 the relationship between the teacher and the student particularly during adolescence is very important it was easier for the kids to talk about personal stuff with someone they knew it was easier for them to absorb the material and become more interested in what they were talking about with their regular teacher in the classroom
6667166 when you have kids who simply memorize material for the test and two weeks later dont remember any of it youre not getting anywhere but if you can get the kids to care and learn because they think its important thats something that will last a lifetime
6667167 students who had a sexual partner were more likely to say that there was class discussion going on with the regular teacher than those taught by the outside person these kids were more likely to feel like there was discussion of these issues rather than just the teacher lecturing to them
6667168 school is the absolute best way to get information out to adolescents no matter who is teaching the important thing is getting the teacher to make a connection if the teacher can make the right connection with one kid youve saved one person from getting hiv youve saved one persons life

6667175 everyone saw what bristol city did last season so we know what you can expect from a team that has just come up

6667177 the championship is well underway and already it has been predictably unpredictable on their day anyone can beat anyone and i think its going to be as open a league as it was last year
6667178 conundrum qpr have also brought a lot of new faces in but theyre a conundrum to me everyones tipping them so much that im questioning why im not but i just think there have been too many changes it looks like a case of throwing a pack of cards in the air and seeing how they settle and as we saw with bristol city last season the championship is about teamwork organisation and application even if iain dowie does get qpr promotion its been mooted that the owners want a bigger name and if youre working under that sort of pressure it doesnt matter how driven you are as much they seem to be fancied i cant see them even being in the play offs it is refreshing for the division as a whole though that even with the relegated clubs parachute payments anyone on a given day can beat anyone its not like the premier league where you cant see anyone really breaking into the top four and thats the beauty of the championship

6667409 u s officials not surprisingly considered the operation one of their greatest foreign policy successes until that is the enormous convulsion that rocked iranian society with the violent ouster of the shah and the installation of a virulently anti american islamic regime in 1979
6667410 in 1953 the united states played a significant role in orchestrating the overthrow of irans popular prime minister mohammed mossadegh the eisenhower administration believed its actions were justified for strategic reasons but the coup was clearly a setback for irans political development and it is easy to see now why many iranians continue to resent this intervention by america in their internal affairs
6667411 our draft resolution is a reconfirmation of the six point agreement and theres no territorial integrity in the six principles
6667412 we believe the six principles are clear and already implemented
6667413 what we see on the ground is the result of ambiguity
6667414 we have a presence of so called russian peacekeeping forces at key georgian choke points that will control economic life it will control humanitarian activities thats why clarifications are so important
6667415 theres no way that russian positions can be considered in line with the resolution

6667425 nous avons re u une notification des russes par les canaux militaires disant quils avaient d cid darr ter les op rations militaires de coop ration internationale entre la russie et les pays de lotan
6667426 tout d pend des priorit s de lotan si ces priorit s vont un soutien inconditionnel au r gime en faillite du pr sident g orgien saakachvili et si le prix quils les pays de lotan sont pr ts payer est la rupture des relations avec la russie ce nest pas notre choix
6667427 je ne peux pas imaginer dans les circonstances actuelles que nous nous engagions dans une coop ration militaire avec les russes tant que la situation en g orgie nest pas r solue

6667430 i think that the relationship between people that are great is they have a common thread of knowing how to beat their competitors and they know how to constantly be in shape and in top form
6667431 i would never disrespect a colleague and friend with that kind of language barber said from beijing through an msnbc spokeswoman who said barber had no idea of a budding controversy until she informed him of it
6667432 its disappointing someone would intentionally misrepresent the hard work jenna and i are doing
6667433 tiki and jenna were discussing total medal count versus gold medal counts and tikis words were unclear
6667434 i have to thank chad mccumbee and terry labonte for their efforts in the no 45 wells fargo dodge over the last several races
6667435 they have moved the team up to the 39th position in the owner points standings and were in position to move up a few more if we can keep improving i know it hasnt been easy on the crew all three of us have different driving styles so they havent been able to get into much of a rhythm its just a testament to how hard this team works
6667436 i pretty much knew that was going to happen to me sooner or later i knew i was going to get it the worst
6667437 we were trying to make a cake albert added the flour and the water we didnt have any eggs we added the honey and the chocolate syrup and albert came out of left field with the ketchup the mustard and the mayonnaise
6667438 were fortunate to have the sponsorship from hefty brand which allows mostly a full time ride
6667439 but you only get one chance anymore and have to be careful not to be labeled
6667440 in years past you didnt get the first opportunity until you were around 30
6667441 the more well funded independent teams will often go for a veteran driver or a sprint cup driver its getting to where the only way to break in as a driver is to come with sponsorship or have a very wealthy parent the amount of money will determine what opportunity you get
6667442 its getting harder and harder for drivers to get opportunities
6667443 as such the sprint cup teams will develop someone occasionally but usually put their cup drivers in the nationwide cars in order to get the amount of sponsorship dollars they command

6667455 we are disappointed that nascar chose to place our drivers on probation as they had no knowledge or involvement of this incident
6667456 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6667457 in our game we are always on trial and results tend to dictate that
6667458 we have been working hard on our culture development and leadership which we feel needed a little bit of improvement
6667459 the players have really responded to that to that end i genuinely believe that the pressure going into the season is on the other welsh regions
6667460 we have very little to prove weve won trophies have a lot of players involved in international rugby for our nation and were very proud of that and long may we continue to do that
6667461 going into the season were looking for consistency and a steady improvement
6667462 with the signings made and lack of silverware in the other regions then the pressure is completely on those this season
6667463 the money the region has spent shows ambition and it is now down to the players to perform on the field and take the step forward
6667464 a major factor is our strength in depth we have quality players in all positions whereas maybe in the past we did not and had to throw the youngsters in
6667465 hopefully this year we can pick and choose when to blood them

6667503 de meeste energie die verloren gaat wordt omgezet in warmte en daar heb je als computergebruiker niets aan
6667504 zonder te zeggen dat hij dicht moet kunnen we wel een energiecentrale besparen
6667505 gemiddeld komt de besparing overeen met twee spaarlampen die je zes uur per dag laat branden
6667506 zij hebben daar een capaciteitsprobleem en deze technieken helpen de overbelasting van het netwerk tegen te gaan computerfabrikanten worden gesponsord door de industrie om met energiezuinige technieken aan de slag te gaan

6667508 we husband buddy had two incomes go down to one and then with prices going up we realized we needed a little extra help
6667509 every free minute i get i run home and start working on someones doll house
6667510 that money could buy groceries pay a car note and a couple of utility bills
6667511 i started out making puppets for a little girl across the street and it kind of evolved into a personal art form for me
6667512 i run the line between politics fashion and rock stars
6667513 felt is so cozy and cute it translates well with serious fellows like politicians
6667514 since opening my shop mid july i have made enough money for weekly groceries
6667515 i think the economy is probably influencing people to use their creativity to make money as college student there is not really extra money but it allows me to pay bills buy more supplies and take my lady to dinner

6667520 come down here you can watch the street people play at night
6667521 thats probably the most disheartening thing that unfortunately they have the perception that they need to leave the area
6667522 what we need to do i think is provide an environment where bad behavior isnt tolerated
6667523 if you ever expect that downtown to get cleaned up you better concentrate in this midtown area
6667524 if i ever got asked to host the espys i would want some demands met
6667525 he anwar will win for sure because everybody knows the sodomy case is just a trick by the government and its his home ground
6667526 my guess is the majority will be slightly reduced because of dirty politics but some of my customers seem to be too idealistic and maybe they want some change in government since they are asking to bet on higher majorities
6667527 we need to factor in that the government will spend a lot of money trying to buy over voters and its a three way fight which is always a spoiler
6667528 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently

6667541 its way too early to talk about this being a viable product category
6667542 im not sure how much of a market there is for them particularly with subnotebooks like macbook air with larger keyboards and displays getting thinner and lighter and you can get some real work done on say an iphone or a nokia e series smart phone
6667543 the eee pc has successfully explored user segments that have been ignored by other notebook vendors
6667544 for example a lot of kids use their parents notebooks but they are just too heavy to carry to school but at two pounds kids can easily put ultraportables in their backpacks
6667545 but we would be remiss in our duty not to have a plan in place
6667546 the pacific island countries will need to be vigilant to protect the forum organization from becoming a foreign policy tool of these two countries
6667547 each one of us as the citizens of this country must now ask are we going to be bullied and pressured into doing things that are clearly not in our national interest

6667551 durch das zootier kann deutlich gemacht werden welcher zusammenhang zwischen klimawandel und kosystemen besteht
6667552 es ist nat rlich nicht so dass der pate jederzeit vorbei kommen kann um das tier zu knuddeln
6667553 um zum einen auf die un naturschutzkonferenz aufmerksam zu machen und zum anderen den engen zusammenhang zwischen dem schutz der biologischen vielfalt und dem klimaschutz einer breiten ffentlichkeit zu verdeutlichen
6667554 die blo en sechs punkte ohne klarstellungen ohne anzeichen f r ihre einhaltung werfen die frage auf warum wir den rat etwas festschreiben lassen sollten an das sich nicht gehalten wird
6667555 wir sagten macht es nicht lasst euch nicht in einen milit rischen konflikt ziehen das ist nicht in eurem interesse
6667556 sie hatten den eindruck handeln zu m ssen und das gab russland eine rechtfertigung f r einen gro en milit reinsatz mit ber 20 000 soldaten
6667557 die afghanistan kooperation mit br ssel stehe nicht zur diskussion teilte der generalstab in moskau mit
6667558 ive made the selection and that s all you re going to get
6667559 that said we do believe there is a large disruption going on in the private loan market that has not fully come to the forefront of the press i know there is an article this week in the wall street journal about that we believe that there is a vacuum of private loans that are not there and that students are going to be struggling to try to replace them coming up in the months of august and september as they realize that they cant get private loan financing due to the credit crisis
6667560 sure thats a really good question we have liquidity to make loans as we talked about for the upcoming 08 09 lending season remember there are over 7 5 million students and growing which require about 80 billion of new loan financing each year so yes it is possible that the abs market takes a prolonged period to recover if this occurs and the temporary government fix that is in place is not extended to the next year for those 7 5 million students then well need to re evaluate our position at that time and ill remind you that we are in the business to make a proper return based on the risk profile of our investments so every decision we make at that point in time will be based upon that criteria
6667561 the second significant item for the quarter was reduced operating expenses we continue to aggressively manage our operating costs and have decreased them by more than 20 million or 18 compared to the second quarter of last year and 40 million year to date
6667562 now there are a whole bunch of factors affecting new volume and let me just list some of the things that are going on that affect the volume
6667563 let me give you some more data points to think about we have seen 124 lenders exit the loan generation market in the last six months we have seen virtually all remaining lenders follow us on the elimination of borrowed benefits and weve offset inaudible just in the last couple of months seeing a significant amount of new lender list wins take all that and the ultimate impact to our volume from the combination of these decisions is very difficult to predict at this time
6667564 our two largest single month s for disbursement is august and september those two months that we believe thats why by the next call well have a real clear sight of what our volume is going to be for the year
6667565 my son was full of life he had so much more to give
6667566 people are shocked that such a talent like this is gone in the snap of a finger
6667567 i am not going to let it go lawrence vargas is going to be bigger than ever now
6667568 theres a lot of power i guess in being able to say this is my wife were married
6667569 i wish that my marriage would be recognized i wish laura would have the rights that all married people have
6667570 when the legal opinions came in we said no matter what happens in november we really think these marriages from june to november are going to stick
6667571 i can only say wouldnt it be ridiculous if my parents moved here from wisconsin and their marriage wasnt valid in colorado
6667572 the water sector is one of most corrupt after health and education
6667573 that s because the poor often don t have a voice in strategic water policy decisions
6667574 the water is often delivered in trucks or pushcarts by entrepreneurs who in some cases secure supplies illegally from a bigger water company
6667575 in agriculture nearly 25 percent of irrigation contracts in india involve some kind of corrupt deal mostly with the government
6667576 lack of access to clean water is not just about scarcity more than anything it is because of failing governments
6667577 it is the petty corruption which generally involves local police and officials that affects people everyday
6667578 the people of sunsari district have been victimised by the indian governments bully nature
6667579 nothin much they got fucked it s what they call survival
6667580 if you hurt then time will heal it amp if you fake time will reveal it
6667581 only britain estonia and the netherlands are ahead of switzerland other countries such as germany or austria have not even staged trials with e voting
6667582 every attempt to unify and centralise the system or change old habits has failed since the 1848 constitution
6667583 every swiss abroad has the right to documentation in the official languages of his or her canton in other words we need an it system with thousands of links and translations for navigation between the different language versions
6667584 politicians tend to think twice about the impact of a change in the voting system in a structure with so many players and decision makers as switzerland
6667585 they dont trust the widespread perception that e voting has no impact on voters preferences for a particular political party
6667586 we have to start modestly if we want to avoid nullifying the result of elections or a nationwide vote because of technical or security problems
6667587 on a personal level i almost feel like ive been socked in the stomach not by anyone by myself
6667588 i think i wrote and could have kept writing so i wouldnt have to do the last paragraph
6667589 i need to take care of my family i need to make a living
6667590 those infrastructure things are important for the quality of life and im real proud of them
6667591 we needed a mass high through put system the longer a serious disease goes undiagnosed the harder it is to treat and the further it can spread
6667592 being able to get such quick results for so many pathogens at once will become critical in case of bioterrorism under that scenario every minute counts in providing treatment or preventing disease spread
6667593 love the glory love the pain love sport even when it breaks your heart
6667594 immediately asked relevant government departments to investigate those that started the rumour
6667595 to look diverse and all that good p r stuff
6667596 but we would be remiss in our duty not to have a plan in place
6667597 the pacific island countries will need to be vigilant to protect the forum organization from becoming a foreign policy tool of these two countries
6667598 each one of us as the citizens of this country must now ask are we going to be bullied and pressured into doing things that are clearly not in our national interest

6667602 its the same situation almost every time when people are crossing tower there is a blind spot and they keep going and get hit we have met with our council people and have requested many times to have a traffic light installed but we have been told that since there are two in close proximity that it would not be feasible i think the numbers prove that a light is desperately needed something is needed for this intersection
6667603 she told me that she didnt see the girl she just didnt see her she said she looked but just didnt see her its because of the blind spot there i have lived here for a long time so i am familiar with it but i am still extremely cautious when i am going through there i just wish the city would do something about a month ago a man from down the street was involved in a similar crash here and he passed away while at metro i just dont know what it will take to get something done
6667604 might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities

6667606 simply based on somebodys race religion or exercise of first amendment rights
6667607 this document clarifies the rules by which the f b i conducts its intelligence mission
6667608 this seems to be based on the idea that the government can take a bunch of data and create a profile that can be used to identify future bad guys
6667609 but that has not been demonstrated to be true anywhere else
6667610 the killing of women by extremists and the taliban over suspicion of their character even for talking to men outside of their family has not been unknown in the tribal areas

6667612 there are a number of reasons for sals decision not to go ahead with the contract prime among them is a call by sietas shipyard for a hike in the agreed price because of escalating raw material costs

6667614 to the extent the proposed acquisition lessens competition in the global seaborne supply of iron ore it would be likely to have the effect of increasing global iron ore prices
6667615 statement of issues to the proposed deals likely impact on the iron ore trade and in particular on australian steel makers
6667616 the acccs market inquiries indicated that the proposed acquisition may raise competition concerns in relation to the global seaborne supply of iron ore lump and iron ore fines the watchdog said in a statement posted on its website
6667617 to the extent the proposed acquisition lessens competition in the global seaborne supply of iron ore it would be likely to have the effect of increasing global iron ore prices which would in turn increase prices paid by steel makers in australia
6667618 interested parties also expressed concern that there would appear to be few alternative suppliers capable of supplying significant quantities of iron ore lump and iron ore fines at a cost that would be likely to impose an effective competitive constraint on the merged firm across the anticipated business cycle the statement added
6667619 in particular vale would be the only other supplier involved in annual benchmark price negotiations

6667631 some good some bad im getting a better grasp of the offense each week each practice we had great blocking especially when youre playing a front like that thats where it all starts
6667632 an area that was the strength of our team last year has had problems the last two weeks

6667637 my perspective is that the bulk of our industry is organized around the demonstrable myth that we know what we want at the start and how to get it and therefore build our process assuming that we will take an optimal direct path to get there

6667652 brazil played a great match but we were able to improve and get stronger as the minutes went by
6667653 i told my players that they should believe in their own ability and in themselves that they should hold onto the ball in midfield and find the right tempo they did just that and here we are
6667654 we had one hell of a run i almost wish we had lost a game early on then this wouldnt hurt so much

6667657 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6667658 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6667659 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6667660 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6667663 this report from wisdom study is reassuring that there are real benefits for some women electing to use hrt
6667664 while it has been well established that quality of life measures are improved in younger symptomatic women this paper adds some information that even older women may benefit
6667665 while some of this information was reported from the whi which used the same hormonal regimen more sensitive instruments were used in wisdom which was able to show improvements in other measures such as sexual function
6667666 while this is important information and is reassuring regarding the benefits of hrt these findings in isolation are not an indication to initiate hormones in asymptomatic older women for the first time
6667667 it shows that hrt can offer real benefits to most women experiencing menopausal symptoms our advice remains the same each woman is an individual and she needs to discuss what s right for her with her doctor in the light of her medical history

6667676 sustained and planned attacks by extremist forces on the fruit laden trucks from kashmir
6667677 protesters supported by extremist and anti kashmir groups have been attacking our fruit laden trucks on the jammu srinagar national highway a kashmiri driver was killed and dozens were critically wounded
6667678 we have nearly 2 000 truckloads of apples ready this time and if not exported soon they will rot
6667679 if the economic blockade and atrocities on kashmiris are not immediately stopped we will go on fast unto death we are also planning to sit on a hunger strike on the srinagar muzaffaradad road
6667680 we are currently facing shortage of many life saving drugs as supply is disrupted due to protests at many places on the jammu srinagar national highway
6667681 around 750 trucks carrying essential commodities entered the valley wednesday night
6667682 we have a shortage of about 90 percent of life saving drugs in the valley because no medicines have come from jammu
6667683 we have not received any fresh supplies barring one truckload of generic drugs last week
6667684 right now the pharmacies are just about managing by supplying each other but even that can last for not more than a week
6667685 adequate quantity of life saving drugs for 750 indoor patients in the hospital
6667686 over thousands of patients who need the drugs at home
6667687 we are facing shortage of about 40 life saving drugs the important items of leading companies that are the fastest running brands are out of stock
6667688 we are medical representatives and we receive the medicines first we have not received any this month how is the government claiming stocks are adequate
6667689 a nutter will step out of the crowd with a big knife for him
6667690 jacqui smiths botched handling of the announcement triggered a farcical and embarrassing merry go round she should not have announced it until he got back

6667692 i just went up to phil at the end of the second set and said hey lets have fun
6667693 so phil went out and had fun and i became a great cheerleader just brought along the pom poms did a little cheer and let him do it
6667694 in our game we are always on trial and results tend to dictate that
6667695 we have been working hard on our culture development and leadership which we feel needed a little bit of improvement
6667696 the players have really responded to that to that end i genuinely believe that the pressure going into the season is on the other welsh regions
6667697 we have very little to prove weve won trophies have a lot of players involved in international rugby for our nation and were very proud of that and long may we continue to do that
6667698 going into the season were looking for consistency and a steady improvement
6667699 with the signings made and lack of silverware in the other regions then the pressure is completely on those this season
6667700 the money the region has spent shows ambition and it is now down to the players to perform on the field and take the step forward
6667701 a major factor is our strength in depth we have quality players in all positions whereas maybe in the past we did not and had to throw the youngsters in
6667702 hopefully this year we can pick and choose when to blood them
6667703 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6667704 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6667705 the russian georgia conflict has disrupted supplies and it looks like it will drag on and create a lot of uncertainty

6667707 parliament house is a work place the members of parliament should not be able to drink freely during working hours
6667708 having a bar serving alcohol during working hours is completely out of step with community expectations
6667709 it is completely unacceptable that members of parliament are able to sit in a bar in their workplace and drink when they should be working on behalf of the community
6667710 this is a major breakthrough for older patients who have a worn out failing aortic valve and too many other medical problems to make conventional surgery a good option
6667711 with this new technology we can offer more patients a better prognosis sparing them surgery and a months long recovery period which all huge benefits especially if youre in your 80s or 90s
6667712 im actually hoping to join a gym after all this is over

6667715 i want somebody whos independent somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have got a robust debate in the white house
6667716 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6667717 the fact that john mccain dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so called independent committee shows how desperate he is to change the subject from his shocking disconnect with the economic struggles of the american people
6667718 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
6667719 it is a big buy intended to go through the democratic convention
6667720 friendship with someone who doesnt like this country and is an unapologetic terrorist
6667721 he will gut you and show you your heart and smile at you he plays for keeps
6667722 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois
6667723 we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6667724 i said the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6667725 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6667726 they are trying to find dry land someplace to hide
6667727 were pulling in our plants and porch furniture making sure we have our supplies and gas for the generator
6667728 i still think we all need to stay on our toes
6667729 im ready to get back to work this is insane itll drive you nuts being stuck like this
6667730 the iraq issue has been kind of difficult for mccain to deal with
6667731 if the white house can work out some sort of agreement to demobilize in iraq that could make life a little easier for mccain because he has been forced over the last months to defend his hawkish position on iraq
6667732 that was really the only suspicious thing about the letter and our national headquarters advised out of an abundance of caution for our staff and volunteers that we have the authorities check it out
6667733 they dropped me off at my aunts house in pittsburgh

6667739 the day martin luther king spoke in washington i was a young man in the navy watching the speech on television with my grandparents
6667740 i said if i ever get an opportunity to experience history like this in my life i will take it and now im 70 and i never imagined something like this happening in my lifetime
6667741 i hear people say hey can you hook a brother up
6667742 i tell them ill do what i can but please dont ask for floor passes
6667743 her addiction to illicit drugs is the explanation for her involvement
6667744 one of her young children was a potential prosecution witness in this case
6667745 we have not been able to locate the mother we have exhausted all calls and leads that have come to us there have been in excess of 30
6667746 they all petered out to nothing the autopsy results are inconclusive and unless information comes forward to suggest who the mother is it will go through to an inquest
6667747 i thought she may have needed medical attention and i would be surprised if she had done so and a doctor had not bothered to tell anybody
6667748 a lot of our work is driven by and relies on assistance from the community if people are prepared to ring up and give us information to go on we follow it up
6667749 the investigation is ongoing and we appeal to anyone who may know who she is to contact crimestoppers
6667750 otherwise it will go to inquest but we need to discuss those issues with the coroner the direction the job is going to take and how they want to handle it as the coroner makes the finding
6667751 wearing traditional muslim dress has encouraged me its not an obstacle its quite the opposite
6667752 i feel very special to be in this situation and i dont feel any pressure by it
6667753 its great to finally have a high performance outfit that allows me to continue my need for modesty with a design made from fabric that allows freedom of movement and flexibility
6667754 i hope that wearing this type of sports top will inspire other women to see that modesty or religious beliefs dont have to be a barrier to participating in competitive sports
6667755 i feel very proud to have been selected it is a great honor and a dream come true for me
6667756 im proud to be representing my country at these olympics

6667759 all im responsible for is my actions and my words i know where my heart lies and i love my country and ive said this 1 000 times im just a basketball player
6667760 if floodgates begin to open then clearly it offends the overall principles and that i am certain we would look at

6667766 it was an immensely stupid thing to have done and i regret it enormously i have never used any drugs before or since
6667767 i was walking to meet a friend and was approached as is not uncommon in any city and offered cannabis
6667768 normally i would ignore this and walk straight on but for some reason i foolishly and impulsively decided to stop and buy some cannabis when i was offered something else i have no explanation but i decided to buy something else as well
6667769 i put them in my bag and immediately regretted this
6667770 i had no intention of using the ecstasy and why i didnt immediately throw this away i have asked myself so many times one does not expect to find oneself in this kind of situation
6667771 we have carefully considered the circumstances surrounding the caution and your actions thereafter
6667772 you are a young doctor at the start of your career from the beginning you have been open and honest about the caution and the circumstances surrounding it
6667773 you have admitted to using a small amount of cannabis at the festival
6667774 you have told the panel that you had not used any of the mdma ecstasy and had no intention of doing so
6667775 it was an isolated incident occurring over one year ago
6667776 the number of seizures of counterfeit vodka is increasing but unfortunately it only touches on what is coming in through the back door
6667777 consumers dont tell us about them because they think theyre on to a bargain but it is a lose lose situation and i would urge people not to touch it
6667778 this stuff can be made for pennies and the people behind it put more money into the labelling than what is inside
6667779 since the european union expanded to the east last year we have seen a lot more coming into our region because once bottles are within eu borders they can travel through unhindered
6667780 thousands of people have been killed by consumption of this in russia and the former soviet bloc
6667781 the counterfeiters are always trying to keep one step ahead of us but were fighting back working with our partners and improving intelligence and i believe its a battle we can win

6667847 its just like being at the race track you can do whatever you want and never get a ticket
6667848 cloud computing is one of those catch all buzz words that tries to encompass a variety of aspects ranging from deployment load balancing provisioning business model and architecture like web2
6667849 i view cloud computing as a broad array of web based services aimed at allowing users to obtain a wide range of functional capabilities on a pay as you go basis that previously required tremendous hardware software investments and professional skills to acquire cloud computing is the realization of the earlier ideals of utility computing without the technical complexities or complicated deployment worries
6667850 i think clouds are the next hype term for the next year or two people are coming to grips with virtualization and how it reshapes it creates service and software based models and in many ways changes a lot of the physical layer we are used to clouds will be the next transformation over the next several years building off of the software models that virtualization enabled

6667855 there were no injuries and the cause is still under investigation
6667856 the owner complained of having electrical problems in the past
6667857 were looking into that it appears maybe it started in the kitchen area thats where the breaker box was
6667858 i am very much discouraged by this situation in kashmir it really reflects the ultimate inability of the indian government to reconcile the people of kashmir to their connection with india
6667859 as happened then the pakistanis are very likely to fish in troubled waters even though god knows theyve got enough problems on their hands
6667860 for sure musharraf was devoted to this peace process he got it started in 2004 but before that you remember he was very much in the bad books of the indian government and the indian public
6667861 he was the kargil man his government was behind the attack on the indian parliament and so on and so forth so that we got to remember that there was a considerable reversal from the earlier moves at rapprochement with new delhi initiated by prime minister nawaz sharif whom musharraf deposed but not only did he get the peace process restarted but he also made proposals that were unprecedented for pakistan such as finding a solution outside the framework of the un resolutions
6667862 and so there will be a temptation as there already has been to play for the audience and that can only continue to have a bad reaction in india
6667863 but you never thought did you that india would be longing for the good old days with general musharraf
6667864 i dont see that as a way of even in the middle term developing its popularity but it may feel so and i think if it does it will be a major mistake
6667865 wants to keep things on an even keel and eventually to pursue the peace dialogue but the disturbances in kashmir will put pressure on that whole situation and will tempt those who dont want peace to meddle so i am worried
6667866 there are both similarities and differences with the 1990s one interesting difference is the role of the amarnath land issue and of the jammu hindu community
6667867 the amarnath land grant got a lot of people stirred up but when the new governor n n vohra resolved that it was people from jammu who expanded the protest so far more than the previous episodes this one has local roots
6667868 especially if the indian state however belatedly manages to demonstrate a degree of dexterity in defusing the crisis
6667869 it has already shown after one or two initial missteps that it is capable of showing restraint even in the face of grave provocation
6667870 it needs to keep doing more of the same despite pressures from within elements of the national security establishment to adopt a harder line
6667871 it also needs to douse the flames in jammu as they tend to generate their own fires in the valley
6667872 the wild card in all of this remains both the islamists and the hindu zealots who thrive on each other follies and short sighted goals and actions
6667873 there have been a lot of reasons that go back several weeks as to how this thing flared up
6667874 there are those who do want to reverse the peace process
6667875 and with the distracted political leadership in pakistan i believe that some of these forces are beginning to assert themselves again
6667876 it is something for the us and the international community to watch
6667877 i am very concerned and clearly it has the potential to unravel and the situation is far more worrisome than it was earlier because american intelligence has conclusive evidence that elements associated with the isi were involved in planning and perhaps even carrying out the bombing of the indian embassy in kabul
6667878 the current upsurge in violence and in agitation is the result of conditions within both jammu and the valley itself and the increased violence and the increased tension in the valley was largely the result of developments within the valley so i could believe that i am not going to point the finger at pakistan because of that

6667908 what i can do is do a courtesy exchange but it wont happen again cause there is not an issue with 3g
6667909 using the iphone on a network it is not designed for may break the iphone
6667910 oh no sir we inform all our customers before we sell them the 3g iphone
6667911 well no one informed me i wouldnt have bought one had i known but i guess thats the plan wouldnt sell as many phones if people knew the truth lying by omission is still lying
6667912 as much as the chip may be the chief problem glitches may also stem from apples software or the at amp t network part of the role of the infineon chip is to check whether theres enough 3g bandwidth available in a given area if 3g isnt available or there isnt enough bandwidth the iphone will be shifted to a slower network one source says apple programmed the infineon chip to demand a more powerful 3g signal than the iphone really requires so if too many people try to make a call or go on the internet in a given area some of the devices will decide theres insufficient power and switch to the slower network even if there is enough 3g bandwidth available according to this person the problems are only occurring in areas of high iphone density these include the san francisco bay area boston and certain overseas locales the reason the problem has gotten worse in recent days is because of the steep increase in iphone activations in these places the more people who are trying to use a given piece of gear the more likely they are to get bumped
6667913 im having the same problem and i live in the pocket area of sacramento i called att and they told me it was not the phone but the 3g network it would be interesting to have other 3g phones in the same exact area and see if they are also having the same problem if the other phones are having the problem then its the network 3g if not then it has to be the 3g i phone so lets see how long it will take this issue to be resolved so we may enjoy our i phones
6667914 i can happily report that ever since we have done the sim swap routine we now have three working iphone 3gs
6667915 any idea why my service wouldnt have 5 bars one mile from a tower
6667916 here is the bug here is the fix update the driver

6667921 the problem is affecting 2 to 3 of iphone traffic the people say that compares with a dropped call rate of around 1 for all traffic for at amp t
6667922 further to our telephone conversation on 20th august 2008 i can confirm that a case has been raised with apple with regards to the signal and service issues with their new 3g iphones apple have advised that they are presently working on a fix for this issue and hope to have resolved with the latest software updates
6667923 look we know there is a global problem going on were working on it
6667924 what i didnt hear you iphone iphone are you there
6667925 safari cant open the page because it could not connect to the server

6667927 bars are not an indication of how strong the signal is
6667928 just arent a good indicator of where your signal strength is
6667929 yeah theres a chance that some of the first batch could have some reception issues just like any product

6668066 listen the performance lately has been a little rougher than anyone would like to go through
6668067 but we didnt make any bones about what we were going to do when we said we were going to go through a rebuilding
6668068 for people who watch the team on a day to day basis that might seem like a long way away but our goal first and foremost was to rebuild our system and we have done that im very pleased by that very pleased when i see the young players we have in our system to go from where we were this time last year to where we are now is amazing
6668069 ive seen all of their minor league guys and believe me when i say this billy did a good thing
6668070 of all the organizations ive seen they have the best talent ive seen this year he has a plan
6668071 given the direction were going we thought it was the proper move at the time long term well benefit from it with the players we got
6668072 part of it is that we played so well before the break it seems like rebuilding happens overnight and it doesnt
6668073 last year we were in third place our payroll was growing beyond our means and we had no farm system now were in third place but have the system we wanted and our payroll has been reduced to the point that we have more flexibility to do some other things
6668074 who was the fool that said sachin faced harder opponents ur a not only has technology and research improve bowling but it has also improved batting making it still an even level at which everyone competes cricket was at a very elite stage in the 30s 40s hence the invincibles in which bradman even stould out from them and captained them im sick of noobs talking about sachins odi which is non comparable as they didnt have odi back when the bradman played and even then in tests his strike rate was still incredibly high bradman was miles ahead of his fellow players and still is today if you look at sachin he is definately not miles infront if at all of his fellow players in fact i could easliy compare sir viv richards or ponting to tendulkar which is definately debatable conclusion sachin is a great player and was always great to watch but there is too many facts that imply that bradman was the great ever batsman
6668075 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6668076 so far everything that has been received demonstrates we have no problem for the eligibility of the competitors
6668077 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6668078 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6668079 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6668080 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6668081 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6668082 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6668083 it really rallied too much previously so we really expected a correction this week
6668084 they just finished the first semester second quarter reports and there were good performers and not so good performers and they were all saying they would be experiencing the same difficulties
6668085 we are just waiting for good news there is no big deal coming out
6668086 i used to be able to pop out the backside of the company go to the train tracks and throw the metal parts on the tracks and watch them get crushed my dad would actually come up with me we had this wonderful collection of destroyed scrap metal it was a strange hobby
6668087 but you learn from your father when youve got a crazy father you become a crazy person
6668088 you cant modify the human body beyond its anthropological form the us government has a restriction on that you cant have gills or cant add a third arm on your back
6668089 i remember being a seven year old when i was dragged in to see star wars and my brother educated me in why certain things were cool and some things didnt need to be explained flash forward and through no direct pathway i ended up being in the film industry for a while and still dabble in it i look back at those older films and how they affect a large section of the population i remember seeing some of the making ofs thats when it breaks down the mystic of it all you see behind the scenes and the people that see that are going to blaze the trail for the future
6668090 i was 10 or 11 years old and my folks got me a back tour of the epcot center it showed them building attractions and rides and how they used foam for this and fiberglass for that they had drawings up on the walls and they had model shops and welders you got to see even topiaries started from a sketch that went into a prototype that went into a wireframe that went to a nursery where they started growing vines and it took five or six years for it to reach the tip if the nose of the elephant seeing that whole flow was so important
6668091 i think some of the shapes that inspired me early on some of the forms i witnessed and perhaps sunk in subconsciously i reflect some of those shapes i like to play with in interior and exterior shapes have to do with creasing form manipulation all those things
6668092 i think thats why architects sometimes have very intelligent heady or sometimes egotistical thoughts because they are kind of like this god figure and are literally sculpting a world on a bigger scale lets say you designed cutlery they are doing something more finite more intimate and the personalities change based on what kind of design work you do
6668093 i go and get a sense of how the human body and perception reacts to different volumes whether it feels cave like or feels like a precipice you want to go to the tip of there is always that question do you want to go in the valley or hopscotch from the top of things
6668094 its one thing i think the movie industry has over other industries that are lumbering and lacking the speed and agility to change direction a few degrees in order to better themselves i think the movie industry is great that way dissolving every time a movie is made a production is a corporation that rematerializes every nine to 14 months and that shakes out people that arent supposed to be there shakes up processes that dont work well and its a fast evolution its why i think its such a good model
6668095 who does a lot of the same process that filming does you have a market young old whatever whats the mood the flavor the materials you build a trend you come up with a design they have to be familiar with the target age group they have the problem a lot of industries do they lumber they cant adjust properly look at them now they are dying i think movies can fall into the same trap look at how many crap movies are made in a row they seem to forget there is a story behind it all you see a film that looks like such crap because they did all the technique all the departments were running smoothly but they just let the inception of it fade
6668096 working on minority report was fortunate because the production designer and i saw eye to eye with technology alex mcdowell is a very intelligent thoughtful visualist he could see from my portfolio from things i did for bmw that it was advanced concept automotive that hand gesture recognition and eye tracking and all these technologies could parlay right over into the movie he could see i was focused on not just making a pretty image but the pragmatic behind it
6668097 i think the gaming industry will evolve with the people that started with it i was part of the side scrolling gaming and i never got into first person shooters i still love games like ms pacman they are hilarious to me and that is truly entertaining but if i get stressed out over having 365 buttons that i somehow have to get my 10 fingers around and theres people shooting at me and screaming well i get enough of that at work i just dont want to go into a hypothetical space where ive got 3000 bosses trying to shoot me i tried one online gaming where a friend suggested i just sit in and i got tense and wondered ok how do you get into this

6668107 the only thing that is uncertain is the amount of rain
6668108 its almost certain we will receive some degree of flooding
6668109 everythings really dry right now and weve got a lot of capacity to absorb rain were watching very carefully but we cant say for sure right now that its going to be terrible and we cant say for sure that it will be mild

6668116 e gli appunti per lottavo in realt nella chiacchierata vidal fa riferimento anche alla situazione politica americana odierna alle imminenti presidenziali ed esprime il suo pensiero su entrambi i candidati un punto di vista il suo molto interessante vi consiglio di leggerlo attentamente giusto un paio di sottolineature tratte dallincontro che riguardano pi da vicino il mestiere di scrittore stato il primo tentativo di vidal di scrivere un romanzo esplicitamente politico uno dei personaggi ricorda il senatore cieco un altro al quale vidal sembra fosse affezionato mentre altri sono pura invenzione senza ancora saperlo aveva tracciato le fondamenta della serie dei sette romanzi storici ora raccolti sotto il titolo di narratives of empire un ottavo volume ancora in forma di appunti ho imparato a scrivere romanzi storici da come le lunghe e ramificate saghe di scott i romanzi storici di vidal si possono a buon diritto definire abili prende una storia per mano e la porta con sicurezza fino al traguardo creando una ricca atmosfera lungo il percorso non ha molta importanza che alcuni dei personaggi di burr e lincoln bompiani siano abbastanza simili agli aristocratici romani di giuliano lo scopo dei romanzi storici di vidal era smascherare i dannati storici ero convinto che gli accademici distorcessero la storia e io volevo scrivere con la maggior precisione possibile quel che le figure storiche avevano effettivamente fatto e detto non pensi che non tragga beneficio dagli orrori delle nostre scuole pubbliche la storia americana insegnata molto male
6668117 vidal a differenza della maggior parte dei suoi colleghi continua a rimetter mano alle sue opere in occasione di nuove edizioni non c quasi pagina della ad esempio in cui dialogo e descrizioni non siano stati riscritti la storia parla di una relazione relativamente innocente tra due compagni di scuola dello stesso sesso jim e bob che ricorda alla lontana la relazione tra vidal e il suo amico jimmie trimble caduto nella seconda guerra mondiale alla fine dell edizione originale del romanzo i due amici si incontrano di nuovo dopo molti anni jim fa un avance a bob e quando viene rifiutato con l accusa di essere un finocchio lo uccide nell edizione riveduta pubblicata nel 1965 in luogo dell assassinio c uno stupro e bob lasciato in lacrime

6668126 een uur later stegen we wel op ik hoorde een verschrikkelijke herrie en het volgende moment werd ik uit het vliegtuig geslingerd ik moet bewusteloos zijn geraakt en kwam weer bij positieven door een enorme explosie ik voelde een ongelofelijke hitte en hoorde mensen en kinderen om hulp roepen ik kon me nauwelijks bewegen richtte mijn hoofd iets op en zag de lichamen om me heen
6668127 het viel me op dat er iets mis was met het vliegtuig
6668128 toen ik omhoog keek zag ik dat het dak van het toestel verdwenen was

6668142 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6668143 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women
6668144 on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6668145 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
6668146 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments is not uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it we were surprised to learn that we had found a new virus
6668147 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are many years away

6668149 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6668150 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6668151 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6668152 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6668153 its great that we have wireless email and wireless internet and stuff like that but at the end of the day it would be nice to have wireless recharge as well

6668174 fancy drop down menus and fast moving flash graphics are great for catching the users eye but when you want to get down to business make sure your site presents an easy navigation menu and map this will allow most national media marketing users to get what they are after and at the same time be wowed by your graphical presentations
6668175 and the old adage you have to spend money to make money applies dont go cheap on your websites checkout process or navigational menus instead save money by using simple content generation software and ready made blog software these steps will ensure quality at the right price
6668176 the thank you page can also remind the customer of other merchandise service offers on your website which might create another sales opportunity remember not to go overboard just give them 3 or 4 other offers or coupons or else they may get confused and not ever return again
6668177 be 100 certain that your shopping cart and check out process are super easy to use
6668178 or else confused customers will simply bail out and not complete their purchase
6668179 dont forget that national media marketing affiliate programs are a great way to drive customers towards your site
6668180 you may have to pay up to 25 for an affiliate lead but in the long run youre making a hell of a lot more money than you would without affiliate traffic youll find that the top 20 of your affiliates count for nearly 80 of all your income so be sure to take care of your business partners
6668181 it takes a discplined and creative approach to get your message across
6668182 and some times a little luck and good old fashioned word of mouth advertising

6668200 we need to factor in that the government will spend a lot of money trying to buy over voters and its a three way fight which is always a spoiler

6668271 that some immigrant children require special help with language issues in the early stages of schooling
6668272 our past experience with streaming and remedial classes is that this approach causes as many problems as it solves once a child has accepted that he is in the out group then its much more difficult to integrate fully later
6668273 in practice language is learned from classmates in school rooms and in the playground total immersion is the best way to learn a language as an adult and id guess that its the same with children taking children out of an english speaking environment and putting them in a class where the only fluent english speaker is the teacher does not seem to be the most sensible way to learn english
6668274 always amazed at the language abilities of the teenage children on the site in athlone
6668275 a typical young teenager will speak two languages fluently and have a good working knowledge of at least three more i doubt that there are many children from the mainstream community who can match that
6668276 id worry that immigrant children will be used as scapegoats for the general lack of resources in the educational sector unless the resources problems are solved then short term ideas like this have the potential to do serious harm to both immigrant and mainstream children

6668338 dicen que soy introvertido porque no concedo muchas entrevistas la realidad es que no concedo muchas entrevistas porque no hago muchas pel culas
6668339 probablemente si he dirigido pocas pel culas ha sido por una combinaci n de cosas lo m s relevante es que estuve arruinado y con una hija a la que educar tuve que ser precavido
6668340 no me pod a poner a hacer pel culas esot ricas as de sencillo
6668341 soy el padre de todo este mundo nuestro que se mueve alrededor de la guerra de las galaxias incluida la pel cula de dibujos animados que ahora vamos a estrenar clones war en las salas el 29 de agosto y voy a realizar una serie de televisi n con personajes de carne y hueso en eso trabajo ahora pongo en marcha el proceso ense o a la gente lo que tiene que hacer y marco unas pautas como un padre luego llega el equipo comercial que desarrolla los juegos los juguetes y todo eso o sea el hijo que suele hacer lo que le da la gana de vez en cuando preguntan oye podemos matar a yoda qu poca formalidad
6668342 de bloggers y seguidores ellos son el esp ritu santo y tienen su propio mundo yo soy el padre y voy a lo m o y
6668343 al principio yo quer a ser ilustrador luego quise ir a una escuela de bellas artes de los angeles mi padre me dijo que ni hablar que los artistas no ganan dinero como sab a que yo era un vago que no terminaba nunca lo que empezaba sospechaba que no me tomar a en serio la carrera hoy estoy convencido de que al final si hubiera ido a la escuela de arte y hubiera empezado a trabajar como ilustrador probablemente habr a derivado hacia los dibujos animados y habr a terminado en la guerra de los clones
6668344 que fue la carrera que empec habr a hecho documentales y habr a terminado haciendo pel culas como las que he hecho si juntan lo que m s me gusta el arte la antropolog a y el cine les salen mis pel culas
6668345 no estoy muy puesto en todas esas teor as psicol gicas
6668346 pero s claro como ocurre con todo escritor las ideas vienen de la experiencia y no de un lugar m gico
6668347 es algo aparte de las pel culas de en las guerras de los clones aparecen todos los personajes que todo el mundo conoce desde yoda hasta anakin pasando por mace windu y obi wan ah est n todos en la serie con personajes reales por el contrario no hay nadie conocido porque la acci n ocurre despu s del episodio iii todo el mundo ya ha muerto o anda escondido por ah se oyen referencias al emperador exactamente igual que en el episodio iv pero en trata de personajes diferentes digamos que hay un mill n de historias en cada gran ciudad y que esta vez vamos a contar otra
6668348 esper bamos unas cifras en taquilla del orden de las que se han registrado
6668349 que es teniendo en cuenta la inflaci n lo que hicieron las otras en otras palabras no hemos salido mal para la proeza que fue armar la historia y conseguir embarcar en ella a todo el mundo esta vez el rodaje estaba lleno de gente que dec a yo esto lo quiero as yo lo quiero as mientras cuando empezamos con indiana yo me limitaba a decir esto lo vamos a hacer as qu f cil era pero es que hay que dar gusto a todo el mundo porque todo el mundo es importante y tiene xito qu se le va a hacer
6668350 si soy capaz de ofrecerles otra idea que les guste a todos haremos otra entrega sobre todo a spielberg que en principio no estaba muy entusiasmado con retomar a indiana ahora sin embargo lo veo m s dispuesto aunque a n tenemos pendientes de decidir algunas cuestiones steven quiere indagar en el pasado de indiana yo prefiero llevarlo a un lugar diferente veremos a ver si somos capaces de sacar adelante otra vez esta historia

6668363 although israeli military intelligence experts believe that syrian military strategy is defensive and retaliatory they nevertheless wonder if and when damascus will shift to an offensive footing could there come a time when syrian president bashar al assad would feel that syrias defences are solid enough and its forces strong enough to mount an offensive against israel might he decide to capitalise on the us quagmire in iraq the shaky position of the current administration at home and the aversion in the us to a new military adventure in the region as well as on the weakness of the present government in israel at a time when the israeli military is still licking its wounds from the setback in lebanon in 2006 and the onslaught of short range missile fire from hizbullah during that engagement
6668364 israels foremost security dilemma which was cast into relief during its last war against lebanon is its vulnerability to missile bombardment the israeli antiballistic defence system at the time a combination of hawk patriot and arrow missiles proved incapable of intercepting any of the 3 000 missiles that soared into israel in july and august 2006 nor did israeli aerial bombardment succeed in making a dent in hizbullahs missile delivery capacities for which reason the lebanese resistance movement was able to sustain an ongoing missile barrage throughout the war

6668367 mosport is a very difficult track it is fast and definitely takes some time to learn its a lot of fun to drive but its tough to be confident here because of the high speed turns many of which are fifth and fourth gear turns and the complexity im really looking forward to the race the pressure is on its a critical point in the championship for all of the drivers and teams and you should see some exciting racing this weekend
6668368 were back to our standard 2 hour and 45 minute event it should be a two stop race if all goes as planned for as fast and challenging as mosport is we usually see few cautions here but at our last race at road america there were more cautions than wed ever seen at that track hopefully this is not a trend i expect sundays race to be a tough one everyone is pushing hard for the championship and with high level of competition in the prototype classes managing traffic is going to be an issue in gt2 ferrari showed tremendous pace at road america we definitely have our work cut out for us this weekend

6668390 the lions share of battle is won when you limit the amount of time your children spend online when they eat dinner with you have family home evening and family prayer with you and are close to you emotionally
6668391 but if your kid is online playing warcraft 16 hours a day that emotional and spiritual separation creates a greater level of risk

6668427 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke

6668432 and i think its the games for nintendo i think whatever price theyre at i think its the games that have really really driven it
6668433 we started off at the beginning of the year with gt5 prologue then we went to gta iv then metal gear solid therell be littlebigplanet and then we move onto pes and fifa and all those
6668434 were on rails and i think that those games are going to drive it
6668435 when you do focus groups with people whether its in the uk or not its amazing that not necessarily children but an 11 or 12 year old boy has in his mind that he wants a ps3 because of this game or because of this particular feature
6668436 he doesnt really think of the price because he doesnt really have any perception of it but hell say to his parents i want a ps3
6668437 if he wants a new bike and he gets an old back hes not going to be very happy children dont think about the price so much the press think about the price its got to come down
6668438 we have not announced a price drop but we have got an 80gb sku instead of a 40gb sku now thats interesting and theres going to be twice as many games and there is a 160gb sku with 70 euros of downloadable content
6668439 so we think that were keeping that value there the former boss of sony computer entertainment was terry tokunaka and hed answer the question of will there be a price cut with im not saying in the long term future were not going to drop the price
6668440 what im saying is that were not going to drop the price this year

6668493 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

6668591 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6668592 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6668593 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6668594 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6668595 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6668596 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6668597 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6668598 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6668599 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6668600 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6668601 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6668602 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6668603 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6668604 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6668605 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6668606 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6668607 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6668608 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6668609 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6668610 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6668611 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6668612 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6668613 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6668614 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6668615 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6668616 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6668617 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6668618 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6668619 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6668620 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6668621 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6668622 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6668623 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6668624 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6668625 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6668626 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6668627 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6668628 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6668629 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6668630 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6668631 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6668632 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6668633 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6668634 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6668635 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6668636 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6668637 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6668638 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6668639 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6668640 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6668641 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6668642 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6668643 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6668644 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6668645 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6668646 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6668647 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6668648 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6668649 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6668650 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6668651 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6668652 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6668653 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6668654 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6668655 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6668656 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6668657 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6668658 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6668659 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6668660 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6668661 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6668662 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6668663 who are open to doing something on the production side
6668664 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6668665 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6668666 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6668667 no seas pendeja el poder de los hombres que dicen esa clase de barbaridades est en que saben que a las mujeres no les gusta ser tratadas as
6668668 el asunto es que ellos est n esperando molestia o verg enza en las mujeres pero no est n esperando agradecimiento y una sonrisa
6668669 uy negrita usted es la mujer mas bonita que he visto desde que llegu a costa rica

6668675 de omzet heeft zich ontwikkeld zoals eerder dit jaar in onze trading update geschetst dat geldt ook voor de marktomstandigheden
6668676 de laatste dagen wordt private equity behoorlijk in het verdomhoekje gezet men bekijkt bedrijven waarin wij beleggen als beursfondsen en dat is een andere categorie die gebonden is aan specifieke regels wat betreft vermogensverhoudingen
6668677 wij investeren waar anders niets zou gebeuren omdat de banken het risico niet aandurven onze inzet is de omzet te verhogen en daarmee de waarde van het bedrijf winstgevendheid een belangrijk item voor aandeelhouders op de beurs speelt in de private equity wereld minder je wilt een bedrijf groter en sterker maken om het na gemiddeld vijf jaar door te verkopen
6668678 daar kan ik ook zo een optelsom van honderden miljoenen maken dat is nou eenmaal de wet en hele legers belastingadviseurs staan bedrijven bij om zo min mogelijk kwijt te zijn aan de fiscus dat is volkomen legaal die mensen worden niet gearresteerd of zo alleen als een private equity bedrijf gebruik maakt van de geldende belastingregels wordt meteen moord en brand geschreeuwd
6668679 ik neem aan dat bos kort na de zomer met die notitie komt
6668680 investeringsfirmas hebben geen enkel belang bij een faillissement en ook niet bij minder service dat is juist de kurk waarop een bedrijf moet drijven en groeien
6668681 the incident occurred near the griffin hotel and as a result a 21 year old ebbw vale man was pronounced dead at the scene
6668682 i reckon we should hold a referendum in the valley
6668683 to seek shareholder approval to purchase its own shares and thereafter to commence a share repurchase program
6668684 we believe that camecs shares are currently significantly undervalued we intend to enter the market to repurchase shares and will continue to do so until we believe that the shares are more appropriately valued
6668685 hurry grab your clothes and jump out the window my husband is home early
6668686 i cant jump out the window its raining like hell out there
6668687 if my husband catches us in here he will kill both of us
6668688 oh yes it feels so free having the air blow over your skin while you are running
6668689 do you always run carrying your clothes on your arm
6668690 oh yes that way i can get dressed at the end of the run and get in my car to go home
6668691 take doing a idolater in contemplation of rhapsode a great circle touching at lowly second team years aftermost hope charge jaws of death save birth whichever is futuristic above grouping a acquittance germaneness after the fairness involvement position
6668692 the depth versus which a seeker has wonted burden replacing his bend sinister him unfit see and well constructed revulsion in passage to victims are strong considerations
6668693 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
6668694 the partnership connects leading researchers and research laboratories in nanocomposites biopolymers and polymer processing and allows us to share equipment and expertise
6668695 there are a number of collaborative research projects underway such as a joint project on nanostructured drug delivery materials
6668696 uq phd graduate dr kayleen campbell worked on these materials at qub now back at uq we are assessing the important biological interactions of these nanomaterials
6668697 once student enrollment settles often this is not until a week or two into the school year i will examine our needs as a total school facility and make decisions regarding how the mobile units can best accommodate these needs
6668698 if we get the answers from them aqua well work with them 100 percent if not well look for other channels
6668699 it doesnt really matter who gets in the new president is in for a very hard time it doesnt take too many more hundreds of billions in bailouts to be more than the taxpayers can handle
6668700 private industry is where the innovations need to come from
6668701 obama is a great talker but can he lead congress into the right moves to salvage the economy
6668702 no matter who wins the november election the economy will not improve overnight
6668703 we must find a way for the national government as well as state and local government to cut out the wasteful spending bring jobs back to america and find alternative energy sources
6668704 i do not like the war stance of mccain but have economic issues with more government programs and other democrat obama economics
6668705 more government in our lives and erode freedoms plus we know what happens to programs run by the government
6668706 it appears that the past eight years have resulted in one of the worst economies in decades the highest deficit severely damaged international reputation and the lowest support for womens rights since the 1970s
6668707 a positive but short lived effect on our countrys economy
6668708 i have been a grocery shopper for 50 years and i am dismayed at how much prices are rising
6668709 something must be done and soon and i am not sure a new president is the answer i keep listening to mccain and obamas plans to help our economy but wonder just how much they can do
6668710 the meeting was an effort to get feedback from neighbors
6668711 it was an effort to get input on our plan in a collaborative manner
6668712 it is important that we try to address the concerns of our neighbors the community and the town of summerfield the meeting on the 31st was the first step in that process
6668713 just how many grocery stores do we need in this area anyway
6668714 we already have a walgreens going up 100 yards from a cvs with a food lion behind it i thought this was summerfield not wendover avenue
6668715 if it were flat i would be much less concerned but that septic field slopes downward and could seep into the water systems it just doesnt stand to reason that that would work
6668716 the developer said they did a traffic study and this development wouldnt impact traffic by more than about two seconds
6668717 we are clearly taking those comments seriously thats really the stage were in now with the planning process
6668718 i understand peoples concerns about the negatives and redundancies associated with the proposed harris teeter in summerfield
6668719 summerfield was incorporated to provide protection from annexation by the city of greensboro and incursion of high density development
6668720 why in the world would we want this mess in summerfield
6668721 remember that the citizens of summerfield have the right under north carolina general statute 160 a 385 and 386 to file a protest petition to the summerfield city council
6668722 here we go again a group of big money investors trying to make summerfield more than just a nice place to raise a family
6668723 i think this development is a wonderful opportunity for the town
6668724 commercial development should include the highest density high impact uses at the major node intersections while lower density low impact uses should be located at the minor nodes and town core areas
6668725 due to its physical constraints it is unlikely that study areas would support large scale industrial or retail development
6668726 please be advised that this property is in fact not located at an intersection
6668727 hmm good ideas summerfield will just keep being known as a bedroom community and we all can benefit from those higher gas prices on those commute times to work in greensboro and we all know what a high water mark food lion is
6668728 why dont we just call this the lake brandt 400 raceway i can see it now bumber to bumper into turn 3
6668729 the trigger kicks in if medicares trustees project for two years in a row that the program will draw more than 45 of its funding from general government revenue instead of from payroll taxes or premiums and co pays from beneficiaries this has happened for the last two years and probably will happen every year for the foreseeable future and when it does the white house is required to write up corrective legislation
6668730 im not saying bad liverpool teams ever won the league of course they didnt but maybe a few years ago you could afford to carry a few players
6668731 i dont think thats possible now every position has got to be filled by a top player if you want to win things on a consistent basis
6668732 the fact that the manager hasnt bought in loads of new players shows he has faith in the squad it hasnt changed much at all from last season
6668733 the year before last we finished with 68 points and last year we got 83 which represents a big step up we can all learn from the mistakes we made last year and hopefully go one step better this time
6668734 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good maybe this will be the season for anelka
6668735 i need to work more on his head on his thinking in the field because he has good quality
6668736 we speak about it quite often neither of us started well and we used to say we wanted to leave
6668737 we can laugh about it now because we have both reached 100 games
6668738 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6668739 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him
6668740 many students saw the victim fleeing the scene bleeding from wounds
6668741 well ask for help from experts for their post trauma treatment
6668742 this is a major breakthrough for older patients who have a worn out failing aortic valve and too many other medical problems to make conventional surgery a good option
6668743 with this new technology we can offer more patients a better prognosis sparing them surgery and a months long recovery period which all huge benefits especially if youre in your 80s or 90s
6668744 im actually hoping to join a gym after all this is over
6668745 we have not been able to locate the mother we have exhausted all calls and leads that have come to us there have been in excess of 30
6668746 they all petered out to nothing the autopsy results are inconclusive and unless information comes forward to suggest who the mother is it will go through to an inquest
6668747 i thought she may have needed medical attention and i would be surprised if she had done so and a doctor had not bothered to tell anybody
6668748 a lot of our work is driven by and relies on assistance from the community if people are prepared to ring up and give us information to go on we follow it up
6668749 the investigation is ongoing and we appeal to anyone who may know who she is to contact crimestoppers
6668750 otherwise it will go to inquest but we need to discuss those issues with the coroner the direction the job is going to take and how they want to handle it as the coroner makes the finding
6668751 not designed to punish the prisoner but to protect the community
6668752 we make no apologies for our sex offender legislation which is the toughest in australia and we will continue to review our laws to ensure offenders released into the community by the court are properly supervised
6668753 our main priority is the protection of the community by reducing the risk of these people re offending
6668754 effici nt bestuur en fiscale verantwoordelijkheid gaan hand in hand op dit ogenblik kan de federale staat het niet meer trekken terwijl er langs vlaamse kant geld zat is en langs franstalige kant geld op een onverantwoorde manier wordt uitgegeven een fundamentele staatshervorming kan niet wachten
6668755 thats not the way we perceive being a champion i have no problem with him doing a show i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100m
6668756 i understand the joy he might have interpreted it in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6668757 he must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s
6668758 he still has to mature he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that
6668759 i guess theres mixed feelings among athletes to me i dont feel like hes being disrespectful if this guy has worked his tail off every day on his knees throwing up like i was in practice he deserves to dance
6668760 a lot of people are hoping i will go to the 400m but dont hold your breath
6668761 anything is possible but im not worried about the 400m world record yet
6668762 we are not alone the county has had some projects along with the federal government
6668763 the private sector is working off the investment governments have made
6668764 well have agreement when we have agreement so all of those stories in the newspapers about what the agreement says probably ought to be disregarded until we have an agreement
6668765 the president and every american wants to see american troops come home but not until the job is done and there is more security more political progress and more economic progress inside iraq
6668766 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe can be done whats feasible
6668767 today condoleezza rice the occupation foreign secretary arrived in iraq to try to put pressure on the government of iraq to accept terms dictated by the occupation to sign this ominous treaty
6668768 it is encouraging to know so many people are looking for stuart and offering us their support
6668769 stuart our daughter is improving on a daily basis and is no longer in royal aberdeen childrens hospital if you read this stuart please get in touch your family miss you
6668770 the response from the public has been good and a number of reported sightings are being investigated
6668771 i qualified last september but it hasnt really hit me until now
6668772 with the start of the olympics you realise just how big and important it all is and how lucky you are because not many get to go out and represent their country its a real honour and an amazing experience i want to go out there and score goals
6668773 i felt very sorry for myself and tried to work for the next couple of years but it was getting harder
6668774 i bumbled through and started teaching again it was then i met my future wife joanna through coaching netball
6668775 i did recover after intensive dialysis treatment and i convalesced for seven months having to learn to walk again
6668776 eventually i went back to work but i struggled to gain constant employment in the end i felt this was not practical for me in my position due to the limitations of my eye condition
6668777 the charges relate to the repeated sexual assault of a former altar boy on the states south coast
6668778 police will allege the offences occurred over a period from 1969 to 1976 commencing when the victim was 10 years old
6668779 when i watch a sports meet i often think of course praise is due to the victors but it is those competitors who press on to the finish line despite having fallen behind and the spectators who do not laugh at them who are the future backbone of china
6668780 whos going to be the idiot who flunks out of college
6668781 i set goals for myself and i succeeded beyond my wildest dreams
6668782 then i asked myself what would i like to do now
6668783 he has a great eye and i think he helped us both with our old resources as well as our new ones he was able to look at the big picture as well as the fine details
6668784 he was good at bringing a consensus together for tough issues
6668785 i dont know if anybody else will be able to do as good a job as he did
6668786 it all started when i was in college at architecture school and my parents called me up and told me they wanted to live in an old courthouse from 1834
6668787 i started working with the builders and soon i was hooked
6668788 thats certainly progress but if you think about it its still just a fraction of the university community
6668789 were just trying to get the message in as many hands as possible
6668790 but we still have a lot of work to do and we realize that
6668791 whenever i hear about it i cant do it at that time
6668792 if somebody hands me something i usually read it and throw it away but at least i read it
6668793 we certainly recognize that students hearing that message from other students theyre more likely to pay attention to that than getting an e mail
6668794 but its a nice safety net to have in case something happens
6668795 i think its a wonderful way to honor eve and her leadership at carolina
6668796 i think its an excellent way to honor student leadership that emerges while students are at carolina as opposed to students who were leaders in high school and awarded a scholarship on entering carolina
6668797 we have the funds to fully fund one and the sustainability to fund more scholarships
6668798 i hope the recipient of the eve marie carson scholarship receives the opportunity to have the most meaningful dynamic and active senior year as possible
6668799 we want to focus on the one to two things that this university can do to make it better tomorrow than it is today
6668800 weve pretty much left it to them to set their own process
6668801 we just want them to report in every now and then
6668802 knowing whats going to happen in coming years with tuition is dependant on where we are and where we are going
6668803 when you talk to the people in the know you get the known answer
6668804 but when you ask those people not in the know you can be surprised
6668805 my dare my love was all in jest conceal from these your lovely form come to the fire ill keep you warm
6668806 oh let us see if lust gives way to chivalry
6668807 dare to touch my lovely lass and you will lie beneath the grass

6668823 tahun 2007 lalu ada 123 ribu pelanggan yang melakukan pencurian listrik yang kita sudah tindak lanjuti ada yang masuk pengadilan dan ada yang cukup kita seelsaikan dengan cara mereka melakukan pembayaran tagihan susulan
6668824 bila omset pln yang sudah rp 80 triliun tagihan susulan yang hanya rp 350 miliar itu memang termasuk kecil dibandingkan omset pln
6668825 it says i am missing a file for crowded could someone upload the files somewere or send me the one i need
6668826 the hatred acts of persecution and displays of anti semitism directed against the jews by christians at any time and in any place
6668827 but gojdic said that it is the duty of the priest to help those persecuted avoid tranports and that this stems from the commandment to love your neighbor

6668830 rajendran is the through line the narrative arc in this piece and will serve for transitions
6668831 although youre seeing six plays written by six different artists it is going to feel like one fluid show
6668832 the collective works to fine tune theatrical productions so they can be sent out to film festivals and other contests
6668833 it provides audiences with a sense of community and a sense of agency
6668834 it is an opportunity for people to come together and be brought closer together in celebration of carrboro and local artists
6668835 you get good music and good folks to be around
6668836 carrboro has a pretty old linked musical tradition thats still going
6668837 to regulars it really is a big part of what carrboro is about
6668838 i do think we give something important back to the community and i think people really appreciate it
6668839 um there are over 18 editors gt in the game
6668840 das war mir peinlich als ich von der geschichte geh rt habe
6668841 ich glaube dass mccain ein besserer oberbefehlshaber der streitkr fte sein wird als obama der ja auch gegen die homo ehe ist
6668842 jetzt ist es wichtig einen erfahrenen lteren mann zu haben der unser land in dieser gef hrlichen zeit verteidigt sp ter k nnen wir ber homo themen reden
6668843 you shouldnt need to spend 300 million to tell people your 2 year old product isnt trash
6668844 it is vital for people to recognize the symptoms of stroke and promptly call emergency medical services at 911 when they occur
6668845 unc students have got the sfac because it allows them to have some control as to what they are paying and what money goes where
6668846 its a great way to take an in depth look as to whether student money is used wisely and efficiently
6668847 we began to look at a few fees especially in student government
6668848 but that sort of got placed under the radar im sure that the committee this year will focus a lot on that
6668849 we are actively pursuing it but it needs to be a joint decision
6668850 the no 1 reason is that an internet provider would create a more seamless transition between student and alumni e mail addresses
6668851 students would be able to keep their same campus e mail addresses but the experience would look and feel like gmail
6668852 we are looking at legal and technical issues surrounding outsourcing right now and looking at how other universities are going about it
6668853 the bottom line is we do better business on that night
6668854 restaurants and bars do see a much larger crowd on halloween days and evenings

6668859 we have been holding that view for the last 7 8 months especially when the realty space was performing very well like in november december last year we were saying utilise every rise to exit the property stocks because at the ground level we were finding a situation which was totally different than what we are seeing in the stock market as far as the property stocks are concerned like even now we are still holding the same view we still feel that the property prices will seek lower levels sometime around november december by which time most of these stocks which we are seeing a decent bounce back in the last couple of weeks in fact seeking much lower levels a stock like dlf we still hold our view that we could see levels of closer to around rs 310 320
6668860 i have been suggesting buying banking from an investment point of view i am not buying banking from a trading point of view from a trading point of view possibly there could be some more downside from here but as an investor i dont think i can catch the bottom so at these levels most of the banking stocks quite attractive and with a view that possibly we may not have an interest rate hike like i said earlier in october what the market is expecting because of which most of them are dumping the banking stocks so when most of the people are dumping banking stocks as a contrarian i would prefer to buy at these levels with a clear view that possibly i could see 5 or 8 lower than these levels and even at those levels possibly i will like average out
6668861 at cmp of rs 211 the stocks trades at 10 9x its ttm eps of rs 18 35 and 8 3x its fy09e eps of rs 24 01 we recommend a buy on the stock with a price target of rs 315 which would discount its fy09e eps of rs 24 01 by 13 1x

6668866 locally grown helps us promote downtown and gives people the chance to enjoy our businesses and everything the town has to offer
6668867 any time you close the streets the impact on merchants traffic and parking starts to become a negative one
6668868 it was wonderful to see all that vitality and energy downtown
6668869 it was an intersection of a lot of different kinds of people that really defined what makes our community special
6668870 its not really clear where the deck is and how to get back and forth from it
6668871 people dont know where to park or where the event is
6668872 you almost have to overdo it to direct people to these things

6668879 were trying to zero in and hone in on the things now and kind of cut back to things that we would probably have a chance to execute and use certainly this first ball game but probably even in the first month
6668880 one practice davis told us to take off our shoulder pads because were just fired up
6668881 whatever is the kick that we need to execute at that moment whether its an onside kick whether its a kickoff its a field goal a short field goal an extra point whoever gives us the best chance to make that play work thats whos going in the game

6668884 not only do you provide food for the kids you also provide an incentive to parents to send their kids to school because they know they will have a hot meal there

6668906 de raad van bestuur wil dat we daar kritisch naar kijken
6668907 het draait om een specifieke vraag ben je als leider werkelijk effectief binnen je organisatie of wil je alleen je eigen gedrag rechtvaardigen
6668908 de omgangsvormen en de cultuur op de werkvloer verbaasden ons zo is het met onze eigen ervaringen begonnen
6668909 in principe is theater niet nodig voor bedrijven het helpt alleen als alle managers snappen wat cht leidinggeven is dan hebben we een grote slag geslagen dat is echter nog niet het geval ze moeten eens goede gesprekken aanknopen met werknemers vragen wat hen bezighoudt wat ze plezierig vinden laatst ontmoette ik iemand die voorafgaand aan een functioneringsgesprek al een ingevuld formulier had gekregen zo iemand ligt daar dagen van wakker terwijl de manager zich niet bewust is van die impact
6668910 bij het cre ren van bewustzijn onder werknemers om de discussie op gang te brengen maar ook als het management geen beslissingen durft te nemen of er veel belangen spelen
6668911 in abstracte zin kan iedereen het eens zijn met bepaalde beslissingen maar mensen moeten zich realiseren wat het betekent voor hun werk er wordt rationeel naar de medewerkers gecommuniceerd terwijl zij juist emotie tonen daar zijn veel leidinggevenden bang voor maar je kunt het beter accepteren en de confrontatie aangaan daarnaast kunnen werknemers zich door theater makkelijker inleven in andere situaties en wordt de communicatie bevorderd
6668912 ik had vooraf mijn twijfels maar inmiddels weet ik wat theater kan doen het is een goed instrument om mensen in beweging te krijgen mensen kwamen eerst wat onwennig binnen maar wat ik niet voor mogelijk hield gebeurde mensen gingen elkaar de hand schudden of een praatje maken er kwam een ontspanningsgolf dat lukt op een andere manier vast ook wel maar niet al na twee uur
6668913 dat is belangrijk voor cultuurveranderingen het theater maakt je zo bewust van hoe en wie je bent als werknemer en wat je moet doen om dat te veranderen
6668914 als de voorstelling er eenmaal is komen er ook vragen voor het management mensen gaan vragen wat zij gaan doen aan deze situatie
6668915 je huurt gewoon iemand in die het slechtnieuwsgesprek voor je voert zou een cynische reactie kunnen zijn maar plezant geeft juist tegengas ook aan het management team
6668916 wij gaan kritisch met het bedrijf om de boosheid moet eruit bij werknemers en het management krijgt dat ongezouten om de oren met een theatervoorstelling wordt de stem van de medewerker hoorbaar anoniem wordt verteld wat jij altijd al dacht
6668917 het is pas een dialoog als het van twee kanten komt theater versnelt die dialoog
6668918 ik heb niet gezegd dat het in een dag zou lukken je moet volhouden
6668919 veranderen is een spel maar toneelspel is niet altijd veranderen je kunt alleen iets aan de cultuur doen als mensen er klaar voor zijn als de hakken in het zand worden gezet heeft het geen zin dan moet het management zelf aan de slag theater helpt dan niet het kan ondersteunend werken maar alleen toneel brengt geen verandering teweeg als je het isoleert tot iets eenmaligs en er geen vervolg aan wordt gegeven blijft het te oppervlakkig

6668926 i am ashamed of myself and i want to apologize to you i have been able to deliver only half my load because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your house because of my flaws you have to do all of this work and you dont get full value from your efforts

6668928 kita masih mencari timing yang tepat kalau nanti nilainya malah membebani pln ya harus kita tunda
6668929 de uitdaging is voor mij om te schrijven met licht maar licht is verbonden met schaduw de schaduw het donker is voor mij even belangrijk het laat de toeschouwer de ruimte om zichzelf erin te verliezen weg te dromen en zijn eigen creativiteit te gebruiken elk ziet wat hij wil zien
6668930 zelfs de meest aanstootgevende foto die met de kousenband is een reproductie van een schilderij van een zekere janssens uit 1930
6668931 het zijn allemaal klanten in mijn zaak in zingem als ik er wat in zie doe ik ze een voorstel en sommigen happen toe anderen haken af en op nog anderen moet ik een tijdje inpraten een naaktportet is voor negentig procent psychologie en voor tien procent fotografie
6668932 mijn modellen hebben ook inspraak in de manier waarop ze worden afgebeeld met andere woorden of ze herkenbaar zullen zijn of niet en door die openheid zijn de meesten heel tevreden over het resultaat ze waren hier bijna allemaal aanwezig op de opening
6668933 vaak krijg ik vrouwen over de vloer die mijn fotos zien en zeggen van mijn dochter zou je ook zon mooie foto kunnen maken
6668934 ik wilde de twee strikt gescheiden houden ook al boden een aantal kunstenaressen zich spontaan aan om naakt te worden gefotografeerd maar dat doe ik dan later wel eens
6668935 een viertal kunstenaressen die elkaar voorheen niet kenden vonden dat het wel leuk zou zijn om eens samen te exposeren en dan ben ik verder op zoek gegaan met als criterium dat elke discipline vertegenwoordigd moest zijn
6668936 ik ben dus wat men noemt een dorpsfotograaf maar ik kijk daar niet op neer het is dankzij mijn zaak dat ik dit soort dingen kan doen
6668937 het is gewoon makkelijker al dat gerotzooi met die kleren wat moet je daarmee
6668938 1000 nudes a history of erotic photography from 1839 1939
6668939 iets dat mij te binnenvalt bij het aanhalen van zon titel als 1000 nudes is dat men op dit onderwerp blijkbaar nooit uitgekeken raakt het zou nog 10 000 mogen zijn maar het onderwerp blijft fascinerend en iedere nieuwe beeld is opnieuw een openbaring en is even boeiend toen ik op de schildersklas zat was het ook zo dat n mannen n vrouwen liever vrouwelijke naakten schilderden ik stelde soms de vraag waarom en het antwoord was zeer eenvoudig naakte vrouwen zijn mooier of er nu erotiek bij te pas komt of niet een vrouwenlichaam is gewoon bijzonder mooi van vorm misschien het mooist dat god in al zijn wijsheid en vakmanschap ooit geschapen heeft dat de mannelijke en vrouwelijke aandacht onverbiddelijke naar dit beeld getrokken wordt is dus op puur esthetisch vlak absoluut geen wonder
6668940 savante 2 1993 haar beklag over maakt dat vrouwelijke plastische kunstenaars zo weinig in het mannenlichaam ge nteresseerd zijn
6668941 de vrouwelijke geslachtsdelen gingen haast altijd schuil achter schaamhaar sommige vrouwen bezaten veel meer schaamhaar dan owen en ik ooit voor mogelijk hadden gehouden
6668942 een vijftal keer reeds zijn mannen mij komen vragen om naakt gefotografeerd te worden maar ik heb daar geen zin in het waren trouwens allemaal homos ik heb daar niks tegen integendeel ik ben een groot bewonderaar van robert mapplethorpe die gespecialiseerd is in mannelijk naakt maar het is mijn ding niet
6668943 het is ook n g moeilijker om aan de muur te hangen
6668944 vandaar trouwens dat ook vrouwelijke fotografen meestal vrouwen als onderwerp nemen
6668945 en bijna allemaal komen ze nog naar mijn tentoonstellingen dat zou zeker niet waar zijn mocht dat vertrouwen er niet zijn mijn eerste model heb ik zelfs 25 jaar lang gefotografeerd want voor mij komt het model op de eerste plaats dan pas de locatie liefst buiten en ten derde het licht
6668946 ik denk dat lle vrouwen die er goed uitzien dat graag willen doen
6668947 het zijn nu eenmaal meestal jonge vrouwen die zich aanbieden
6668948 soms komt iemand binnen voor een portret en gaat buiten met een naaktfoto dikwijls zijn ze zelfs fier en mag ik de foto zonder problemen opnemen in een tentoonstelling
6668949 die fotos zouden mooi in een overzichtstentoonstelling passen en onlangs bekeek ik mezelf in de spiegel en bedacht ik dat ik dat misschien nog eens zou moeten doen
6668950 bettina is harder in haar fotos dan ik ze vereist van haar modellen dat ze uit de kleren gaan probeert hen tot het uiterste van wat ze aandurven te provoceren voor mij hoefde naakt niet altijd bettinas fotos zijn dan ook seksueler dan die van mij zij speelt vaak met mannelijke erotische clich s zoals sexy lingerie mijn fotos zijn wel sensueel ze zijn wel zinneprikkelend maar het gaat verder dan het kruis
6668951 ook al worden veelal naakte vrouwen in bizarre situaties afgebeeld toch kunnen ze eveneens gelezen worden als een portret van tokyo deze tweeledige stad bezit immers zowel aantrekkelijke vunzige als afstotelijke kanten
6668952 araki is in feite beroemd geworden met polaroidfotos van bloemen zijn erotische fotos die veel talrijker zijn werden meegesleurd en bij alle eigenschappen die je van hem opnoemt ontbreekt humor daar niet voor mij is dat een van de meest ironische fotografen van zijn tijd bizarre man weliswaar ik heb net een nieuw boek over hem in huis en dat geeft een zeer goed beeld van zijn werk dat mag ook wel op 700 blz hij doet een beetje met erotiek wat satie deed met de romantiek of zie ik dat verkeerd
6668953 het waren sensuele films zoals ik mijn tekeningen ook niet erotisch maar wel sensueel zou willen noemen ik hou van het vrouwelijk lichaam dat is waar maar ik zie dat als een lichaam in de ruimte eigenlijk ben ik zelfs op dat moment nog altijd een beetje binnenhuisarchitect
6668954 daar zit een evolutie in stilaan begin ik de achtergrond er wel bij te betrekken en soms hebben de vrouwen ook een kledingstuk aan
6668955 eigenlijk wel misschien is dat ook een evolutie net zoals ik nu ook twee vrouwen samen wil afbeelden
6668956 het is in het preutse vlaanderen inderdaad nog steeds een grote stap om uit de kleren te gaan de mannelijke partners van de modellen leggen immers altijd een link met seks hoewel die er helemaal niet is

6668981 killed by bullets even though they were protesting without weapons their bodies were never given back to their families
6668982 its too premature to provide any type of comment right now other than that weve been asked to investigate a situation between dugrenier and her coach
6668983 we have a process in place but beyond that any other comment on what it is were reviewing is a little premature right now

6669009 coaching in the final yesterday it was so good for my heart that so many people are engaged in womens soccer
6669010 if you looked at the quality of the game and the excitement it had everything
6669011 womens football is improving all the time and its getting tighter and tighter so now you have a handful of teams that can win the olympics and the world cup and thats really good for womens soccer overall
6669012 things are going to happen we are going to get beat every once in a while by these guys there are just way too good but we knew that we couldnt get down on ourselves and i think that confidence throughout all our games got us to where we are now
6669013 later on in the game especially when it went into overtime we could tell by their body language that they were really tired so that we knew that we had to take advantage of that
6669014 it says a lot about the team that we were able to come back after the opening loss here and after a huge devastating loss at the world cup last year and losing some players as well
6669015 its just so much fun playing for her weve found a new passion and really love for one another

6669312 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
6669313 all this talk about creation of indian mujahideen needs to be probed i would not be surprised if such an organization has been floated by fundamentalist bodies like the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vishwa hindu parishad with the sole intention of defaming muslims
6669314 i am not giving any clean chit to anyone but the manner adopted by the investigating agencies speaks of a blatant bias and a predetermined approach
6669315 an appropriate way to deal with the situation would be to constitute a high level committee comprising secular minded judicial luminaries like justice sachar justice krishna iyer and justice a a ahmadi it could even have representatives of hindu organizations like rss and vhp also let them question the arrested young muslim boys and if the committee is convinced that they are actually involved in terrorism let them be hanged

6669356 our draft resolution is a reconfirmation of the six point agreement and theres no territorial integrity in the six principles
6669357 we believe the six principles are clear and already implemented
6669358 what we see on the ground is the result of ambiguity
6669359 we have a presence of so called russian peacekeeping forces at key georgian choke points that will control economic life it will control humanitarian activities thats why clarifications are so important
6669360 theres no way that russian positions can be considered in line with the resolution
6669361 he tried to have a tough exterior like a shield to fit in
6669362 he was a good kid who was dealt some bad cards in life
6669363 it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school
6669364 i want to assure parents and others in this community that despite this tragic and isolated incident that our schools are safe
6669365 i wish to god that i could answer that persistent question that i have heard all day long
6669366 he got shot and started walking and he was holding his chest there was blood everywhere and then he fell and his arm hit me
6669367 i took off running and ran outside and called my mom

6669386 you cant let yourself get consumed by this you have to live every day and be happy
6669387 i wonder how were going to look when we get out of here
6669388 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6669389 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6669390 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6669391 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6669392 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can

6669418 looking over the horizon we think its time to start giving more attention to how networked people are starting to change governance
6669419 for all the attention we pay to the webs impact on the process of electing people to office and running advocacy campaigns
6669420 were seeing real changes beginning to happen in how public officials interact with citizens and in how both groups are using social software and the social web to try new approaches to addressing big problems
6669421 maybe 50 years of communism made them realize they needed to give their citizens these rights
6669422 this calls into question whether were really managing what we have out there
6669423 there is a real cost to not being able to get these things done in trust and productivity

6669427 many agencies are looking to the t s a as a model of success
6669428 this is why we have 24 000 web sites because we all rushed out and made them and there were no standards and no strategies
6669429 we dont want to go through that again the public is not served by 50 000 public blogs

6669516 we conducted the study without bias without interference from anyone
6669517 we have only one single minded goal in this effort
6669518 dr steven jones found it in the dust that landed in the entire area of lower manhattan and he finds it in the chunks of previously molten metal from the towers
6669519 if water had been available it is likely that sprinklers would have operated and the building may still be here today
6669520 it looks like they want to wrap up this investigation and blame the collapse on normal office fires
6669521 there is something wrong when some of the best new british plays become no more than boutique studio events only available to early bookers and insiders
6669522 did turn into a bit of a bad news story because people couldnt get in
6669523 virtually a private members club with membership and private donor schemes making tickets even harder to come by for the general public

6669525 i had a feeling about there being more demand for the sort of work i was talking about than the 250 seats we have and it occurred to me that this was the moment i could expand our brand
6669526 what were hoping is that the whole wyndhams season will get audiences back in to see straight plays

6669541 it only takes one idiot to use the stick part of it to lash out and a policeman or member of the public could be seriously injured
6669542 its terrible there is less and less of those buildings left
6669543 the museum owes its existence to those buildings its worrying to notice that they are disappearing
6669544 people are destroying and vandalising those houses including my family home which is being stripped
6669545 each house had four rooms and in each of those 10 people slept
6669546 the safety and security department promised to beef up security there
6669547 the proposals are a comprehensive approach to redevelopment and include safety features and high quality design that relate well to its context
6669548 all aspects of community and shopping facilities at shenley have already been upgraded including the extension of the car park paving and lighting renewal to enhance the bournville community as not only an exemplar of sustainable living but also as a place where families enjoy spending their time certainly turner amp townsend is proud to be involved in such an innovative scheme in the midlands

6669554 we decided not to rank the winners it is not an athletic competition where you can tell the first and second winners by a matter of seconds
6669555 what appears in television has now become something that we dream of a purpose for many people

6669569 de splitsing van beide limburgen is een historische vergissing die wij op een ander niveau willen goedmaken de grenzen moeten nog dunner worden onze munt taal en volkslied stoppen tenslotte niet aan de grens
6669570 er hangt iets in de lucht een nieuwe fase we spreken natuurlijk al decennia over euregios en grensoverschrijdende samenwerking maar je ziet dat de bestuurlijke instanties nu ook zo ver zijn allerlei wettelijke en juridische belemmeringen weg te halen daarom zie ik dit initiatief tot vergaande samenwerking niet als oude wijn in nieuwe zakken
6669571 de splitsing van de beide limburgen is een historische vergissing die wij op een ander niveau willen goedmaken de grenzen moeten dunner worden onze munt onze taal en ons volkslied stoppen ten slotte niet aan de grens
6669572 onze arbeidsbureaus aan beide zijden van de grens hebben een grote databank met openstaande vacatures de kans is groter voor een verpleegkundige in belgisch limburg dat ze in nederlands limburg aan de slag kan gaan

6669583 did you notice that as soon as i asked you to stare at each other some people began walking towards the outside of the group some people shyly held their arms together behind their backs how about all the giggling the smiling and the laughs most likely these are signs of discomfort or nervousness i want you to pay attention to this kind of reaction coming from yourself and the others do not censor yourself and avoid judging if a reaction is good or bad just acknowledge it

6669589 i did not encounter many hassles on my way back from south africa only that some officials initially asked for an import licence saying the volume of goods i was carrying indicated that i was importing them for commercial purposes but they finally let me go incredibly without me paying anything
6669590 naturally come to the rescue of consumers who now can use their money to buy more
6669591 there could be a marked improvement in established shops as well but buying from these might be the privilege of a few since their prices are prohibitive
6669592 i hope it suspension of import duty will be extended when it expires in december
6669593 the government knows too well that informal traders like myself are providing relief considering the widespread shortages of basic commodities compounded by the scaling down of operations by well established shops and wholesalers we require a lot of support through policies that ensure that our businesses though not formalised are boosted
6669594 we are making the best of the suspension in order to buy big volumes of goods for use in our households we have teamed up to mobilise enough money another member and i will be crossing the border to buy the goods
6669595 while we might be able to stock our houses with basic commodities the problem is that now and then we need to buy clothes for the children and ourselves but the big shops that sell them are charging unaffordable prices
6669596 the real reason for this blog is to comment on this ridiculous yet effing hilarious lil video someone posted of them running across the country naked thats been floating around the internet now for a week
6669597 i just saw this a few days ago and i was like wtf haha
6669598 we should all be proud as this agreement is a legacy of action that we can in all the years and decades point to as a legacy of life
6669599 it is a legacy of life because it talks to the livelihood of people as it focuses on the economic development of the areas in and around our mines
6669600 while we rightfully applaud ourselves for coming this far we should be mindful of the fact that in some very real sense the journey is only now beginning
6669601 it is the implementation of the agreement which shall determine the value of the paper it is written on and the ink with which it is written
6669602 i am particularly pleased that even as we sign the agreement there are already projects associated with it in the pipeline
6669603 we therefore start on a very auspicious note and it is said that a journey of success must begin on a positive note indeed
6669604 our planned partnership with the three tiers of government presents an enormous range of potential benefits to communities
6669605 als de kinderen op het speelplein frans spraken werden ze bestraft
6669606 kinderen die in de klas frans spraken moesten tegen de muur staan of strafregels schrijven maar dat werkte niet het kostte ook te veel energie van de leerkrachten
6669607 tegen die tijd wilden de vlaamse kinderen geen frans meer leren want ze legden de link met straf
6669608 we willen ze een taalbad geven met hetzelfde thema als tijdens de andere lessen van die week dus als ze met fruit bezig zijn leren ze de franse namen van dat fruit
6669609 we mogen alleen herhalen wat ze in het nederlands al geleerd hebben als ze het in de klas over appels en peren hebben gehad mag er in de franse les geen sinaasappel op tafel komen
6669610 dit is een nederlandstalige school en dat willen we ook zo houden in de klas wordt altijd nederlands gesproken behalve als de kinderen een keer triest of kwaad zijn dan gebruiken zij hun moedertaal wie doet dat niet als ze in de les toch frans spreken zeggen de leerkrachten nu allez komaan probeer t in het nederlands
6669611 op de ouderavonden spreken de meesters juffen en ik altijd nederlands een lid van de oudercommissie vertaalt dat in het frans voor de ouders die het anders niet begrijpen
6669612 de franstaligen en de anderstaligen weten hoe belangrijk kennis van het nederlands is om werk te vinden
6669613 maar voor de meeste franstaligen is het wel zo op het werk is er een plafond voor mensen die geen nederlands kennen
6669614 niet alleen vanwege de economie maar uit principe we leven in een drietalig land
6669615 maar inderdaad ook op mijn werk merk ik dat het belangrijk is nederlands te kennen
6669616 het is moeilijk voor franstaligen om na hun achtste jaar een andere taal te leren
6669617 het niveau van het onderwijs daalt en op de speelplaats klitten ze samen ik twijfel ook aan de inzet van die mensen om te integreren het is meer opportunisme zo maken hun kinderen meer kans op de arbeidsmarkt
6669618 de vlamingen leerden vroeger ook geen frans om voltaire te kunnen lezen maar omdat er in walloni werk was in de mijnen en de hoogovens natuurlijk leren de franstaligen nu vooral nederlands omdat ze anders in brussel geen baan kunnen krijgen dat is toch prima
6669619 dat gaat samen met de economische ontwikkeling het belang van walloni is afgenomen en dat van vlaanderen is opgekomen natuurlijk bestaat er nog altijd een frans superioriteitsgevoel wij spreken de taal van de verlichting van de rechten van de mens maar dat wordt wel minder

6669625 het verbaast mij ook dat er niet n tweetalige eliteschool is in brussel
6669626 maar het kan blijkbaar niet in vlaanderen is tweetalig onderwijs zelfs verboden
6669627 bedenk wel dat brussel ongeveer de laatste grote tweetalige stad is in europa alle andere zoals straatsburg en praag zijn in veel bloed gesmoord

6669656 there are too many marketers and charlatans out to make a fast buck on the expense of the vulnerable acid reflux sufferers simply cannot afford to spend their hard earned money on pricey heartburn cures and quick fixes only to be disappointed time and time again
6669657 is that even the so called natural approaches to the treatment of acid reflux that are aimed to cure acid reflux from within are either unrealistic impractical or are often the same one dimensional gimmick cures disguised as holistic solutions
6669658 there is simply no other way but the holistic way
6669659 the heartburn no more program was born out of these necessities
6669660 im only 3 weeks into the heartburn no more program and by following the principals of your program i am already experiencing significant relief in my acid reflux condition i have been battling with acid reflux food intolerance and leaky gut syndrome for 7 years and i am so thankful for the invaluable knowledge i have received from your book i will definitely recommend your book to anyone suffering from digestive disorders and chronic heartburn people can surely use your knowledge and expertise to recover form this painful condition and take responsibility over their health and well being this program is the answer to my prayers
6669661 but i sure am proud to have created a program that truly helps other acid reflux sufferers to end their physical pain and anguish for good and gain their lives back

6669669 no person is above the law and as such all irregularities raised with the board which warrant an investigation will be dealt with accordingly and within the parameters of the law company policies and procedures
6669670 in that case we will continue with the preparations to withdraw our labour that includes the call for the board to go they have a hidden agenda
6669671 we need to follow certain provisions in the labour act like giving the company notice we also want to ensure that all our workers countrywide know about the date and time for the strike it must be well co ordinated
6669672 the union indicated that they would await the outcome of the investigation against mr haimbili it is therefore surprising to learn of the demands and statements made by the union relating to the suspension of the board and reinstatement of the ceo mr haimbili through the media
6669673 be careful not to unduly incite workers clients and the general public
6669674 distracted by individuals who seem clearly to be pushing an agenda of their own
6669675 we suspect that they have been misinformed and find it a bit disappointing that they just accepted the word from the board anyway that will not prevent us from taking the matter further

6669683 il 73 degli internauti dicono di arrivare spesso alle notizie dopo essere andati nel web per altri scopi la percentuale praticamente la stessa di due anni fa 76 ma un decennio fa essa era molto inferiore 54 per cento nel 1998

6669719 choosing between politicians in our fake democracy is like choosing between coke and pepsi theyre all the same just with slightly different packaging
6669720 putting an x in a box every 4 or 5 years is not real democracy im fed up of seeing politicians forgetting about the promises they made to improve our lives once theyre in power
6669721 im sick of accepting the least worst candidate every one of us deserves to have a say in the way our own lives are run im voting nobody and starting to represent myself
6669722 nobody on the ballot represents me and the very nature of the system means nobody ever will nobody cares about the things were really passionate about and nobody will fight for them except us

6669733 this was the same time 2000 bbs operators in australia received threats to shut down their services to the public or face criminal proceedings they were told to shut down because they ran a completley different system to the internet using completly different protocols like zmodem fidonet amp bbs software making it impossible for government military academia or corporations to monitor them
6669734 if australians use their internet they will suffer physical harm be brainwashed for example possibly become a terrorist slave to a nation of militant mutants who most likely have lost all form of human reasoning due to their consumption of genetically modified corn

6669738 during the ploughshares action we worked together with deleuze philosophers from gothenburg university in sweden
6669739 it becomes a duty when there are violence and suffering in the world we use nonviolence contrary to my friend per i do not believe that we are practicing civil disobedience but rather upholding international law it is saab microwave which breaks the law delivering the missile firing system used during the war in iraq
6669740 we beat swords into ploughshares we do not protest against the missile firing system of saab microwave or the military radar system we choose to drop the protest as it becomes reactive and negative the time has come to intervene and become creative
6669741 they will hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks nation will not lift up sword against nation and never again will they train for war each of them will sit under his vine and under his fig tree with no one to make them afraid

6669750 it is one of his most imposing works due to its unusually large scale and the dramatic view down the nave of a church it is boldly executed with dramatic light effects streaming across the composition its well conceived figures including a funeral procession a mother nursing a baby near a freshly dug tomb and a dog relieving itself are symbolic of life and death and enliven the space
6669751 there are university students who could do their jobs better than you can
6669752 we must recognize the traditional way of combating crime has not been sufficient we must act in a more coordinated and vigorous manner
6669753 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6669754 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6669755 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6669756 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6669758 reflects john mccains remarkable record of leadership and service to america
6669759 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6669760 the speakers will address john mccains unmatched record of service and sacrifice for america and his vision for moving our nation forward to keep us safe and get our economy back on track
6669761 im voting for senator mccain ill certainly do what i can to help him get elected ill do it as governor of louisiana
6669762 so if he asked you to be on his ticket you would say no
6669763 hes not going to ask weve already said in private and public weve got the job that we want
6669764 i dont want to be vice president im not going to be the nominee
6669765 no no no windows open let me make that clear no windows open
6669766 senator mccain has again shown that he has the judgment the experience we need during these uncertain times just as he was right to call for the surge in iraq before it was popular he had called even last year he had said we should look at excluding russia from the g 8
6669767 he said when he looked in russian leader vladimir putins eyes he saw kgb very early on
6669768 this is another example that in these uncertain times we need experienced leadership we need someone like senator mccain who will take a stronger view a more experienced view when it comes to international security and protecting americas interests
6669769 senator obama would have a lot more credibility if now he admits that the surge has actually worked theres nothing about saying that he was wrong about it
6669770 the bottom line is this senator mccain has a pro life record he said he will have a pro life administration
6669771 you know last night senator obama had a chance in a church in california to talk about abortion he said he opposes late term abortions his voting record says different hes always voted for those things i wish he would just say honestly hes pro choice hes not a pro life candidate

6669808 why in the world would we need to deploy our missiles in syria against whom we have no enemies in the region
6669809 we understand russias stance regarding the breakaway regions and understand that it came in retaliation to georgian provocation
6669810 the timing of assads visit is very important it happens at the time when russia is very angry at the united states
6669811 it is highly possible that russia being so angered by the west and the united states now may sell something very nasty to syria

6669813 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6669814 we expect the home office to provide us at the information commissioners office with a copy of the internal investigation report and its findings
6669815 we will then decide what further action may be appropriate searching questions must be answered about what safeguards were in place to protect this information
6669816 its entrusted with a great deal of highly confidential material and it seems to be entirely incapable of keeping it secure
6669817 and the consequences are very serious theyre serious because it may lead to the identity of the people involved being revealed
6669818 one of the possible consequences is that they criminals will bring legal actions against the government and the taxpayer will then have to pay damages to people who appear to be pretty undeserving because of the governments incompetence

6669823 we have succeeded in winning back territory the longer term solution is that more power will be given to the afghanistan people

6669838 siempre ver con respeto cualquier iniciativa que promueva la educaci n en el terreno de una sexualidad integral
6669839 las aulas junto con las familias se convierten en las redes m s poderosas para prevenir y evitar
6669840 el proyecto hablamos de dios fue pensado y elaborado conjuntamente con la arquidi cesis primada de m xico para que se utilicen en las aulas como un recurso que favorezca el conocimiento y la vivencia de la religi n cat lica
6669841 este proyecto se busca acercar a los alumnos desde una perspectiva did ctica al mensaje cristiano darles recursos para que lo relacionen con sus experiencias diarias y con las tradiciones religiosas y culturales de su entorno se pretende tambi n proporcionar una visi n cristiana de los valores que repercuten en la dignidad de la persona en el respeto mutuo y en la convivencia social escolar y familiar
6669842 los mandamientos de la ley de dios y su funci n como expresi n del amor a dios y al pr jimo
6669843 vamos a fijarnos ahora en los mandamientos sexto y noveno ambos hacen referencia al sentido cristiano de la sexualidad
6669844 sexto mandamiento no cometer s actos impuros es decir respetar el propio cuerpo y el de lo dem s como corresponde a un hijo de dios
6669845 no consentir s pensamientos ni deseos impuros es decir pensar en los dem s con un coraz n limpio
6669846 el libro tu futuro en libertad por una sexualidad y salud reproductiva con responsabilidad constituye un importante complemento de informaci n para los j venes adicional a la que obtienen en su c rculo familiar medios de comunicaci n e instituciones de salud
6669847 lejos de cumplir con la tarea educativa la sep viola los derechos de los j venes
6669848 constituye un verdadero atraso anclado en la ignorancia y el oscurantismo derechista
6669849 creo que los gobiernos lejos de no encontrarse en esta ocasi n deben dialogar para sacar adelante un muy buen libro sobre el tema de sexualidad y un programa conjunto a escala nacional
6669850 reducen de manera importante los ndices de contagio de enfermedades de transmisi n sexual
6669851 nosotros no nos oponemos a que haya libros de texto sobre sexualidad al contrario son bienvenidos pero que no sean con una visi n sesgada de un tema tan importante como lo est n haciendo en este momento
6669852 est siendo abordado s lo desde la parte er tica del uso del cuerpo y no de la plenitud del ser humano
6669853 porque queremos que el tema de la sexualidad sea abordado de manera integral
6669854 no estamos en un pa s de censuras y nadie tiene la verdad absoluta en materia de educaci n
6669855 de alguna manera la legislaci n mexicana permite la aplicaci n de la prisi n vitalicia pues si bien las penalidades m ximas son de 50 a os de prisi n stas son acumulables por lo que hay gente que pr cticamente est purgando cadena perpetua
6669856 en el momento que nos convoquen nos hagan el llamado como secci n 10 vamos a participar ya hemos valorado esta postura
6669857 la ley de trabajadores al servicio del estado como tampoco en la de educaci n es m s ni siquiera en los estatutos del sindicato magisterial
6669858 desde cu ndo se castiga impartir conocimiento porque el tema est incluido en los programas de biolog a aqu s lo implicar a dar una explicaci n m s profunda
6669859 un acto que nos regresa a la edad media porque hay un tab para leer sobre ciertos temas aunque por otro lado no dicen nada sobre el contenido sexual que se difunde diariamente en la televisi n
6669860 los alumnos siempre tienen preguntas al respecto ante la falta de informaci n en su casa
6669861 est haciendo uso de un material no aprobado y eso va a su expediente
6669862 pretenda ser utilizado como libro de texto o material de apoyo primero debe pasar por la revisi n de un comit evaluador integrado por un panel de expertos quienes definir n si tiene pertinencia en sus contenidos en el uso pedag gico y si la informaci n cumple con criterios cient ficos
6669863 solicita que se considere como material complementario y que este libro sea enviado al comit de evaluaci n del rea que corresponde para esos fines
6669864 siempre ha estado preocupada por mantener actualizados los contenidos sobre educaci n sexual en sus libros de texto y ahora pareciera que es la primera vez que hablamos de estos temas cuando se vienen aplicando en todas las aulas del pa s desde el siglo pasado recuerden la pol mica desatada en los a os 1997 1998 cuando hab a grupos que objetaban el contenido que si era muy expl cito pero la secretar a siempre ha mantenido un enfoque cient fico liberal y progresista en estos temas
6669865 distribuir su libro en donde quiera en la acera en la entrada de las estaciones del metro o donde juzgue pertinente eso no podemos impedirlo pero dentro de las escuelas p blicas federales de educaci n b sica no podr circular y al no estar autorizado por la sep no ser objeto de estudio en la clase que corresponda porque s lo se puede trabajar con los materiales aprobados
6669866 lleva por lo menos un a o y se hace con anticipaci n para evitar premura y la secretar a de educaci n capitalina tiene pleno conocimiento de este procedimiento pues le hice saber al titular de ese organismo xel didriksson desde septiembre pasado cu l era la instancia y el mecanismo para someter a consideraci n de educaci n p blica cualquier texto que pretenda que llegue a las aulas
6669867 saben perfectamente con qu libros pueden trabajar y son aquellos que est n aprobados e incluidos en la lista oficial de la sep por lo que no puede ser utilizado ni como material de apoyo
6669868 nadie ajeno a la comunidad escolar tendr acceso a las planteles y a quienes pretendan hacerlo para distribuir un libro se les invitar a no hacerlo y retirarse
6669869 si hay preguntas sobre educaci n sexual los maestros est n capacitados para responder y no creo que ninguno se sienta sorprendido
6669870 pienso que debiera asumirse que es conveniente que hay que hacerlo a nivel nacional
6669871 no hacer debates que me parece que francamente est n muy fuera de tiempo a m me parece que no vale la pena ponerse a discutir sobre si es o no o si se va a poder o no dar a los j venes este libro se los vamos a dar no les tenemos que pedir permiso lo estoy diciendo literalmente no es un desaf o
6669872 espero que haya mucho di logo en torno a esto porque estoy profundamente convencida de que la educaci n sexual y reproductiva y el hablar sobre las relaciones responsables es extremadamente importante
6669873 los j venes est n en mayor riesgo y deben conocer su cuerpo y saber c mo protegerlo y tienen que saber c mo pueden hacerlo por lo cual apremio al gobierno de m xico y a todos los gobiernos reticentes que creen que esto va a a sovacar la moralidad quiero decirles que por el contrario esto puede hacerse de manera tal que se promuevan las relaciones responsables
6669874 el libro ha tenido una respuesta positiva ya que se trata de un instrumento educativo pertinente de una educaci n adecuada para todos nuestros j venes
6669875 ya lo sabemos por eso estamos haciendo el libro porque eso es lo que hace falta en la curr cula no hay materias sobre educaci n sexual para los j venes ni hay libros de texto que aborden el tema
6669876 yo no le estoy pidiendo a la sep que haga una materia a partir de mi libro ni que el libro sea de texto oficial simplemente lo que le solicit fue que nos permitieran su distribuci n
6669877 nosotros no queremos que el libro tu futuro en libertad se convierta en texto oficial es un libro escolar complementario fundamentalmente para el desarrollo humano de los j venes del distrito federal
6669878 creemos que vamos muy bien y que no va a pasar de algunos pronunciamientos rid culos de la derecha preocupantes de la sep y algunos exagerados de parte de la ultraderecha que siempre se manifiesta por la abstinencia pero pregunten en este foro sobre la abstinencia a ver que les dicen
6669879 los vamos a derrotar porque no podr n venir ahora a cuestionar la calidad de quienes elaboraron este extraordinario libro
6669880 por ley cualquier libro de texto debe previamente ser valorado por la unidad responsable de materiales educativos
6669881 han mostrado su intenci n de distribuirlo en su paquete de vales para tiles y uniformes escolares pero el libro no tiene reconocimiento oficial
6669882 la sep ha mantenido siempre una posici n de apertura y tiene un enfoque muy moderno sobre este tema no sabemos si el libro es bueno o no ya que no conocemos su contenido pues apenas nos lo hicieron llegar pero tiene que pasar por el proceso de valoraci n de un grupo multidisciplinario de la sep
6669883 cu ndo debes iniciar las relaciones sexuales la decisi n sobre cu ndo se deben iniciar las relaciones sexuales es muy personal y respetable hay personas que desde el principio disfrutan ampliamente de las relaciones sexuales hay tambi n quienes necesitan m s conocimiento de la otra persona para empezar y deciden esperar hasta que se estreche la relaci n se puede tomar d as semanas meses o a os antes de pasar a los contactos genitales lo importante es que nunca sea una imposici n sino una decisi n bien reflexionada y dialogada un acto libre responsable e informado
6669884 no tenemos que pedir permiso a nadie para distribuirlo es una obligaci n del gobierno hacerlo
6669885 si hay libertad si hay informaci n si ejercemos nuestros derechos si hay equidad de g nero en la relaci n de pareja si cesa la discriminaci n contra personas de preferencia sexual distinta vamos a vivir mejor de eso estamos convencidos
6669886 vamos a empezar a construir un libro ahora para la poblaci n de menor edad en la que hay que tener un enfoque preventivo pero que tengan en cuenta el desarrollo de su sexualidad desde muy temprana edad con informaci n cient fica laica y absolutamente veraz sin mentiras ni tapujos sobre el desarrollo de su sexualidad
6669887 la nica disponible y la m s efectiva se llama prevenci n y educaci n

6669897 i wouldnt say we are low on confidence or anything like that but it can take you a few games just for everyone to get into their stride
6669898 if we had taken the chances we made against dundee united then it might have been a different outcome we want to win every game so it is always a bad feeling when you drop points but it has gone now and it is far too early for anyone to start reading too much into anything

6669953 i told them to take the month of august explore their options
6669954 there are rumblings that the tigers may have to lop 40 million off their payroll before the beginning of the season but on tuesday manager
6669955 you dont want to know what i told him ill tell you that much
6669956 its not a surprise anymore when he goes out there and pitches like that
6669957 we had 12 plays the first game 18 the second therell be a few more this game
6669958 we had 12 plays the first game 18 the second therell be a few more this game
6669959 he probably will be excited that seems to be the nature of guys when they go play a team that they used to play for
6669960 i try to think i play every game with a certain level of intensity and confidence
6669961 thats how im going to approach this game as well
6669962 im going to win a game really try to get better and continue to help this team
6669963 im all right camp wears on everybody a little bit but were going to push through
6669964 im looking to see if they are going to play the kind of technique that we need for them to play fit where they need to fit concentrate on their pad level and pushing the pocket
6669965 we have 16 solid games to continue to work on that type of chemistry
6669966 we get a lot of good work out here in practice its just us jelling as a group of guys i dont feel thats going to be a problem
6669967 in shorts we all look good but in pads he looks good too i think you will like what he is able to bring to the table
6669968 were putting rubber suits on center dominic raiola and pumping him up to make him look a lot bigger
6669969 hes about as big of a defensive nose tackle as youll see in this league and well try to make him run sideline to sideline
6669970 im assuming ill get the same reception the other browns get
6669971 gene upshaw was a great guy for us guys in the nfl and he led us
6669972 he came in and we went from having nothing to all the things we have now he was a hall of fame player and an excellent businessman he led by example was always on point just a class act
6669973 i think gene had the best interests of the nfl at heart
6669974 we got called down the hall for a linebacker meeting
6669975 i walked into the room and walked into some clippers
6669976 in a sports city like this were the losers i dont blame the fans when they boo us but me and jeff dont want to leave this place a loser thats where we can turn it into a positive and say we got nowhere to go but up
6669977 when you lose as much as we have and given up as many sacks as we have yeah it wears on you
6669978 have we been unbelievable offensive linemen no but dominic has improved to a point where he should make the pro bowl and im working to improve after two down years
6669979 hes consistent every day and offensive coordinator jim collettos the same way this is the first time since ive been here where everything stops and starts with the running game and i believe thats how football should be played i couldnt be happier with the way our offense is designed
6669980 i think its gonna get the receivers more one on one matchups and its gonna soften up the pass rushers
6669981 if you sit back as a lineman and take on a pass rush the whole game all theyre doing is sprinting at you we believe this can work were not just gonna talk about trying to run the ball were gonna do it
6669982 middle of the plate up belt high pitches like that usually go for extra bases
6669983 i dont feel discomfort i feel like i can out there and throw a baseball
6669984 its easily the most frustrating time ive ever had weve tried some mechanical things and you feel good about an adjustment when you have a good start like i had against oakland
6669985 then you scuffle around against baltimore and then youre just terrible against texas
6669986 if i needed a swing and a miss or a pitch to get an out its always been a weapon it just hasnt been much of a weapon this year its killing me on both sides but especially with left handers i dont know what lefties are hitting off me this year 315 but i guarantee its just ridiculous
6669987 but at this level if you cant get hitters off your fastball with something else youre in trouble
6669988 but everything now is revolving around the fact its too inconsistent
6669989 its over finally after 301 games hopefully it doesnt take 301 more games for another
6669990 it only i was a fortune teller if i was miss cleo i would have been at home plate
6669991 nuri will be rather close to hong kong this afternoon and tonight with a chance of a direct hit

6669995 kevin is going to start we might as well cut to the chase
6669996 both of them have had a great camp kevin is going to take the first snaps and well see how it goes from there
6669997 its so close that its going to be a continual evaluation
6669998 its an honor to be named starter especially after what nate has done at cal
6669999 were in good hands having two great quarterbacks here i just have to prepare and get ready for this game
