6410000 im just hoping obama doesnt pick evan bayh because he is more of an unknown
6410001 there is going to be a lot of emphasis at this convention about reaching out to the needs of our younger constituents and getting them engaged in the process
6410002 for me it is really about the difference between a contemporary modern leader with obama and his platform of hope inspiration and change compared to john mccain who will be more of the same
6410003 sarasota county is on the map for being one of the counties that can go from a red county to a blue county
6410004 we are being watched at the state and national level
6410005 barack obama is really winning people with his message and his hope for americans
6410006 i think americans need not only hope but they need the specific plans he is offering with issues like families struggling in this economy there is no way that mccain can gloss over it and pretend that this is a good economy it is terrible
6410007 i am only going to send reminders to people who support obama
6410008 saddam hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors or the world with nuclear arms poison gas or biological weapons other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles with saddam there is one big difference he has used them not once but repeatedly i have no doubt today that left unchecked saddam hussein will use these terrible weapons again
6410009 you allow someone like saddam hussein to get nuclear weapons ballistic missiles chemical weapons biological weapons how many people is he going to kill with such weapons we are not going to allow him to succeed
6410010 threat posed by iraqs refusal to end its wmd programs
6410011 every nation has to be either for us or against us those who harbor terrorists or who finance them are going to pay a price
6410012 iraq continues to be a safe haven transit point or operational node for groups and individuals who direct violence against the united states saddams intelligence service supported financially ansar al islam whose members were being trained in al qaeda camps in afghanistan
6410013 husseins vigorous pursuit of biological chemical and nuclear weapons and his present and potential future support for terrorist acts and organizations make him a terrible danger to the people of the united states
6410014 my position is very clear the time has come for decisive action to eliminate the threat posed by saddam husseins wmds
6410015 every day saddam gets closer to his long term goal of nuclear capability
6410016 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat to the u s and our allies
6410017 to defend the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq
6410018 saddam is in material breach the legitimacy of the security council is at stake and if the security council does not call for the use of force i think we have little option but to act with a larger group of willing nations if possible and alone if we must
6410019 yes saddam has chemical weapons he has biological weapons he is trying to get nuclear weapons
6410020 the world is far safer with the removal of saddam
6410021 1 drugs and treatments clonazepam oral drug images from rxlist
6410022 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6410023 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6410024 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6410025 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6410026 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6410027 codeine cough syrup and even over the counter cough syrup s can be dangerous especially when mixed with other drugs
6410028 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6410029 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6410030 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6410031 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6410032 now that were in the general election the rnc money counts the dnc money counts so the truth is today john mccain has more cash on hand and more money than barack obama does
6410033 the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot later that day we were informed that it was a costume
6410034 michigan is for the most part a red state and its up to detroit and the
6410035 and unless we have someone out front whos able to speak and carry obamas message well its critical
6410036 we have a number of people who can stand with sen obama as a surrogate
6410037 shortly after the convention were going to have a come to jesus meeting to decide who are going to be the individuals to carry that message and carry obama around the state and around detroit
6410038 right now i think thats going to be a big challenge to make sure detroiters turn out
6410039 four key deficits budget savings balance of payments and leadership
6410040 cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
6410041 we need a grass roots effort to changed the thinking in congress
6410042 i dont see many young people in the audience so thats a disconcerting thing we need to have a lot of youth that are active in terms of shutting down this government this governments out of control its spending too much money we had representative ron paul who was running he was actually speaking wisdom and what did the republican party do they laughed at him
6410043 its exciting to see this but depressing because we have no one to solve these problems
6410044 the federal government is working with corporations to send out jobs to china and mexico
6410045 i see no local politicians involved in this where are they
6410046 we need to save money and our children today are not being trained to save in high school there isnt even training to balance a checkbook
6410047 we want instant gratification when i grew up you didnt buy something unless you needed it we need to look at ourselves in this
6410048 this problem is endemic to us all were buying things we dont want its up to us to say to congress cease and desist spending what we dont have
6410049 every local and county budget has to be balanced we need to move this to state and federal government
6410050 we need to get rid of the two party system and the stranglehold that the media has on that or we will always have what weve always had period
6410051 i think we really need to connect the dots between individuals and the government because the problems are very similar a lot of people have too much mortgage debt too much credit debt the more we create that financial discipline at the individual level i think it will cause a political groundswell that will shine the spotlight on the federal government as well
6410052 were in trouble unless we vote for someone who will raise taxes and no one will vote for them
6410053 i hope we can get a series of articles on what needs to be done we need to look at ourselves to stop spending what we dont have we are a spoiled country
6410054 our attitude should be not spending more than we have
6410055 ich sah wie das flugzeug in mehrere teile zerrissen wurde
6410056 dann gab es eine heftige explosion ich hatte zuerst gedacht die maschine w re dabei zu landen aber dann neigte sie sich pl tzlich zur seite und bohrte sich mit der rechten tragfl che in die erde
6410057 es war alles schwarz und verbrannt die leichen waren so hei dass wir uns beim wegtragen die finger verbrannten
6410058 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6410059 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6410060 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6410061 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6410062 its going to be hard for him to fight against the general tide thats an uphill battle for all republicans nationwide and i think thats whats really bringing him down
6410063 i dont think theres any firing offense for sununu but its a tough year for republicans
6410064 he is a very accomplished ambitious young legislator so its not that hes done a bad job
6410065 its just that his party is having a very tough time and he has a very strong opponent
6410066 in some ways mr sununu has got many things going for him except that he is a republican at a time when theres this shift and no one knows ultimately how strong this shift will be
6410067 but if were playing the guessing game than yeah this race leans democrat
6410068 if mr sununu is the beneficiary of what were seeing in the presidential race a trend for this race to be close and for states to vote along traditional lines he probably has a chance to take himself out of the most endangered category
6410069 theres no question jean shaheen will have the money she needs to be competitive in this race the democrats are going to make sure of that
6410070 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6410071 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6410072 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6410073 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6410074 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6410075 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6410076 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6410077 i have always believed that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms
6410078 but i also identify with the need for crime ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common sense effective safety measures
6410079 it is hopeless this one is like the other one they are all the same nothing will change dont expect change
6410080 hell have to be good to israel if not he wont be re elected to a second term
6410081 will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
6410082 the arabs need america to be straight and unbiased but anyway we feel that american policy will not be changed too much
6410083 one day he is with the palestinian cause one day hes with israel we have a saying here whats better a black dog or a white dog its all the same for us nothing will change
6410084 we rooted for this and that and nothing happened its deja vu
6410085 unless the americans realize that they really have to change and become more evenhanded and apply justice in the region things will be the same
6410086 obama is excellent he is direct he is like the successor to jfk
6410087 yes they are all bad but still obama might be a little less bad
6410088 for me it doesnt matter that hes black or his name is hussein
6410089 hes an american and so i disagree with most of what he says about the arab world i mean condoleezza rice was black and poor and she still invaded iraq
6410090 i think its very impressive that someone can start very poor and reach the top like this
6410091 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6410092 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6410093 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6410094 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6410095 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6410096 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6410097 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6410098 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6410099 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6410100 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6410101 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6410102 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6410103 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6410104 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6410105 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6410106 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6410107 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6410108 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6410109 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6410110 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6410111 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6410112 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6410113 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6410114 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6410115 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6410116 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6410117 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6410118 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6410119 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6410120 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6410121 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6410122 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6410123 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6410124 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6410125 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6410126 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6410127 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6410128 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6410129 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6410130 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6410131 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6410132 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6410133 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6410134 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena

6410137 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer

6410143 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6410144 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6410145 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6410146 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6410147 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6410148 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche

6410150 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6410151 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6410152 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6410153 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6410154 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

6410157 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6410158 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6410159 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6410160 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6410161 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6410162 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6410163 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6410164 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6410165 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6410166 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6410167 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6410168 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6410169 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6410170 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6410171 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6410172 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6410173 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6410174 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6410175 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6410176 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6410177 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6410178 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6410179 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6410180 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6410181 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6410182 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6410183 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6410184 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6410185 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6410186 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6410187 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6410188 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6410189 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
6410190 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
6410191 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6410192 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6410193 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6410194 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6410195 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6410196 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6410197 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6410198 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6410199 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6410200 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6410201 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6410202 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6410203 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6410204 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6410205 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6410206 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6410207 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6410208 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6410209 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6410210 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6410211 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6410212 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6410213 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6410214 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6410215 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6410216 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6410217 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6410218 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6410219 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6410220 the movie revolves around a singular day when jimmy page the edge and jack white first met and sat down together to share their stories teach and play
6410221 captures the guitarists as each explains and demonstrates how he changed the sound of the electric guitar to suit his own distinctive musical style
6410222 hey this makes sense its charles krauthammer and hes talking on this subject this will convince you
6410223 the roman catholic church which was supposed to carry the light of the gospel plunged the world into the dark ages
6410224 john paul ii will be remembered for staring down communism and embracing people of all faiths and colors
6410225 they found there wasnt a machine in the country they know of that takes over 25 stone in weight
6410226 i am just at the weight but because of where i hold my weight i am not quite sure because it also goes on the circumference of you
6410227 they would have to measure the size of the hole in the scanner and the size of my stomach and i havent been brave enough to ask that question
6410228 we simply cant put patients on above a certain weight limit
6410229 if we go close to the limit the risk is the patient might go into the scanner but the table will then jam and perhaps we cant get them out
6410230 weve developed new technology in ultra sound which will actually allow doctors to see through the extra fat to get a better image and therefore a better diagnosis
6410231 simply encouraging people to lose weight is not the answer
6410232 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6410233 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6410234 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6410235 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6410236 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6410237 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6410238 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6410239 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6410240 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6410241 in new york we dont think of alternative power as something that we just import from other parts of the nation
6410242 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6410243 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6410244 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6410245 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6410246 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6410247 fourie is definitely more difficult to counter i know hes just coming back from injury but hes still a great player and was by far the best halfback at the world cup
6410248 he directs the boks around the park and when he plays well the boks play well fourie doesnt need the forwards performing to dominate he gets the pack going forward by dictating where he wants them to go
6410249 we enjoy fast games traditionally that has suited us we have some quick guys out there at the back who revel in those type of games an afternoon match also helps us as there shouldnt be much dew around
6410250 in terms of my own game its not the greatest aspect but weve got gitss left boot and barnesy has an exceptional short kicking game its an aspect weve looked to work on under robbie deans where we play counter attacking games to work on our kicking and catching skills in test footie you definitely need it
6410251 for me im just grateful for another opportunity to go out there and show what i can do its going to be great going up against the best players in the world its hard to analyse the aussies as they do alter their game every week its hard to plan for them
6410252 weve got to be patient and put a few phases together last week we were too rushed and kept trying to score off first phase if we can be patient and cut out the errors we should do well
6410253 its about taking your opportunities and making the right decisions i dont think it would be wise to play risky rugby this weekend just because the bonus point is needed
6410254 if you look back at the stormers final game against the lions in the super 14 where the bonus point was needed for play off qualification it would have been wise to keep to our structure rather than run everything
6410255 ive been very impressed with both of them on defence there are a couple of weaknesses that we have identified elsewhere that we will definitely be looking to exploit but i think a guy like barnes has been very solid
6410256 im just going to go all out and try to perform in the next two tests
6410257 it is starting to get a bit tough but there is only two more weeks and i need to grind it out
6410258 it was the american colonels even more than the generals who were asking for more troops
6410259 we believe in why we are fighting here and we want to finish this fight we know we can win it
6410260 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6410261 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6410262 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6410263 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

6410267 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keeps on skyrocketing
6410268 when you find out that you lost your healthcare your pension or you never had it it turns out youre not the only one
6410269 millions of americans have been going through that same loss of security
6410270 these tend to be folks that relocate here they tend to be younger voters also folks who obviously based on their lifestyle would be open to the prescription for change sen obama is offering
6410271 barack obama can spend all the money in the world in some of these republican leaning states but he will still be the most inexperienced presidential candidate in the modern era and he will still have the most liberal record in the united states senate
6410272 he is more liberal than a lot of the state
6410273 its going to be a very difficult race for him in north carolina
6410274 he cant make any promises that are going to help us tomorrow
6410275 its going to be a long time coming out of this
6410276 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6410277 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6410278 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late
6410279 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6410280 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6410281 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6410282 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6410283 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6410284 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6410285 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6410286 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6410287 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6410288 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6410289 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6410290 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6410291 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6410292 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6410293 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6410294 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6410295 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6410296 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6410297 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6410298 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6410299 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6410300 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6410301 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6410302 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6410303 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6410304 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6410305 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6410306 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6410307 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6410308 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6410309 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6410310 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6410311 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6410312 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6410313 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6410314 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6410315 arsenals of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them
6410316 if we have to use force it is because we are america we see further into the future

6410319 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6410320 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6410321 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6410322 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6410323 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6410324 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6410325 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6410326 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6410327 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6410328 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6410329 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6410330 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6410331 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6410332 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6410333 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6410334 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6410335 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6410336 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6410337 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6410338 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6410339 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6410340 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6410341 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6410342 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6410343 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6410344 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6410345 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6410346 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6410347 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6410348 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6410349 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6410350 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6410351 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
6410352 its time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
6410353 everyone says america is the land of opportunity for renewables
6410354 we believe that we have selected talented young men who will make the wv blazers very competitive in the aba and who will be excellent role models off the basketball court as well
6410355 we are excited about the upcoming season and we are looking forward to filling the remaining positions on our roster
6410356 we anticipate a good turnout for the next round of tryouts especially after young men find out the quality of players that have been selected so far we are sure they will want to join these players for an exciting and successful season
6410357 we are pleased to have the aba signed to the network this is our first basketball league for the network and it represents a strong showing across the united states the aba has been around quite a long time and is rich in history for basketball this is a good fit for the network and it is the type of quality programming we intend to provide to sports fans all over
6410358 we are very pleased to be working with fanz tv
6410359 one of the key elements of this agreement is the production fanz tv will be sending in a full production truck cameras and crew to make these games very special with a high quality look while fanz tv does not have huge national distribution yet the network reaches millions of homes nationwide and it will give fans everywhere an opportunity to see the outstanding quality and excitement of the aba game
6410360 fanz tv will air the game of the week live from the southern california area for the season the league will also have other teams that produce games that will then be sent to fanz tv for airing on a tape delayed basis
6410361 this will be a first for both parties to air a live aba event on over the air television stations something we are extremely excited about and thrilled at the possibilities for the product and the sponsors
6410362 some on the first week on the job have battled me on what they think is right and wrong
6410363 the millennial generation really feels comfortable approaching adults and asking for advice
6410364 the characterizations of the generation are somewhat true we were raised to not be personally responsible and to feel entitled
6410365 a lot of people my age struggle with it those who dont just dont realize it yet i want to hear from somebody im doing a good job
6410366 the convention showed me that was not the way it works and that its good to go smaller
6410367 i thought maybe i dont want to do the news business i looked at some pr jobs and the pay was about 15 000 more than i ended up getting
6410368 i also had a minor in public relations so i started to look at a lot of different things
6410369 students are individuals of course but a lot of them have unrealistic expectations
6410370 this generation seems to have a sense of entitlement they think that a degree is enough
6410371 higher pay is the real desire the students want they are accustomed to having more
6410372 some are pretty realistic they know this is the route but some cant believe its that way after 20 years
6410373 there are lots of good people out there you just have to look
6410374 i like to make sure theyve had an internship or some practical experience
6410375 they have degrees but its all theory they have not had practical experience
6410376 i dont see enough people who really are as curious as i would like
6410377 i dont think this generation is as curious as the last couple of generations
6410378 its more a job than a calling for my generation it was something we really aspired to do
6410379 newborn broadcasters seem so timid these days and not so curious
6410380 im closer to 50 than i am to 40 but still seem to have more passion and zest for this job than some of the recruits who come through the door
6410381 they want to know every week which is good i try to take the time to do it
6410382 i think we get a good amount of people that have a lot to learn know it and want the coaching
6410383 people in college who are reading this now should look around and see that they are better than the competition
6410384 some students are still a little more casual in their approach to the job search
6410385 teachers who are brutally honest with students have done them a favor
6410386 gen xers do not have a lot of faith in anyone
6410387 so when a millennial employee comes to a gen x manager and starts to ask for personal advice the gen xer instantly wonders why would you trust the organization
6410388 they crave that sense of loyalty and connection and group
6410389 no one did it for us is often what gen x managers think
6410390 gen xers have a huge chip on their shoulders there is anger
6410391 some dont know the senators in their own home state
6410392 the court adopts a recommendation of probation to serve ten days in the department of corrections all but five suspended with additional fifty hours of community service
6410393 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6410394 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6410395 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6410396 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6410397 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6410398 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6410399 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6410400 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6410401 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6410402 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6410403 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes

6410406 trying to make excuses or to yell about my articles
6410407 americans end up getting bad information and supporting bad decisions and strategies
6410408 i think when you get so distant from the facts as as guys like limbaugh and sean hannity do yeah i think that tends to corrupt the dialogue
6410409 defend and explain one example where i said something that was so false
6410410 youre not listening susan youve got to learn something he saddam had weapons of mass destruction he promised to disclose them and he didnt do it you would have let him go free we decided to hold him accountable
6410411 and kay had also not discovered any chemical or biological weapons
6410412 colin powell just had a great piece that he had in the paper today he was there in iraq he said things couldnt have been better
6410413 iraq has come very far but serious problems remain starting with security american commanders and troops told me of the many threats they face from leftover loyalists who want to return iraq to the dark days of saddam from criminals who were set loose on iraqi society when saddam emptied the jails and increasingly from outside terrorists who have come to iraq to open a new front in their campaign against the civilized world
6410414 and in northern iraq today this very day al qaeda is operating camps there and they are attacking the kurds in the north and this has been well documented and well chronicled now if youre going to go after al qaeda in every aspect and obviously they have the support of saddam or were not
6410415 kay also called a speech where cheney made the claim there was a link to al qaeda
6410416 after 9 11 liberal democrats at first showed little interest in the investigation of the roots of this massive intelligence failure bush and his team made it clear that determining the causes of americas security failures and finding and remedying its weak points would be central to their mission
6410417 president bush took a few minutes during his trip to europe thursday to voice his opposition to establishing a special commission to probe how the government dealt with terror warnings before sept 11
6410418 first of all this president you know and i know and everybody knows inherited a recession it was by every definition a recession
6410419 the recession officially began in 2001 months after bush was sworn in according to the universally acknowledged arbiter of such things the national bureau of economic research and president bush at other times has also said so himself
6410420 the hispanic community got to know him bush in texas they went almost overwhelming for him he more than quadrupled the hispanic vote that he got in that state
6410421 look weve had these reports very disturbing reports and i have actually spoken to people that have confirmed a lot of the reports about the trashing of the white house when the clintons left the white house pornographic materials left in the printers they cut the phone lines lewd and crude messages on phone machines stripping of anything that was not bolted down on air force one 200 000 in furniture taken out
6410422 is it you hate this president or that you hate america
6410423 governor why wouldnt anyone want to say the pledge of allegiance unless they detested their own country or were ignorant of its greatness
6410424 you could explain something about your magazine the nation lisa featherstone writing about the hate america march the anti war march that took place over the weekend
6410425 i hate america this is the extreme left there is a portion of the left not everybody whos left that does hate this country and blame this country for the ills of the world
6410426 you dont like this country do you you think this is an evil country by your description of it right here you think its a bad country
6410427 it doesnt say anywhere in the constitution this idea of the separation of church and state
6410428 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
6410429 the senators and representatives before mentioned and the members of the several state legislatures and all executive and judicial officers both of the united states and of the several states shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
6410430 you want to refer to some liberal activist judge thats fine but im going to go directly to the source the author of the bill of rights james madison hired the first chaplain in 1789 and i gotta tell ya somethin i think the author of the bill of rights knows more about the original intent no offense to you and your liberal atheist activism knows more about it than you do
6410431 is the appointment of chaplains to the two houses of congress consistent with the constitution and with the pure principle of religious freedom in strictness the answer on both points must be in the negative
6410432 but the alabama constitution which chief justice roy moore is sworn to uphold clearly it says as a matter of fact that the recognition of god is the foundation of that states constitution
6410433 that no religion shall be established by law that no preference shall be given by law to any religious sect society denomination or mode of worship that no one shall be compelled by law to attend any place of worship nor to pay any tithes taxes or other rate for building or repairing any place of worship or for maintaining any minister or ministry that no religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under this state and that the civil rights privileges and capacities of any citizen shall not be in any manner affected by his religious principles
6410434 betsy theyre not going to lose it public housing because if you work less than 30 hours a week if you work more than 30 hours a week you dont have to do it if youre between the ages of 18 and 62 and youre not legally disabled and you have free housing in other words
6410435 no wait a second sean let me correct you most people in public housing are not receiving free housing many of them are paying almost market rates
6410436 betsy that is so ridiculous and so false its hardly even worth spending the time
6410437 but he senator kerry wanted to cancel every major weapons system specific votes that he would have canceled the weapons systems we now use
6410438 in 1991 kerry opposed an amendment to impose an arbitrary 2 percent cut in the military budget in 1992 he opposed an amendment to cut pentagon intelligence programs by 1 billion in 1994 he voted against a motion to cut 30 5 billion from the defense budget over the next five years and to redistribute the money to programs for education and the disabled that same year he opposed an amendment to postpone construction of a new aircraft carrier in 1996 he opposed a motion to cut six f 18 jet fighters from the budget in 1999 he voted against a motion to terminate the trident ii missile
6410439 if he kerry had his way and the cia would almost be nonexistent
6410440 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6410441 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6410442 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6410443 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6410444 i look at the aspects of our ticket where were strongest and where were most in need of help and joe brings more to the ticket than any of the other people whose names are mentioned as finalists
6410445 with all due respect and i know the other folks in consideration theyre a wonderful group but theyre not really all that close
6410446 you guys have better things to do im not the guy
6410447 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6410448 there are droughts in north and south carolina parts of california most of new zealand and this idiot who firmly believes he can induce rain by prayer is wasting it by asking his lord and savior to play a political prank its not boyish humor and youre a selfish hypocrite
6410449 the democratic vice presidential prick in 2000 who now is an independent
6410450 following the lead of political families like the strogers and lipinskis illinois senate president emil jones is anointing one of his children to take over for him when he retires in january
6410451 his preference yes would be to see his son serve
6410452 in rural minnesota one district is skipping classes every monday to save fuel nationwide at least 14 other districts are switching to four day weeks and dozens more are considering it
6410453 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks

6410459 its attracting interest from all sorts of private individuals interested in buying a small corner of england and one of with such one of tavistocks most noted local landmarks
6410460 lutyens wanted the pimple to be a place where people could visit and enjoy the stunning views over dartmoor and into cornwall
6410461 it is so unique that it was difficult to put a price on
6410462 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6410463 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6410464 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6410465 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6410466 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6410467 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6410468 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6410469 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6410470 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6410471 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6410472 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6410473 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6410474 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6410475 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6410476 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6410477 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6410478 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6410479 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6410480 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6410481 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6410482 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6410483 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6410484 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6410485 within striking distance of winning strange as that may sound
6410486 i honor his service i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6410487 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6410488 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6410489 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
6410490 nous restons en contact avec les autorit s espagnoles pour d terminer si dautres ressortissants fran ais auraient pu tre pr sents sur ce vol

6410504 la situation est effectivement plus grave que lann e derni re
6410505 je peux d crire la situation en afghanistan seulement avec les mots de d sespoir pauvret maladie manque absolu de travail quelconque et une conomie artificielle adapt e aux besoins des ong trang res et des forces arm es chaque jour les afghans sont pouss s davantage bout chaque jour les gens sont pr occup s seulement de savoir o ils peuvent se procurer assez dargent pour se payer un repas chaud mais pour la plupart la seule nourriture est un morceau de pain quelques uns ont peut tre plus de chance et mangent une fois par jour un repas chaud mais pour la majorit des gens cest un vrai luxe

6410517 has a habit of straying off message and making impolitic comments
6410518 obama has shown himself more not less in need of an attack dog able to engage mccain on national security
6410519 e vents in georgia and pakistan have made the prospect that obama will choose
6410520 fill the bill of the excitement of the newcomer on the national stage
6410521 p ick a running mate who is a conservative white guy or a general or a republican
6410522 obama is likely to choose someone relatively safe and avoid taking a chance with a game changing selection
6410523 someone who would fill perceived holes in his r sum
6410524 who would reinforce his promise of change or one who might help him win a contested state
6410525 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
6410526 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6410527 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
6410528 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
6410529 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
6410530 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
6410531 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6410532 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6410533 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6410534 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6410535 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6410536 the cord from the blinds was wrapped round her neck under her neck it was pulling her forward
6410537 here was an active child that did not appreciate normal dangers that other children might appreciate
6410538 you removed the cord and started resuscitation and called billy to get the phone and you dialled 999 and continued to try to revive lucy until the paramedics came and took her off to poole hospital but sadly there was nothing they could do for her
6410539 it would have been possible for lucy to reach the cord and to somehow place her head through it in a manner which would be consistent with the ligature mark around her neck
6410540 i could find no information to make me believe this is anything other than a tragic accident
6410541 lucy was always on the go and into everything not thinking of the consequences of what would happen if she tried something out
6410542 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6410543 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6410544 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6410545 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6410546 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6410547 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
6410548 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
6410549 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
6410550 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
6410551 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
6410552 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
6410553 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
6410554 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
6410555 many in the christian right tend to get their information
6410556 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6410557 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6410558 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6410559 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

6410564 here let me show you my 500 slide presentation of our trip
6410565 i am confident that we have selected an outstanding youth games team to compete in pune with the standards continuing to rise with every games cycle
6410566 whilst winning medals is important the major benefit of the commonwealth youth games is exposing young athletes to this level of competition in a multi sport environment
6410567 it is the ideal preparation event for the commonwealth games in delhi in 2010 and glasgow in 2014
6410568 the commonwealth youth games will provide competition experience and hopefully a stepping stone for our young stars as they eye the commonwealth games in delhi in 2010 and on home soil in glasgow in 2014
6410569 as they fly the flag for scotland at the commonwealth youth games in india these young athletes carry the hopes and good wishes of a nation
6410570 our models estimate that there are approximately 40 new hiv infections a day in our country safe male circumcision for hiv prevention is now being given attention in namibia and other african countries as a potential tool our prevention package
6410571 we know that in some communities circumcision is a well established practice careful assessment and conversation with leaders and communities continues to take place to plan for a scale up of safe male circumcision services in namibia
6410572 hiv negative men who engage in sexual activity before they have healed from the circumcision are also at risk of becoming infected with hiv

6410589 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6410590 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6410591 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6410592 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6410593 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6410594 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6410595 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6410596 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6410597 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6410598 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6410599 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6410600 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
6410601 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6410602 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6410603 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
6410604 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6410605 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
6410606 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
6410607 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
6410608 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
6410609 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
6410610 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6410611 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6410612 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6410613 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6410614 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6410615 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6410616 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6410617 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6410618 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
6410619 es gibt viele fahrer die in die formel 1 kommen und man wei dass sie gut sind aber ihnen fehlt irgendeine zutat ich denke er kubica hat diese extra zutat es w rde mich sehr berraschen wenn er bei den top teams nicht auf der liste st nde
6410620 trotzdem ist er da oben in der n he der wm spitze er hat unmengen an nat rlichem talent aber manchmal sieht es einfach so aus als w re er nicht hundertprozentig engagiert wenn ich ein teambesitzer w re und viel f r einen fahrer bezahlte dann w rde ich wissen wollen dass der typ sein bestes gibt
6410621 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6410622 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6410623 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6410624 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6410625 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6410626 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in
6410627 theres no way in hell im voting for the old establishment

6410647 hayek recognised this paradoxical inconstancy and proposed that we must simply learn to
6410648 herein lies the core challenge for conservatives as the impact of neo liberalism cannot be effectively quarantined from its effect on the family and beyond the family to other sub economic reciprocal relationships within communities and other social and spiritual associations
6410649 for human beings living in a civilised community defined not by market forces but rather from an entirely different values base is a case in point

6410651 the reality was that he himself was dead by then

6410653 the shock and distress you have caused to friends and family must be considerable you will have to live with that guilt
6410654 a lot of people moved out here from the district because they wanted to be in the burbs and raise their kids here
6410655 you find you can get a bigger house thats in pretty close and a yard but there were all these predatory loans thats all it was they didnt realize how the loans worked because when folks are lying to you you dont know any better then when they find out they are in trouble they start to panic and they end up losing their homes
6410656 we figured most of our cases would come from baltimore but the majority of the cases were are investigating are in prince georges county pg county is at the top of our list
6410657 they call three for four times a day and they leave something in my mailbox almost every day
6410658 sometimes i end up talking to them because they say florence how are you and i answer before i realize who they are theyve called on my cell phone it just doesnt stop
6410659 and its striking that despite all the news about this problem we still see people going out and using these high pressure and predatory tactics
6410660 we do have our share of foreclosure fraud in white neighborhoods but it doesnt seem to be the same frenzy we have in prince georges county

6410679 for those now living within the extended order the modern economy gain from not treating one another as neighbors and by applying rules of the extended order such as those of several property and contract instead of the rules of solidarity and altruism an order in which everyone treated his neighbor as himself would be one where comparatively few could be fruitful and multiply
6410680 mutual non monetary exchanges have embedded within them indeed create personal and community relationships these obligations are the stuff of community and generalized reciprocity while the market hungrily offers its commodified supports food and all kinds of services delivered to the door where the prospect of profit exists the engine for non monetary community creation is a weaker machine one that is starved in the face of time pressures in streets where work sucks both time and place
6410681 in truth scholars don t know yet what if any the exact links are between these ominous trends and the lessening amounts of time parents spend with children it s enough to observe that children say they want more time with their parents and parents say they regret not spending more time with their children
6410682 the invisible hand represents the forces of supply and demand in competitive markets the invisible heart represents family values of love obligation and reciprocity the invisible hand is about achievement the invisible heart is about care for others the hand and heart are interdependent but they are also in conflict the only way to balance them successfully is to find fair ways of rewarding those who care for other people this is not a problem that economists or business people have taken seriously they have generally assumed that god nature the family and super mom or some combination thereof would automatically provide whatever care was needed
6410683 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6410684 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6410685 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6410686 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6410687 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6410688 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6410689 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6410690 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6410691 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6410692 when the ball goes too high you cant see it too easy
6410693 but its ok because if it is raining for us it is raining for them
6410694 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6410695 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6410696 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6410697 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6410698 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6410699 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6410700 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6410701 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6410702 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border

6410704 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
6410705 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
6410706 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
6410707 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
6410708 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
6410709 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
6410710 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
6410711 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
6410712 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6410713 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6410714 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
6410715 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6410716 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6410717 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6410718 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6410719 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6410720 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6410721 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6410722 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6410723 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6410724 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6410725 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6410726 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6410727 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6410728 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6410729 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

6410750 as you know attorney general guidelines were first implemented in the wake of the fbi abuses of the 1960s and 1970s and serve as one of the most important bulwarks against future abuses
6410751 given the importance of these guidelines providing a period of time for public comment would be a reasonable and responsible way to move forward and achieve the best possible end result
6410752 the guidelines will require all activities to have a valid purpose
6410753 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6410754 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6410755 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6410756 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6410757 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6410758 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6410759 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6410760 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6410761 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6410762 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6410763 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6410764 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6410765 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6410766 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6410767 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6410768 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6410769 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6410770 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6410771 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6410772 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6410773 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6410774 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6410775 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6410776 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6410777 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6410778 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6410779 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6410780 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6410781 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6410782 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6410783 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6410784 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6410785 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6410786 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6410787 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6410788 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6410789 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6410790 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6410791 adopt e au moment o la crise financi re internationale produisait ses premiers effets cette loi a largement att nu les cons quences du ralentissement conomique
6410792 au total actuellement ce sont pr s de six millions de salari s qui ont d clar des heures suppl mentaires exon r es
6410793 si vous mettez les heures sup lisf qui finance le capital des petites et moyennes entreprises et le cr dit dimp t recherche je crois quon a un triptyque qui est efficace sur le plan structurel
6410794 if you do not tell the truth about yourself you cannot tell it about other people
6410795 hard to believe that with our aggressive national media covering a presidential campaign that obama and daley could mange this cover up in plain sight yeah real hard
6410796 the fact is that all russian politicians are clever the stupid ones are all dead by contrast america in its complacency promotes dullards a deadly miscommunication arises from this asymmetry the russians cannot believe that the americans are as stupid as they look
6410797 this is certainly the most unusual thing i have come across during my 10 years as a lifeboatman
6410798 its been well made its been cemented into the cliffs sealed round the entrance hatch the rope ladders tied down with eye bolts so its been professionally done

6410803 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6410804 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6410805 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6410806 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6410807 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6410808 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6410809 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6410810 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6410811 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6410812 definitivamente ver n m s independencia en este disco trabaj con mucha gente muy diferente y aprend de sus h bitos y de lo bien que trabajaron conmigo as que podr n escuchar diferentes voces sin duda ser mucho m s sensual

6410816 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6410817 they told me there are going to be resources here
6410818 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6410819 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6410820 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6410821 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6410822 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6410823 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6410824 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6410825 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6410826 in the last 24 hours i have been contacted by 4 major non sports based companies who watched the program after me giving them the details all of them wish to now pursue some kind of involvement
6410827 my intent was never just to get one event filmed but to build on it and get several more televised certainly next year the british will be shown in 2 parts the worlds even more but i am working on several other big events ill provide details shortly more events more coverage for everyone
6410828 to make sure that any timelines reflect what we believe can be done
6410829 the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6410830 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now

6410833 at agora n o sei se a petrobr s pode tomar conta da reserva
6410834 as descobertas feitas com o investimento da petrobr s colocaram o brasil numa situa o altamente privilegiada entre os pa ses detentores de grandes reservas de petr leo
6410835 n o sei a quantidade exata mas penso que certamente tem menos do que desejar amos mas muito mais do que aquilo que a gente pensou em algum momento ter nesse pa s ningu m precisa me dizer os n meros porque vejo isso estampado na cara dos diretores da petrobr s
6410836 a petrobr s t o grande e tem tanto dinheiro que s vezes esnoba algumas coisas mas aos poucos vamos mostrando que n o o brasil que da petrobr s mas a petrobr s que do brasil

6410856 one would assume we would have to help them rebuild because they are a partner in the war on terror theyve been helpful they are going to ask us i am sure to replace and rebuild
6410857 i think that assistance is probably going to happen its a matter of how much and how fast
6410858 the political leaders saw what was coming and they got out of a traditional mode of approaching economic development
6410859 n o vamos copiar a experi ncia de ningu m claro que aprendemos com outros modelos como o noruegu s mas vamos criar um modelo brasileiro
6410860 o governo ainda n o decidiu como far a gest o dessa riqueza mas ela n o ser usada em benef cio da empresa a ou b mesmo que seja estatal mas em benef cio da popula o parte do dinheiro deve ser aplicado em sa de em educa o para aumentar reservas e para pagar d vidas

6410879 that all the worlds super villains decided to band together in 1986 and use their vast collective powers
6410880 we have seen images of these towers on television and the internet and to now see them gone is a significant development like here the basque people want a peaceful solution to the conflict in our country despite this the spanish and french have continued in their campaign of repression torture and arrests we denounce these repressive acts which show the spanish and french belligerence to working on a meaningful peace process in the basque country
6410881 the country wants a democratic president theyre not sure they want this democrat
6410882 look whats happened in the last six to eight weeks six to eight weeks ago the question wasnt whether obama would win but by how much
6410883 anything that raises the level of international tension may not be good for the us but its likely to benefit sen mccains chances

6410902 the settlers try to frighten people and make them leave
6410903 the israeli authorities deny it but with the cameras we can prove what happens and force them to do their jobs
6410904 the idea is to give palestinians the technology and know how to document the reality of their lives thereby exposing human rights violations and the reaction or non reaction of the israeli authorities
6410905 the defence minister called it a very serious and unusual incident
6410906 but btselems point is that this is not unusual mistreatment of detainees is very common
6410907 its unlikely they will be able to get a prosecution and conviction on the basis of this footage but it was clear that public pressure spurred the police to act

6410910 still its our most effective weapon a way of peaceful resistance
6410911 before the intifada we were allowed to use about 80 percent of our land
6410912 irregular warfare the nonkinetic solutions some whole of government approaches but particularly looking at the notion of information dominance in the battle space and things that we can do with our interagency partners to achieve effects without necessarily totally leaning on
6410913 this is a very long term strategy that we must be engaged in and it runs the gamut from just counter terrorism to counter crime to however you want to look at it
6410914 threads of violent actors that range across the scope of terrorist actors to just international organized criminals to i think narco terrorists or drug traders and then in some cases just basic gangs thieves and thugs that can come together and represent a very formidable threat to our region for a number of reasons
6410915 these are not necessarily you know standing organized armies that wear uniforms like we all envision warfare to be
6410916 it takes a different kind of tactic in terms of countering disrupting and defeating this kind of threat
6410917 if were going to establish a security line of operation in afghanistan then obviously from that you dont necessarily get security if you cant resolve the economic and agricultural conundrum of what is the money maker well its the poppy product so a strategy has got to deal with that
6410918 what do we do the military does not necessarily do that but what can we do to establish desired strategic objectives that the interagency could step up to with maybe department of agriculture us agency for international development and state department to do that what can nato do to also help influence that
6410919 afghanistan is a different battle space than iraq so the lessons of iraq may or may not work in afghanistan
6410920 the situation is much different the people are much different the dynamics are much different so still a lot of work to be done in afghanistan
6410921 long term endeavor to engage at a strategic level to do those things across all of the many areas of need that would need to be done

6410991 the northern territorys police commissioner has revealed that no evidence has been found to substantiate allegations of sexual abuse in the communities of mutijulu or nhulunbuy
6410992 but predominantly im talking around 12 13 14 years of age now theyve learned that somehow that seems to be a lot of the work of the child abuse task force and we probably see more of that than we see of adult child sex abuse
6410993 we know of instances where sexualised behaviour has occurred in young kids under the age of 10 years
6410994 i think thats probably where theres going to be an issue because night patrol isnt going to be able to grab these people and restrain them maybe police will be able to use these facilities i really dont know
6410995 although this relates to areas other than the film industry the point is valid until the ranks of leadership in every industry reflect the diversity of the country and especially the diversity of college and professional grads there is something other than meritocracy defining who gets the top jobs the question is are the underprivileged unconsciously colluding with the privileged in buying into their formulas for success big house fancy car etc in other words employing the same toys to designate power do powerful women need to create their own power symbols and offer a different perspective on how power can express itself
6410996 change begins with protest but expands by taking initiatives to create change another point to add why dont women create their own list of the top women in hollywood and put up their own list of criteria for being at the top maybe begin by holding a debate among women leaders themselves as to what criteria should be used as long as women surrender to men the power to anoint them with recognition they reinforce mens stature as the judges of and power givers to women

6411246 we need to relieve the burden on the va from routine health care
6411247 if you have a routine health care need take it wherever you want whatever doctor or health care provider and get the treatment you need while we at the va focus our attention our care our love on these grievous wounds of war
6411248 received consistently better care across the board including screening diagnosis treatment and follow up
6411249 ideologues like john mccain and george bush hate the fact that the va exists
6411250 they hate the fact that theres a functional example out there of the government providing better care at a lower cost than the private sector

6411253 if mccain would work to properly fund va care there would be no issue about a va card
6411254 mccain by wanting to give vets private care is walking away from the va and ignoring the problem
6411255 for every vet who would get a va card that would be one less vet using the va
6411256 would mean in a short period of time a smaller budget fewer locations and the eventual dismantling of the best health care system in the country
6411257 its completely absurd its character assassination its disgraceful from top to bottom how do you respond to this kind of gutter snipe politics
6411258 seemed to be calibrating policy in a way that happened to benefit ultimately himself and special interests

6411348 sixty million indigenous peoples are dependent on forests for their livelihoods food and medicines
6411349 these people have already been severely impacted by deforestation if the value of their forests increases governments and corporations may be willing to go to extreme lengths to wrest forests away from indigenous peoples and others
6411350 delegates are focusing on finance but to stop deforestation land rights must be centre stage these un climate talks shamefully continue to take place without any meaningful participation by indigenous peoples
6411351 the us could say that it will only join a post kyoto agreement on condition that they it can offset emissions by buying deforestation credits it would be a catastrophe
6411352 it could crash the price of carbon and would mean the reduction of pollution in rich countries would be come quite uneconomic

6411399 theres no indication that customers dont feel its a value added service
6411400 in the u s weve already positioned that as a free service to the customer

6411441 the government is clear that it will not be seeking an early election at any time parliament can defeat the government and provoke an early election if that is what the opposition irresponsibly chooses to do
6411442 if parliament was not functioning well that would show a lack of confidence in the government its a no brainer that wed have to go to the people to try and settle it
6411443 im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively

6411473 the first year i had a little bit of a rough start it the professional game is a lot different than the college game the length of the season and the style of play obviously the level of play is better i would have liked to do better than i did in utah but since i have come to cincinnati i think things have gone well its been a lot of fun here and im really enjoying it
6411474 just having a little more experience will go a long ways towards that
6411475 ive gotten more opportunities to play and have been put in more offensive situations in games with some good offensive players we had a good offensive team this season and had a lot of guys who could put the puck in the net no matter who you played with on any given night there was a pretty good chance you were going to get in on a goal somewhere along the line

6411607 while dick cheney has been talking tough over the years about irans alleged nuclear activities the vice president has been quietly pursuing nuclear ambitions of his own for more than two years cheney and a relatively unknown administration official deputy energy secretary clay sell have been regularly visiting the nuclear regulatory commission nrc to ensure agency officials rewrite regulatory policies and bypass public hearings in order to streamline the licensing process for energy companies that have filed applications to build new nuclear power reactors as well as applications for new nuclear facilities that are expected to be filed by other companies in the months ahead longtime nrc officials said the energy corporations cheney and sell have been personally lobbying the nrc on behalf of this year have advised the vice president and his staff on energy policy in a way that would boost their companies profit margins these corporations have also donated millions of dollars to president bushs and cheneys past presidential campaigns at a time when public awareness surrounding renewable energy resources the devastating effects of global warming and the importance of conservation is at an all time high the bush administration has steered tens of billions in taxpayer dollars toward revamping the dormant nuclear power industry touting it as the only proven technology to combat climate change behind the scenes cheney and sell have worked in tandem with the nuclear energy institute nei cheney and sells behind the scenes efforts have been a boon for the nuclear energy industry and to westinghouse electric a nuclear reactor designer whose ap1000 reactor unit was certified by the department of energy the company stands to earn tens of billions of dollars in profit through the sale of just a few of its nuclear reactor units cheney has said publicly he wants to see dozens scattered across the us nrg chief executive david crane told investors recently that massive federal tax incentives and federal loan guarantees included in the energy policy act of 2005 was the deciding factor in steering the company toward the 6 billion nuclear project the whole reason we started down this path was the benefits written into the energy policy act of 2005 crane said the federal loan program automatically requires taxpayers to cover any defaults on the loans in a february report to congress the government accountability office said failure to properly account for default risks in the loan program was one factor that could result in substantial financial costs to the taxpayer a 2003 congressional budget office cbo report said the risk of utilities defaulting on loans for new nuclear plants is very high well above 50 percent perhaps the thorniest issue neither cheney sell bodman nor the nuclear energy industry has yet to address is how it plans to dispose of nuclear waste in over 50 years of operating experience the nuclear industry still has not managed to solve the problems of safety security and disposal of highly dangerous radioactive waste said jon block nuclear energy and climate change project manager for the union of concerned scientists ucs until that happens were much better off investing in safer cleaner energy sources such as renewable wind geothermal tidal and solar projects

6412017 weve had the no 4 for a long time and there is a lot of history there
6412018 i think nascar respects the history of morgan mcclure motorsports and i think they made the right decision
6412019 we had some hiccups in the no 4 with larry mcclure
6412020 im not sure there was enough due diligence when it came to knowing for sure if mr mcclure was going to have a car for next year
6412021 we spoke with nascar and nascar said that that number was available and im not sure that all the way around that enough due diligence was done
6412022 weve been told that mcclure is going to run some races next year and to us especially me as a car owner we know how much car numbers mean to teams and organizations
6412023 even though nascar has given us that number for next year if mr mcclure is going to run a car were excited to have him back in the series so we wanted him to have his number

6412107 companies are recognizing a movement afoot but im not sure this sale says much about that
6412108 no one could go in and buy it outright like pacific summit had
6412109 i think i would term this addition through subtraction for monsanto
6412110 did they really need to spend their time defending this product when its not the reason people are buying their stock
6412111 it allows monsanto to focus on its core seeds and traits business

6412235 as far as conviction of casting me all the credit goes to him ram gopal verma i had no idea what he had in his mind due to lot of intensity in the character he casted me and probably wanted me to make the character look real and not very star cast type he has gone on with casting because i guess because he wanted people to just get into the flow of the subject and not the casting
6412236 my character in the film is about a girl who is a complete believer in god somewhere down the line she starts believing in black magic she thinks that as god is power so is black magic which takes one towards the evil but slowly as the film progresses she thinks that practical things like doctors and medicine also exist so my character transforms from a complete believer in god towards an atheist

6412282 but i do think its about time someone took a serious look at this problem
6412283 we stick out like a sore thumb when it comes to having the age limit for bars be 19
6412284 thats a big reason our binge drinking percentage is one of the highest in the nation the lower the drinking age goes the more the problem will trickle down to younger and younger people its a hard problem to solve

6412296 the strategy for pet packaging of focusing on the higher growth custom containers segment where it has a strong market position supported by industry leading technology has been correct with returns for the business increasing from 9 2 to 12 per cent over the past two years
6412297 the business has made substantial progress in recovering these increases via contractual pass throughs

6412302 with these words the board of directors asks the annual general meeting for a mandate to close the sale of danisco sugar to german based nordzucker
6412303 if the annual general meeting rejects the proposal the board of directors will consider it a mandate to work towards an independent stock exchange listing or other alternatives
6412304 we are working hard to become a market driven organisation through and through by for example optimising and motivating our sales force so that danisco is at the top of relevant customers minds we want to be the company with the strongest innovation team the innovative company which others want to cooperate with and finally we want to be leading in sustainable production and products
6412305 we already have products in all those areas today but we want to be among the three largest and best in the world this requires an effort and could also involve acquisitions we are determined to be in the top three because we know that it is a market with solid growth rates
6412306 dupont has the expertise we dont have and we have what dupont doesnt have together we form a partnership that will end up in a sustainable product based on residue from for instance agriculture or forestry
6412307 each party is initially investing up to dkk 350 million over the next three years that is a lot of money but just listen to this we foresee a market for second generation bioethanol of at least usd 75 billion in 2020 corresponding to around dkk 400 billion

6412317 it teaches you a lot of humility thats for sure
6412318 being 1 11 and the disrespect that you feel because you havent earned any respect it motivates you and helps you become a better team
6412319 we really feel like that we added some football players that are going to help our football team become more dynamic
6412320 i dont think anybody has really solidified anything we have good competition there and thats good the whole group is doing a lot of things better but were not ready to play yet
6412321 were probably in a holding pattern right now right now its still jake but its a competition
6412322 obviously its been pretty well documented that i didnt play as well as i should have last year
6412323 theres nothing wrong with that it was a learning experience and i think it made me that much better
6412324 i have no doubts in my ability or where i stand or what i can get done on the field just like the other guys have no doubts on what they can do
6412325 ferentz always stresses to us that its an open competition and that no one should be relaxing because like i said earlier thats a cancer if you relax the next thing you know were getting worse
6412326 hes pushed jake to the hill especially coming out of spring ball those guys were virtually neck and neck
6412327 im confident in all of these guys the guy that we put on the field is the guy that we feel gives us the best chance to win
6412328 im sure he thinks hes the guy and you know i think im the guy
6412329 thats not really up to us all we do is practice and do as well as we can im not really thinking about that im just trying to get better
6412330 the beauty of the music is its repetitive but you dont know its repetitive
6412331 this music flows and its like breathing its like eating a good meal
6412332 we definitely cater the type and sound of our music to whom we think were going to be playing in front of
6412333 we did the things that were important to us i e functioning bathrooms
6412334 its funny because some people notice and some people dont
6412335 but it was also kind of broken and slanted not the safest when youre trying to get up from a bench on a hill at 1 30 drunk
6412336 i think we did a pretty dern good job gutting the place and cleaning up
6412337 i had been doing shows at gabes for years and i had met so many wonderful people in iowa city over the years that it was kind of my second home
6412338 so when we had the chance to take it over i decided we should give it a try so we did
6412339 sometimes people stay all day sometimes just an hour some meet people here or they come by themselves we have husbands and wives come in we have one couple who always come with their baby
6412340 well see sometimes 15 people on a saturday if not more going in and out just setting aside some time to knit and eat
6412341 we both like fiber arts in general and we knew a lot of people interested in that we wanted to make a place for the community where you could meet other people knitting and sewing buy materials and also make things in our space
6412342 the best thing about the business for me is meeting the people who come in here and seeing what theyre doing and learning from them
6412343 sometimes people kind of know how to do things but sometimes theyll need help with a step in a pattern
6412344 sometimes ill hear people say they cant knit around their children
6412345 yeah i think at this point he is but im really happy about paki
6412346 he works hard he hustles been doing a lot of good things there so those guys are running no 1 and no 2 well see what happens after that

6412358 joachim l w wie bewerten sie das 2 0 gegen belgien
6412359 das 2 0 war verdient das ergebnis ist aber zweitrangig ich wollte sehen dass die mannschaft versucht zu kombinieren dass die spielaufl sung gut ist und wir im fluss sind das hat sie sehr gut umgesetzt wir haben den gegner beherrscht in der ersten halbzeit hat nur ein tor gefehlt f r diese fr he phase der saison sind wir aber sehr positiv aufgetreten das war ein gutes warm up f r die wm qualifikation
6412360 wie sch tzen sie das deb t von serdar tasci ein
6412361 f r das erste l nderspiel hat er seine sache wirklich gut gemacht die dinge die ich gefordert habe hat er gut gel st serdar hat taktisch gut gespielt und war stark im zweikampf aber nat rlich haben ihn die belgier auch nicht ganz so gefordert
6412362 ist das innenverteidiger duo tasci und heiko westermann eine alternative zu christoph metzelder und per mertesacker
6412363 die innenverteidigung bei der em war nicht so stark und pr sent wie bei der wm da gab es abstimmungsprobleme wir brauchen daher alternativen weshalb es wichtig war tasci und westermann zu sehen sie haben die sache konsequent umgesetzt ich bin froh ber die alternativen
6412364 in michael ballack und torsten frings mussten sie zwei wichtige spieler ersetzen wie beurteilen sie die leistung von thomas hitzlsperger und simon rolfes
6412365 wir wissen was wir an michael und torsten haben aber ich m chte den konkurrenzkampf haben ich bin froh ber die gute leistung von thomas hitzlsperger und simon rolfes denn das gibt den spielern selbstvertrauen dar ber kann ich als trainer nur froh sein
6412366 das ist ein gesundes selbstbewusstsein er ist schon l nger dabei und sein ziel ist es einfach stammspieler zu werden das ist legitim
6412367 bastian schweinsteiger war gegen belgien in der zweiten h lfte zum ersten mal kapit n und verwandelte den wichtigen elfmeter zum 1 0 kann er der kommende f hrungsspieler werden
6412368 bastian hat bei der em besonders nach dem portugal spiel an selbstevertrauen gewonnen er muss jetzt immer mehr in die verantwortung hineinwachsen um dann eine f hrungsrolle bernehmen zu k nnen
6412369 erneut hat kein st rmer ein tor erzielt bereitet ihnen das sorgen f r die wm qualifikation
6412370 a lot of people in iowa city wanted a big film festival for a long time

6412425 after five plus years of criticizing amds direct connect architecture our competition has effectively ratified it by developing a technology based on the core fundamentals of our design
6412426 amd is always skating to where the puck will be to borrow a phrase from wayne gretzky nine years ago we saw that efficient processor architecture was what customers needed and we led the industry there now intel is finally arriving to the architecture game late and weve moved on to delivering a truly superior balanced platform with todays leading graphics technologies like the 790gx and the ati radeon hd 4870 x2 and our industry leading processor architectures amd is delivering computing solutions today that are designed for tomorrows graphics intensive workloads while intel is sprinting just to implement technologies like we introduced in 2003 our focus is squarely on execution weve got the strongest products weve ever had and we believe our offerings will only get better in 2h 08
6412427 when considering something like intels larrabee their attempt at entering the graphics market it is important to remember product blunders like itanium and xscale in that context larrabee makes perfect sense as intels proposed graphics solution when all you can do is x86 processors then everything looks like a problem that can be solved by x86 processing cores unfortunately early analysis by industry experts point to larrabee being too hot and too slow to be an effective graphics solution

6412501 a police lawyer called me yesterday tuesday and said that the police simply dont have the manpower for the job theyre afraid of riots and soon u s secretary of state condoleeza rice is coming to the region and soon it will be ramadan etc etc but she promised over and over that for sure before the high holidays nearly six weeks from now ed they will do it
6412502 the eviction is a very sensitive on behalf of a jew living in hevron sic he actually lives in kiryat arba ed and the property is located in an arab neighborhood it should also be noted that the eviction was set for approximately a week before the onset of the ramadan month in my estimation the police deployment for the eviction will be very intensive because of the expectation of riots after the eviction and it will lead into the ramadan fasts similarly it will involve the deployment of many policemen on the day on which u s secretary rice is expected which will make it very difficult based on this we ask for a flexible eviction order beginning from oct 5 2008 until feb 1 2009
6412503 but they even want to put it off for several months and how can the police lawyer make a promise to golbert that they will do it before rosh hashanah when the days before rosh hashanah are still in the month of ramadan how can i believe them
6412504 most unfortunately no if the police explain that they cant carry it out then the court will believe them and thats that
6412505 they have made this into a soap opera and a circus i would like to believe them when they say they will do it in a month but its very hard for me to do so because of how they have stalled and pushed this off so many times in the past and because of what they are promising now
6412506 i have interests here but the jewish people have an even greater interest in this case if the courts do not enforce this order it is very likely that this entire area will simply become arab when you lose the ability to enforce the law you lose sovereignty and the jewish people are in danger of having that happen right here in jerusalem
6412507 i intend to warn the cabinet ministers on the danger inherent in approving the budget
6412508 i hope the ministers will not raise their hands in favor of the proposal because it will cause a layoff of workers and instability in the economy

6412510 if the enemy continues with its stubborn attitude gilad shalit will become a second ron arad
6412511 abbas and fayyad do not want the resistance to achieve a respectable deal as they do not believe in the way of resistance they only believe in the way of negotiations and begging to the enemy and succeed only in releasing prisoners who were anyway approaching their release date
6412512 we received a personal request in the matter from the king who is one of my friends this move was considered very carefully we are not releasing these prisoners we are remanding them to a jordanian prison for the rest of their sentence
6412513 not be alarmed about handling daily stressors during pregnancy a developing fetus requires some exposure to maternal stress as it normalizes their stress functioning but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems
6412514 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6412515 confirms previous reports of an excess incidence of schizophrenia in offspring born to mothers who experienced stress in early pregnancy
6412516 suggests a relatively narrow window of vulnerability in the second month it deserves to be replicated in a larger sample
6412517 even if the increased risk of schizophrenia is a few times higher it is still very low it can still mean a small minority women should not be frightened severe stress in pregnant women during the yom kippur war the lebanon wars and the intifada should also be studied to see if there is support for their hypothesis
6412518 the study is important the authors are clearly on to something but what is really still missing is a subjective perception of the stress by the mothers
6412519 one of the most important effects of stress trauma happens when the person experiences severe helplessness and horror the study therefore as the authors suggest creates a hypothesis but not proof this is an interesting direction but the evidence so far is not very convincing evidence
6412520 although they state that mothers should not be worried i think that their article creates too much anxiety and possibly guilt feelings in parents without a stable basis for it

6412536 the apa report in fact does draw a very strong and dogmatic conclusion that cannot be defended on the basis of evidence since this evidence is lacking by the admission of the report
6412537 what the committee has in effect said is that until there is compelling evidence to the contrary people should act as though abortion has no harmful effects
6412538 this is not a defensible position in a situation in which there is evidence pointing in the direction of harmful effects

6412562 weve gone with the status quo regarding fluoride for too long and now we need to take a fresh look in the scientific community people tend to think that fluoridation is settled but when we looked at the studies that have been done we found that many of these questions are unsettled and we have much less information than we should considering how long this fluoridation has been going on in the face of ignorance controversy is rampant
6412563 some recent studies suggest that over consumption of fluoride can raise the risks of disorders affecting teeth bones the brain and the thyroid gland
6412564 fluoride the most consumed drug in the usa is deliberately added to 2 3 of public water supplies theoretically to reduce tooth decay but with no scientifically valid evidence proving safety or effectiveness
6412565 there is no universally accepted optimal level for daily intake of fluoride
6412566 concluded that fluoride can subtly alter endocrine function especially in the thyroid the gland that produces hormones regulating growth and metabolism
6412567 a series of epidemiological studies in china have associated high fluoride exposures with lower iq
6412568 e pidemiological studies and tests on lab animals suggest that high fluoride exposure increases the risk of bone fracture especially in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and diabetics
6412569 iowa children who lived in communities where the water was fluoridated were 50 percent more likely to have mild fluorosis than nine year old children living in nonfluoridated areas of the state
6412570 g enetic environmental and even cultural factors appear to leave some people much more susceptible to the effects of fluoride
6412571 what the nrc committee found is that weve gone with the status quo regarding fluoride for too long and now we need to take a fresh look
6412572 in the scientific community people tend to think that its settled but when we looked at the studies that have been done we found that many of these questions are unsettled and we have much less information than we should considering how long this fluoridation has been going on i think thats why fluoridation is still being challenged so many years after it began in the face of ignorance controversy is rampant
6412573 when the supreme court interferes in an issue that is mainly political its a drawback
6412574 its a disincentive to insurgents to stop fighting and come back to the negotiating table
6412575 we consider these groups just plain criminals because they have defied the orders of milf leadership

6412603 ayckbourn has created in very human terms a description of how capricious fate is
6412604 its a dazzling tour de force for great comedic actors and a hilarious description of our chaotic universe it is one of ayckbourns greatest plays and speaks to us vividly about a lack of emotional and spiritual compass that most of us experience today
6412605 the female character makes a decision in the first few lines of the play and from that two quite different scenes develop the play is about those tiny decisions we all make in our lives that lead to bigger consequences its a huge concept and is very difficult as there are just two actors playing a total of ten roles all the characters are very different and it is a feat of memory for the actors to learn about 16 to 17 hours worth of dialogue after a production like this you dont have a nerve in your body because it cant get any worse
6412606 its a great challenge for the director and actors because it needs to move speedily and with nuance

6412626 obama is pivoting toward a more combative style rebuking the republicans for habitually turning differences over policy into questions about patriotism a habit he said john mccain has readily embraced
6412627 yet the mccain campaign continues to run ads attacking obama on a personal level belittling him as a shallow celebrity and describing him as fussy hysterical or testy and while obamas been fighting back lately our poll found a majority believes mccain spends more time attacking obama 52 than explaining what he would do as president 38
6412628 with the race getting closer theres a sense that whatever voters may think about it
6412629 when she heard that rospars was working for obama albright hanna called and said she wanted to produce a doc on obama the campaign planned to develop its own video content rospars said intrigued albright hanna sent him a proposal on video strategy weeks later she left cnn and moved with her husband and 3 year old son to chicago
6412630 simply dont find it plausible the president of the united states could have an affair with an intern
6412631 all of this raises the question of what will happen to the deficit obamas aides optimistically insist he will reduce it thanks to his tax increases on the affluent and his plan to wind down the iraq war relative to mccain whose promised spending cuts are extremely vague obama does indeed look like a fiscal conservative
6412632 at this point i think they need hillary clinton ive been thinking this way a long time not just because its bold and they need to show bold but you know what i think they need the clinton ruthlessness onboard i really do im beginning to think bill clinton is still the only guy in that party who really knows how to do this as far as talking to the american people making the counter argument to the republican arguments that again obama just seems to be cozying up to their way of thinking
6412633 moving to the center moving to be a kind of a lighter version of the republican candidate
6412634 you know there are some people who feel that this is kind of a sham operation that really we know you as an evangelical are a republican a john mccain supporter
6412635 obama is pivoting toward a more combative style rebuking the republicans for habitually turning differences over policy into questions about patriotism a habit he said john mccain has readily embraced

6412642 simply dont find it plausible the president of the united states could have an affair with an intern
6412643 will join barack obamas presidential campaign as a senior strategist and as a senior campaign spokesperson on the roadshow a newly created position
6412644 douglass confirmed her new position when i walked up to the ninth floor knocked on her door and asked her about it
6412645 she grew disillusioned with the partisanship she saw first hand
6412646 obamas wide web from youtube to text messaging candidates team connects to voters
6412647 early on we wanted to capture the sense that this campaign is not just about obama
6412648 i like how obama always says blacks whites spanish asian
6412649 he says all the races so you can see that hes not focused on one group of people
6412650 i guess ive kind of been rebelling from my cnn days where video had to be a certain length a certain format with a certain sensibility where i came from theres a lot of concern about ratings and about what they think people everyday people are interested in watching
6412651 here we dont worry about how many views our videos get thats not the priority one of our goals is to get people talking about whats going on in their lives and why theyre supporting barack and hopefully not only will they watch the videos but also comment on them and forward them to relatives and friends and co workers
6412652 all of this raises the question of what will happen to the deficit obamas aides optimistically insist he will reduce it thanks to his tax increases on the affluent and his plan to wind down the iraq war relative to mccain whose promised spending cuts are extremely vague obama does indeed look like a fiscal conservative
6412653 laissez faire capitalism hasnt delivered nearly what its proponents promised it has created big budget deficits the most pronounced income inequality since the 1920s and the current financial crisis
6412654 todays democratic consensus has moved the party to the left
6412655 at this point i think they need hillary clinton ive been thinking this way a long time not just because its bold and they need to show bold but you know what i think they need the clinton ruthlessness onboard i really do im beginning to think bill clinton is still the only guy in that party who really knows how to do this as far as talking to the american people making the counter argument to the republican arguments that again obama just seems to be cozying up to their way of thinking
6412656 moving to the center moving to be a kind of a lighter version of the republican candidate
6412657 you know im reading i guess the same thing youre reading that its between three boring white guys again
6412658 actually if he doubled down on colin powell how wild would that be i mean this is the democrats problem is that they never do anything bold once they get the nomination you know im still for obama but i have to tell you hes trying my patience
6412659 well moving to the center on so many issues and just doing what i saw kerry do what i saw al gore do i thought he was going to be different he didnt have that im going to blow it look on his face like those two did but hes doing sort of the same thing moving to the center moving to be a kind of a lighter version of the republican candidate
6412660 you know there are some people who feel that this is kind of a sham operation that really we know you as an evangelical are a republican a john mccain supporter
6412661 but do you feel like at some point rick you owe the people who look to you for guidance more than that
6412662 so if someone were to come to you and say you know what forget character im going to vote for the guy who is opposed to abortion would you say they need to go back and think a little harder
6412663 no i would say you made your hierarchy of values and for you the value of preserving life is the top value great good decision
6412664 could you vote for either one of them thats a different question than saying who would you vote for
6412665 the wink seems to say mccain but rick warren is too savvy to speak the name determined to keep the public dialogue going with his two very powerful friends
6412666 well i totally disavow liberation theology and black liberation theology i think theyre both wrong i think they are radical i think theyre marxism in christian terms and i think theyre dead wrong
6412667 so what does it say about barack obama that that was his church for so many years
6412668 theres a difference between a personal connection and a political connection
6412669 id say then barack youre a lot more liberal than youre letting us on to be youre a lot more radical than youre letting us on to be
6412670 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this
6412671 to say theyre not bothering anyone or doing anything wrong is a misnomer
6412672 do i think homeless people are bad no but theyre here because its easy and because we werent enforcing public order crimes weve received a mandate from the citizens to clean up the city and take back the neighborhoods so here we go
6412673 the ones that were usually out here giving us problems are in jail right now
6412674 i cant rest i understand some of it i dont like people begging me if youre not bothering nobody why do you have to move where do you want me to go
6412675 its too early in the litigation to specify an amount
6412676 he had no insurance and was riding around in a private vehicle with the logo of a pizza place on top of the vehicle
6412677 honestly i dont see how this has much to do with your election
6412678 the bottom line is they had sold these coffins to people and they were imitations of an american made casket and so they got a restraining order to stop doing that
6412679 should have been aware of this going on and here hes actively marketing foreign products undermining american made products
6412680 the product the chinese are offering us now its a quality product
6412681 you put a chinese casket next to a york casket or one of these other manufacturers you cant tell the difference
6412682 sought the endorsement of local labor unions for financial support and votes in the november general election
6412683 needs to fess up to his union supporters about his participation in exporting american jobs to china
6412684 libelous containing many misstatements of fact and stating conclusions that are meant to do nothing but maliciously harm crowder funeral homes
6412685 just may be the most powerful woman in chicago besides oprah
6412686 to look now at some of john mccains tv and web ads it is almost as if his campaign is following penns outsider strategy to the letter
6412687 now it frequently seems respect takes a backseat to ridicule
6412688 mccain advertisements are much more likely to be contrast or negative and the obama advertisements are much more likely to be positive
6412689 i will let no one question my love of this country

6412692 hearing a lot of messages from all across the country that he has not been tough enough he has to go after john mccain hes got to be more aggressive
6412693 it occurs to me that john mccain is as intellectually shallow as our current president
6412694 bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been
6412695 i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him
6412696 he showed the same intellectual curiosity that george bush has virtually none
6412697 throughout the evening mccain chose to recite portions of his stump speech as answers to the questions he was being asked why he has lived 71 years surely he has some thoughts on what it all means that go beyond canned answers culled from the same speech he delivers every day

6412705 obama strongly defended his patriotism today to veterans the same group that heard john mccain attack him yesterday
6412706 hearing a lot of messages from all across the country that he has not been tough enough he has to go after john mccain hes got to be more aggressive
6412707 could wait until the republican convention to distract attention from george bush and dick cheney the first nights speakers
6412708 its a message of independence it brings back the maverick john mccain it solidifies his image with independent voters
6412709 had the stage to themselves last week while obama vacationed
6412710 obama put out a tongue in cheek response to senator mccains celebrity ad
6412711 the ad also features six different shots of senator mccain next to president bush
6412712 now it frequently seems respect takes a backseat to ridicule
6412713 mccains web site is still playing catch up to obamas use of cyberspace
6412714 youve got better things to do im not the guy
6412715 it occurs to me that john mccain is as intellectually shallow as our current president
6412716 bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been

6412720 unless hes reciting talking points or reading from notes or a teleprompter john mccain is lost he can drop bon mots at a bowling alley or diner short glib responses that get a chuckle but beyond that mccain gets in over his head very quickly i am sick and tired of the president of the united states embarrassing me

6412736 a provision makes clear that it does not affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion obamas campaign points out that that added provision in that 2005 bill was a measure he had wanted in the past
6412737 well 2003 the national right to life committee will say the language is very similar but what the obama camp pointed out is that it lacked a provision to protect roe v wade that was the measure that was added two years later so that is the explanation why the campaign said and obama has said that he opposed that 2003 law
6412738 said the federal version he supported was not the bill that was presented at the state level
6412739 acknowledged that he had voted against an identical bill in the state senate and a spokesman hari sevugan said the senator and other lawmakers had concerns that even as worded the legislation could have undermined existing illinois abortion law

6412894 we have a great sensitivity about returning vets especially those that have been wounded and have been through a very difficult time and wed like to do our part
6412895 so the situation occurred as to what can we do to help ourselves and help others
6412896 we also have a construction and modernization company that would enable us to take the plans and specifications that are given by the va to folks like us and modify the houses to specific plans for these returning vets
6412897 so we put a program together and developed a flier which was all submitted to the va in washington d c and they loved the idea
6412898 we are prepared to sell the vets the houses at below current appraisal and then we have the ability to do one stop shopping to modify the house for the vets so it would take any of their physical challenges and make them more comfortable living in that type of environment
6412899 we would either take it off the market or we would say ok we would give the vet and va first right of refusal on any of the inventory
6412900 i believe the potential will be further strengthened in future
6412901 dat heeft alles te maken met onze financi le beperkingen trek je rookies aan die het vervolgens goed doen dan zijn ze het jaar erop meteen een stuk duurder een ander aspect is dat we het hebben geprobeerd met n gelouterde prof in het team tyler smith d t is wat aan de magere kant gebleken met spelers als erik nelson ryan sears en gerrit brigitha hebben we nu voor m r senioriteit gekozen gerrit vindt dat hij wat heeft goed te maken we verwachten veel van hem
6412902 hij wordt dit jaar wellicht onze troef een plek in het startende vijftal zit er zeker in ik heb hem tijdens de eerste training in actie gezien zijn agent had al over zijn lengte en die van zijn armen verteld nu blijkt het daadwerkelijk te kloppen mickell komt met zijn handen cht 70 centimeter boven de ring uit ongelooflijk tel daar gerrit en erik bij op en je hebt een sterke inside rotatie die van alle markten thuis is die twee hebben zelfs een aardig schot
6412903 dat heeft alles te maken met de door matrixx magixx gehanteerde speelwijze todd heeft het fantastisch gedaan zich sterk ontwikkeld maar wij blijven een fast break ploeg vandaar dat we ryan sears hebben teruggehaald hij passt sneller wat dat betreft verloopt het volgens plan ryan stond samen met darnell wilson bovenaan ons lijstje
6412904 darnell kan als small en power forward spelen raoul als twee drie en zelfs als n we hebben nu drie spelverdelers die eerst aan het team denken iedereen die niet in de bucket speelt heeft een goed schot ik vind de selectie veel dieper en sterker dan vorig jaar we willen er alleen nog een shooting guard bij die screens kan gebruiken en makkelijk schiet kortom iemand die kan afdrukken
6412905 we kunnen nu inderdaad ook groot spelen en zijn meer in balans al heb je nog zo weinig geld je probeert altijd een team samen te stellen waarmee je kampioen kunt worden ook vorig jaar frans steyn hadden we speciaal voor de tweede seizoenshelft gepland juist om myguide amsterdam beter het hoofd te kunnen bieden in september 2007 had ik al contact met ziijn agent het verhaal is bekend hij moest het land uit mchugh mattis was geblesseerd en uiteindelijk hebben we het ook nog eens zonder tyler smith moeten stellen d n lukt het inderdaad niet
6412906 om die reden hebben we andere beslissingen genomen die hebben er onder meer toe geleid dat nu lle dragende spelers mannen zijn die door de pijn heen kunnen spelen de hardste van allemaal is natuurlijk erik nelson hij wilde vorig jaar al graag bij ons komen maar is toen naar de vermont frost heaves gegaan zijn prijs was voor ons te hoog maar we hebben altijd contact met elkaar gehouden nu is hij met zijn hele gezin terug in nederland van tyler wisten we al dat hij zou vertrekken nu beschikken we t ch over de onverzettelijke man waar het team in barre tijden op kan leunen
6412907 het liefst maak je weer een stunt maar de kans daarop is enorm klein de schutter die we gaan aantrekken zal hoogwaarschijnlijk een zeer getalenteerde amerikaan zijn die net van college komt morgen valt daarover de beslissing is het team rond dan gaan we meteen weer door naar het volgende seizoen we zijn een jonge club en hebben nog altijd veel zelf te regelen we willen minstens 1 000 seizoenkaarthouders in de horstacker en de businessclub kan nog doorgroeien ik denk dat we de volgende gr te spong voorwaarts maken als de nieuwe hal in nijmegen een feit is ook al doen we het beter dan verwacht we blijven stap voor stap groeien matrixx magixx moet een blijvend iets zijn voor de fans basketballend nederland n nijmegen

6412934 we would sell 10 boxes containing 10 fruits a fortnight
6412935 now we have done a deal with a vietnamese co operative and our first order of 1 260 boxes containing 10 fruits each sold within a day it was really fantastic

6412939 when the supreme court interferes in an issue that is mainly political its a drawback
6412940 its a disincentive to insurgents to stop fighting and come back to the negotiating table
6412941 we consider these groups just plain criminals because they have defied the orders of milf leadership

6412947 individually most politicians have a deep understanding of the plight of our health care system
6412948 collectively especially at the federal level they are reluctant even afraid of engaging in a meaningful public policy discussion on health for example
6412949 despite the best efforts of medical schools to expand we have actually dropped further in the oecd rankings this year

6413071 adam brings to the position deep familarity with the st
6413072 when we recently asked adam to lead our coverage of the anheuser busch saga he swiftly organized an expanded team of business and metro reporters and editors and helped them identify and execute a series of smart enterprise stories while also keeping on top of breaking developments the resulting coverage distinguished us as a leading source on this important story

6413075 but from an architectural perspective we were very keen to end up with a building that had some connection with water
6413076 that would not have been a very fruitful thing to do to advance ones career
6413077 but that proof relied on computers it was 300 pages long and used 40 000 lines of custom computer code
6413078 the problem is to show that this is the very best of all possibilities

6413086 his discovery of the functional role of the bumps on the flippers of humpbacks is a wonderful example of how clever scientists pursuing interesting questions in animal locomotion can discover novel structures with practical applications in human technology

6413095 i really believe in high school journalism to give skills whether theyre going into journalism or not that will benefit them when they go to college
6413096 learning how to meet deadlines how to work with other people how to solve problems how to communicate how to present material in a way that will appeal to readers or be effective to get your message across all that is really valuable

6413104 to realize that you are indefinitely going to have to rely on the assistance of other people can be disempowering discouraging
6413105 the children go to school they play with balls they have fun they have access to water i thank god

6413247 as things stand religious groups in our society get a slice of the pie vastly larger than their numbers or merits truly justify the big advantage of an atheist prime minister would be that he or she would see that fact and act accordingly an atheist is not going to have the lingering sense that because someone has chosen to believe one or another ancient dogma he is to be respected and honoured listened to given the publics money to bring up his children in the same beliefs and exempted from some of the laws of the land

6413307 die vielzahl der tarife und sonderaktionen sorgt nicht zwangsl ufig f r mehr wechselbereitschaft beim kunden viele kunden bleiben lieber ihrem anbieter treu als sich mit dem tarifwirrwarr auseinanderzusetzen
6413308 da helfen auch die t glichen call center attacken der tk anbieter nicht weiter um den kunden mit halbseidenen angeboten zu berrumpeln und ihm teure vertr ge aufzuschwatzen das f hrt im endergebnis noch zu einer h heren ver rgerung der verbraucher
6413309 die praxis zeigt dass es vielen tk unternehmen nicht gelingt ihren werbespr chen gerecht zu werden sie schlagen sich anscheinend lieber in ihre kundendienst abteilungen mit den auswirkungen und symptomen schlecht konzipierter produkte und services herum und bet tigen sich in der brandbek mpfung ohne die ursachen wirklich zu beheben
6413310 besonders bei den festnetzanbietern bekommt man zuweilen den eindruck dass sie alles tun um m glichst viele servicevorf lle zu generieren
6413311 all das f hrt schnell zu kundenfrust mitarbeiter sind oftmals nicht in der lage ein problem am telefon zu l sen da sie lediglich f r einfache ausk nfte die so genannten faqs geschult sind und ber keine oder geringe vollmachten verf gen um ein kundenanliegen schnell und unb rokratisch zu l sen
6413312 diese mehrfach kontakte werden dann zum echten problem wenn anfragen ber unterschiedliche eingangskan le nicht einem vorgang zugeordnet werden k nnen diese f higkeit besitzen leider die wenigsten unternehmen zudem gibt es oftmals keine ad quate m glichkeit einfache vorg nge schnell selbst zu erledigen wer es gewohnt ist seine fl ge online zubuchen den telefonischen quick check in bevorzugt und sitzplatzreservieren per sms liebt der hat wenig spa bei den meisten angeboten der telefonfirmen zur selbstadministration per telefon oder im internet
6413313 es spricht einiges daf r dass hnlich wie bei den fluggesellschaften gut gemachte self service angebote auch angenommen werden die anzahl der kundenanfragen sinkt und damit die kunden zufriedenheit steigt
6413314 nach unseren studien sind die datentarife f r die nutzung des mobilen internets ein wesentlicher hemmschuh f r dessen weitere verbreitung studiert man das kleingedruckte vermeintlicher flatrate angebote der betreiber so findet man dort in viele f llen limitierungen im datenvolumen bei deren berschreiten entweder die kosten exponentiell ansteigen oder in anderen f llen die nutzungsbandbreite reduziert wird
6413315 gleiches gilt f r datenverbindungen im ausland bei denen exorbitante kosten entstehen k nnen wenn man beispielsweise im auslandsnetz vergisst die regelm ige synchronisation zu deaktivieren und im rhythmus von f nf minuten f r jede einzelnen verbindungsaufbau kr ftig zur kasse gebeten wird mit einer derartigen preispolitik werden die wachstumsphantasien der netzbetreiber sicherlich nicht aufgehen

6413429 the region is at a serious risk of a major catastrophe due to military nuclear powered and armed ships and submarines entering gulf waters an expert warned yesterday
6413430 it seems like a no brainer make uranium burn stronger hotter and longer in nuclear reactors and youll need less fuel and therell be less waste to deal with when it has been exhausted for decades nuclear operators have done just that but emerging safety and waste disposal issues are raising questions about this approach the latest high efficiency fuel may prove to be unstable in an emergency and so poses a greater risk of leakage of radioactive material into the environment whats more the waste fuel is more radioactive meaning it could prove even more difficult than existing waste to store in underground repositories
6413431 britains most notorious nuclear installation was plunged into crisis last week when vital equipment broke down just as it was recovering from an accident that shut it for two years
6413432 some countries hopping on the nuclear bandwagon have abysmal industrial safety records and corrupt ways that give many pause for thought of the more than 100 nuclear reactors now being built planned or on order about half are in china india and other developing nations argentina brazil and south africa plan to expand existing programs and vietnam thailand egypt and turkey are among the countries considering building their first reactors the concerns are hardly limited to developing countries japans nuclear power industry has yet to recover from revelations five years ago of dozens of cases of false reporting on the inspections of nuclear reactor cracks the swedish operators of a german reactor came under fire last summer for delays in informing the public about a fire at the plant and a potentially disastrous partial breakdown of a bulgarian nuclear plants emergency shutdown mechanism in 2006 went unreported for two months until whistle blowers made it public nuclear transparency will be an even greater problem for countries such as china that have tight government controls on information those who mistrust the current nuclear revival are still haunted by the 1986 meltdown of the chernobyl reactor and the soviet unions attempts to hide the full extent of the catastrophe further back in the collective memory is the partial meltdown at three mile island in pennsylvania in 1979 worries persist that bad habits of the past could reflect on nuclear operational safety in china for instance thousands die annually in the worlds most dangerous coal mines and thousands more in fires explosions and other accidents often blamed on insufficient safety equipment and workers ignoring safety rules chinese state media on saturday reported that nearly 3 800 people died in mine accidents last year while that is about 20 percent less than in 2006 it still leaves chinas mines the worlds deadliest countries with nuclear power are obligated to report all incidents to the iaea but the study said most asian governments vastly underreport industrial accidents to the u n s international labor organization fewer than 1 percent in chinas case separately china and india shared 70th place in the 2006 corruption perceptions index published by the transparency international think tank that ranked 163 nations with the least corrupt first and the most last vietnam occupied the 111th spot and indonesia which like hanoi wants to build a nuclear reactor came in 130th hans holger rogner head of the iaeas planning and economic studies section says he is suspicious when people say the next reactor generation will be safer than the one we have
6413433 authorities in italy are investigating a mafia clan accused of trafficking nuclear waste and trying to make plutonium
6413434 when indonesia recently announced plans to build a nuclear plant in java experts said it was a bad idea yesterday indonesians got another reminder of how potentially bad an idea it could be
6413435 the heavily populated tokai region which experts say is due for a major earthquake within 30 years has experienced at least three super temblors of unimaginable destruction during the past 5 000 years according to a study unlike so called tokai earthquakes that occur every 100 years or so a super earthquake is one that causes dramatic change to the landscape through shifts in the earths crust the envisaged tokai quake whose epicenter would be in the bay of suruga facing shizuoka prefecture has an anticipated 87 percent likelihood of hitting by 2037 according to a government taskforce the team drilled more than 10 meters at eight sites in an area about 2 kilometers east of the hamaoka nuclear power plant
6413436 a decaying russian nuclear dump inside the arctic circle is threatening to catch fire or explode turning it into a dirty bomb that could impact the whole of northern europe including the british isles
6413437 just four of 20 nuclear waste storage sites in russia and ukraine have been secured making the remainder vulnerable to thieves and terrorists

6413451 the song was written by donegal man jody gallagher you could call it an apocalyptic type song which is pretty profound given the weather that weve been having for this time of year

6413455 it was a great place to cut your teeth and learn
6413456 i started to really get into country music and listened to merle haggard a lot the bluebirds were different from the showband scene that i was involved in because showbands tended to cover everything from rock to pop to blues to country whereas with the bluebirds we were essentially a country band
6413457 forming kickin mule was like taking a side ways step and it was great fun and very free and easy i played with some great people in that people like arty and strabanes very own peter ohanlon

6413513 nosso ritmo foi realmente bom especialmente com o timo ele chegou em segundo mas j tinha brigado pelos tr s primeiros lugares no grid na qualifica o
6413514 obviamente ele est terminando sua fase de aprendizado talvez jarno tenha ido um pouco mais lento na hungria mas ele n o reclamou do acerto
6413515 ele estava com o tanque muito cheio na qualifica o e tamb m estava na segunda corrida do motor enquanto timo tinha um novo os dois carros foram competitivos em budapeste o que muito bom para a equipe

6413566 most regions have seen strong growth for the first six months of 2008 which is a great result for the industry given the current economic uncertainties facing the global economy
6413567 the region also had the highest occupancy and average room rates in the world at 75 3 percent and us 180 respectively
6413568 the strength of some currencies against the us dollar notably the euro is presenting a challenge for the hotel industry particularly in europe which is likely to see a downturn in visitor numbers from the us and uk during the remainder of the year the us will continue to benefit from an influx in both european and asian travellers but the positive impact of inbound visitors is unlikely to offset the downward pressure as a result of the weakening economy the middle east looks set for a fifth consecutive year of double digit growth and asia is also well placed to have another strong year
6413569 we had him several years ago and were so pleased with him
6413570 when he explained what his new exhibit was like we said go for it
6413571 i hope this generates interest with the students and professors bring their classes to the exhibit
6413572 the students are more confident with computer software you dont see many exhibits in the area like this
6413573 i want to bring out different types of space not just space away from the earth
6413574 i didnt take anyones word for anything i tested everything myself
6413575 its a hobby you can do 24 hours a day i never get done because i find new ways to use it i still find it fascinating to this day
6413576 the post office got its first computers in 1980 and i wrote general application programs for them

6413578 if you put it together right you cant tell i get it printed on canvas then mount it on foam core i can use my brush and acrylic for trees pen and ink or colored pencil for accent lines and regular pencil for birds
6413579 it gives a striking three dimensional image you cant get with a single media
6413580 from day one we drive it home that students need the tech knowledge regardless of if they plan to go mass or independent
6413581 were driven by what employers in our local market request of graduates
6413582 if its not on your r sum that youre familiar with these programs you wont even get a callback
6413583 when students first see the programs even the adobe ones a lot of them are intimidated
6413584 but even after just a few classes theyre much more comfortable using them
6413585 over 100 kwantlen grads work amongst them in their design marketing and production departments
6413586 a lot of people are self taught in computer programs so they come here to supplement their skills
6413587 i switched from using photoshop to illustrator for my catalogues in the last year
6413588 i dont really know how to use so different from photoshop even though theyre both adobe i need to take the 10 week program to fully learn it
6413589 even though weve been around for a while we still couldnt afford it
6413590 had a lot of excel like formats and offered a lot of things we were already doing except in one program
6413591 we have our own templates that have been working for so long for us already
6413592 julys robust 0 8 percent monthly rise in retail sales should be taken with a pinch of salt given that the official sales data have been unusually volatile over the past few months
6413593 abstracting from this volatility sales appear to have been broadly flat since the start of this year

6413607 all 50 states are impacted by these events and many of these events will be exacerbated by climate change
6413608 our concern is that our nation is not prepared for severe weather or climate change because of declining budgets and lack of attention to these threats over the past few years
6413609 we should improve our ability to respond to severe weather events and prepare for the impacts of climate change that will undoubtedly occur over the next several decades decision makers need information on how climate change will affect their local areas but we are hampered by a lack of funding observations and computing power to provide information at this local level
6413610 making our nation resilient to severe weather and climate change
6413611 given the costs of weather and climate disasters we believe these are wise and critical investments

6413668 dat bestaat in nederland niet dat in een hotel waarin zoveel is ge nvesteerd een jongetje van 27 de tent mag runnen
6413669 we wilden het hier anders doen dan in de meeste hotels we richten ons op de mensen niet op hoe het hoort
6413670 we zijn naar universiteiten door heel china gegaan om intakegesprekken te houden daarbij letten we niet op hoeveel ervaring iemand had maar hoe die persoon in het leven staat hoe je een bord moet vasthouden kun je leren maar een positieve levenshouding moet je hebben
6413671 vooral expats waarschuwden mij dat je in china niet hetzelfde serviceniveau moet nastreven als in hongkong maar waarom niet misschien is dat het voordeel van mijn jonge leeftijd ik denk nog de wereld te kunnen veranderen ik geloof dat je alles kunt bereiken en dat mensen alles kunnen leren misschien dat het hier in china iets meer moeite kost maar ook hier kan dat
6413672 natuurlijk leerden we ze de etiquette van het restaurantwezen en welke wijnen er zijn maar het belangrijkste onderdeel was om ze een probleemoplossende instelling mee te geven niet direct naar de baas gaan maar zelf kijken of je het kunt oplossen want dat kom je hoe dan ook tegen zeker als je net open gaat
6413673 wij leren al van jongs af aan creatief te zijn hier leren ze naar de baas te luisteren en staat het personeel in een rechte rij en buigt

6413682 a plus factor for me is that its going to be a furlong shorter than the ebor and were a pound better off with the three year olds in the race than we would have been at york
6413683 there are a lot more pluses than minuses from my point of view and the horse is in top form so well see how he goes

6413711 gold prices found their old ally credit jitters overnight and had a happy reunion as the dollar lost ground on those jitters
6413712 we suspect that with the dollars advance on hold for now and energy prices moving higher to possibly the 120 mark metals will also push higher in sympathy over the next few days
6413713 in addition we suspect that there will be a good deal of short covering that could also aid the advance

6413736 my father had found a job in a small caf one day he was sitting outside it and he got hit by a stray bullet that killed him
6413737 i saw my friends from school eating fresh bread and rolls and it annoyed me so i decided to become a baker
6413738 when i got my first salary in bosanski samac i bought shoes a jacket a suitcase and a train ticket to sarajevo
6413739 but i didnt know where they lived so i walked round sarajevo for hours before i found their house
6413740 there i started to play for jedinstvo the local club
6413741 i remember we had a friendly match against elik from zenica they were a big club at the time a few days after the game some people from elik asked me to go and play for them but it was never meant to be for me in zenica they had a good team and decided to send me out on loan
6413742 so they asked me because i was eliks reserve to play for them
6413743 even though he was really small a lot smaller than the other kids everybody knew darijo was a great talent
6413744 he was good at handball table tennis and basketball one day he even came home from school and said that his teacher had told him to quit football and focus on basketball
6413745 when he was a kid he had offers from dinamo zagreb zagreb and varteks vara din
6413746 i knew that varteks had a best facility for young players so i told him that best thing for him is to play there
6413747 and your name was so important but the worst thing was that the coaches came and openly demanded money for darijo to stay there luckily he was so talented that when the youth coaches saw him they decided he had to stay
6413748 i always tell darijo that you have to save your money when youre earning it
6413749 theres nothing to save when youre broke the only difference to when he first moved in with milka is that there is now an astroturf pitch just around the corner darijos gift to his home town
6413750 i cant forget how they suffered while they were trying to find money for me during my days at hajduk
6413751 i cant forget that my father had a really really difficult life and i am very proud he can live peacefully now without stress i know its impossible to repay him for everything he has done for me but i have bought him a car and given him enough money to live normally now while he is old its the least i can do
6413752 ive learned that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he or she handles these three things a rainy day lost luggage and tangled christmas tree lights

6413754 det finns mycket kvar att g ra inom elektronisk upphandling
6413755 the mechanic suffered an electric shock after touching the sidepod and steering wheel of the car there was a high frequency ac voltage between these contact points the cause of which has been traced back to the kers control unit and a sporadic capacitive coupling from the high voltage network to the 12 volt network the voltage ran through the wiring of the 12 volt network to the steering wheel and through the carbon chassis back to the control unit
6413756 no as only a small amount of energy can be transferred through this capacitive coupling effect however the energy is sufficient to cause an extremely painful reaction the driver was insulated against the car by his racing overalls and gloves and therefore not in any danger
6413757 it was not possible initially to reproduce the capacitive coupling effect in the car as the problem was caused by a sporadic error in the control unit due to the extremely high frequency of the voltage in the steering wheel the safety mechanisms and data recordings did not pick up on the error in the absence of data all the theoretical possibilities had to be systematically investigated and analysed in tests furthermore the capacitive coupling effect only occurs under certain conditions without the option of driving the kers test car used in jerez again we had to reconstruct these conditions we also had to develop a model to be installed between the steering wheel and sidepod which replicated the characteristics of the human body as an electric transfer element
6413758 in addition to the measures required to tackle the issue at hand the extremely far reaching analysis we conducted also gave rise to other recommendations which are of great value for the development of electric kers systems among the measures arrived at are changes in the design of the control unit to avoid capacitive coupling effects extended monitoring functions for high frequencies and a conductive connection of the chassis components to avoid any electric potential
6413759 we have already handed over this safety analysis complete with measures and recommendations to the fia and will also make our findings available to the other teams at the next meeting of the technical working group

6413763 we are not up there on a daily basis to make sure that the builders make it clear to everybody else
6413764 do they have their funding approved through txdot or through the federal highway administration the answer to that is no
6413765 all they are doing is making a statement that they want to come through there
6413766 does that mean that it supports states not being free to affirm the personhood of infants that survive an abortion procedure apparently
6413767 i have seen those newspaper articles talking about the sheer amount of plastic that is thrown away from water bottles and that is a staggering number
6413768 you know we have more pressing issues right now looking at our air quality bottled water hasnt boiled to the top yet its something that we havent spent a lot of time looking at
6413769 but unfortunately there still is the bottle thats wasted at the end we are throwing them away right now
6413770 but i dont really pay a lot of attention to it

6413774 warwick international hotels president richard chiu feels that dallas is a gateway city and he envisions a heightened international profile for the warwick melrose
6413775 yoons international background combined with his breadth of knowledge of hotel operations will be vital in helping us truly deliver on that
6413776 i may be partial but i think the people i work with at the warwick melrose are world class and i truly enjoy our guests every day
6413777 im looking forward to working with this management team to chart new levels of success
6413778 because we were looking for a reasonably priced hotel in fort lauderdale and this one offered an airport shuttle we tried it ok it wasnt the cleanest place weve stayed at this however was not the
6413779 on arrival we were told that the water to our room was turned off they were having plumbing problems it would be turned on in an hour or two and it was so were on holidays no problem
6413780 at about 2 00 or 3 00 am i was wakened by a loud pounding on our door
6413781 he told my husband that there was a fight in our room and demanded that the door be opened now
6413782 on our way to the airport we mentioned our adventure to another passenger he told us about an incident that we werent even aware of a guest of the hotel whose room was on an upper floor had left his door open amp he was standing on his balcony two fellows seeing his open door decided to rob him the first got knocked out the second came at him and was flipped over the balcony railing cant remember whether he fell on a car or the pavement

6413787 we are hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs to foreign countries already so i cannot imagine why our government would decide to take 44 000 american jobs good jobs and give them to the europeans

6413809 you can feel the difference from the time you arrive at the airport we would like to enhance the arrival experience of our guests and members
6413810 they other resorts in the island dont have what we have here our guests have the option to get away from the hustle and bustle here in boracay
6413811 its a major change in the landscape of los angeles
6413812 this is los angeles and the paparazzi problem is so prevalent here
6413813 you have all the offerings without the hassles of managing a large estate
6413814 wang xiuying is almost blind and disabled what sort of re education through labor can she serve
6413815 but they can also be taken away at any time
6413816 the fact that there were so many undercover police following them it just made them go with the action urgently
6413817 in order to reprocess recycled glass to pas 102 standard approximately 73 kg co2 tonne of media is produced compared to 2 kg co2 tonne of silica sand however when the application benefit is taken into account this work has shown that replacing sand with glass as a filtration media delivers savings which may equate to as much as 1 261 kg co2 tonne annum of media produced resulting in a substantial net environmental benefit these co2 savings arise largely from the superior performance of glass and resultant reduced pump run times
6413818 there is a feeling of chill in the economic air
6413819 affiliate marketing what is affiliate marketing it is simply a form of internet marketing that rewards the affiliates for driving traffic to the advertiser or for other transactions

6413822 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6413823 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6413824 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6413825 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6413826 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted
6413827 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our program
6413828 buy from me i will send you all the customers you want do we take one big burst of advertising to everyone
6413829 you need a business plan in case you need financing and the bank wants one from you
6413830 i dont get this youre making a choice and you expect your co workers to simply accept it because it leads to having a child
6413831 why should anyone from your company give you slack because you are infertile this and the lawsuit that brought up this topic are a joke your personal defects should not allow you to screw over a private business just because you want to have kids
6413832 im not opposed to anyone knowing about it per se but i really dont want to tell anyone else if i tell someone its like an open invitation for them to give me their opinion and i dont need that but i do believe its in my best interest for my bosses to not know about this
6413833 i wonder whether this would have implications for health insurance coverage of these procedures does health insurance typically cover this now i seem to remember about five years ago there was push back from the insurance companies over whether or not infertility was a medical condition
6413834 were trying to get the nerve tissue to integrate with a device to grow into it to form a better connection
6413835 to get long term release we think these multi component systems are the way to go
6413836 we can control the release by combining the materials in different ways and were confident that we can extend the release time further even to 90 days
6413837 just sit back relax and wait for the traffic to start pouring into your website
6413838 obviously im disturbed by the fact that people were hurt and someone died
6413839 at the end of the day there are always going to be mental disorders and people who cause violence for no other reason than the fact that theyre f ked up and lost and all we can do is try to learn from it
6413840 he absolutely adores those kids hes doing it really well
6413841 i tried to be patient i just tried to kick them down the last 100
6413842 i knew if i was patient in the race and played it smarter than yesterday id be ok
6413843 to be honest with you we just moved on as quick as we could and got ready for this race today
6413844 what happened yesterday was over i was mad at myself for a minute and now its on to the final
6413845 bolt set it off after that i just think the jamaican camp went crazy
6413846 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 30s
6413847 oonu just caan accept se sumady from likkle jamaica suh large a china
6413848 negotiators have taken this very very far toward an end agreement
6413849 im not going to dispute that there might be some hillary clinton supporters who are concerned or want more outreach i think thats going to be a great aspect of the convention next week but the hillary clinton supporters i know in virginia are strongly for barack obama
6413850 wir arbeiten quasi schon f r das n chste jahr aber die motivation ist dennoch kein problem
6413851 ich war lange genug nicht auf dem motorrad und bin jetzt wieder richtig hungrig
6413852 red bull wollte meine gage als helmsponsor 2007 um die h lfte k rzen
6413853 ich kenne die leute bei monster sehr gut daher war der deal eigentlich eine logische konsequenz am ende des tages geht es auch um das geld mein helm hat seinen preis vor allem dann wenn ein potenzieller sponsor 150 prozent mehr als red bull bietet ich habe monster f r ihr vertrauen 2007 mit meinen podiumspl tzen auch schon einiges zur ckgeben k nnen
6413854 so this race is very much up in the air and up for play
6413855 this is not a poll saying obama has a lock on minnesota far from it
6413856 we were quite impressed by the impact that gov pawlenty has on mccains chances
6413857 our analysis suggests that the mccain ticket jumps by 13 points by adding gov pawlenty to the ticket that is quite an impact
6413858 man muss die t chtigen b rger mit einer starken exekutive sch tzen
6413859 lets be clear our troops have completed every mission theyve been given
6413860 thats not the way we perceive being a champion ive no problem with him doing a show but i think he should show more respect and shake hands after the finish
6413861 not make gestures like the one he made in the 100m he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6413862 where do we find added strength to keep loving and enjoying life when difficulties hit or when we just get tired of trying or when life turns into a boring routine
6413863 sixty million indigenous peoples are dependent on forests for their livelihoods food and medicines
6413864 these people have already been severely impacted by deforestation if the value of their forests increases governments and corporations may be willing to go to extreme lengths to wrest forests away from indigenous peoples and others
6413865 delegates are focusing on finance but to stop deforestation land rights must be centre stage these un climate talks shamefully continue to take place without any meaningful participation by indigenous peoples
6413866 the us could say that it will only join a post kyoto agreement on condition that they it can offset emissions by buying deforestation credits it would be a catastrophe
6413867 it could crash the price of carbon and would mean the reduction of pollution in rich countries would be come quite uneconomic
6413868 these concerns are legitimate and need to be heard and respected we strongly support we have to learn from the past
6413869 without quick and robust investment in securing forest community rights these carbon markets will further marginalise the poorest of the poor
6413870 even the world bank is saying that this is the social justice issue of our generation
6413871 the picnic is an attempt to reclaim public space alcohol bans are the result of a top down bureaucratic definition of public space and an over the top response to perceived antisocial behaviour and social breakdown
6413872 the longer these bans are imposed the more each of us refuse to take responsibility for public space and stop resolving our own issues leading to a more antisocial society this is not a campaign for drunkenness its for the public right to engage in our own space
6413873 the police should be concerned with people breaking the law not with these so called preventative measures cultural issues are not solved with blanket bans but by political and social engagement for which we need a vibrant public sphere
6413874 we want to raise awareness and are expecting to attract people who are annoyed at this fundamental civil liberties issue
6413875 well see what happens but its a bank holiday all over london people will be getting drunk most will not be causing any trouble
6413876 residents in communities around the country rate this is as one of the issues theyd most like to see dealt with
6413877 the aim of these powers is not to criminalise drinkers or drink itself but rather to give police added enforcement powers to seize alcohol from those posing a nuisance to those around you they are only a potential option and in most cases tend to employed in a limited targeted manner after it has been established that a specific area poses particular problems for the community

6413907 both parts of pope john paul iis pontificate were equally important in the first part in which we saw him as a giant of faith with incredible courage extraordinary force a true joy of faith and great lucidity he took the gospel message to the ends of the earth
6413908 however i must say that because of the humble testimony of his passion to my mind these last years of his pontificate were no less important just as he carried the lords cross before us and put into practice the words of the lord
6413909 who had been a master of words thus showed us visibly it seems to me the profound truth that the lord redeemed us with his cross with the passion as an extreme act of his love
6413910 he showed us that suffering is not only a no something negative the lack of something but a positive reality
6413911 he showed us that suffering accepted for love of christ for love of god and of others is a redeeming force a force of love and no less powerful than the great deeds he accomplished in the first part of his pontificate
6413912 in the first part christ teaches the joy of the kingdom of god brings his gifts to men and then in the second part he is immersed in the passion until his last cry from the cross
6413913 in this very way he taught us who god is that god is love and that in identifying with our suffering as human beings he takes us in his arms and immerses us in his love and this love alone bathes us in redemption purification and rebirth
6413914 that thrives on activism on youth on being young strong and beautiful on succeeding in doing great things
6413915 learn the truth of love which becomes a passion and thereby redeems man and unites him with god who is love
6413916 let us therefore pray for all who are suffering and do our utmost to help them to show our gratitude for their suffering and be present to them as much as we can to the very end
6413917 this is a fundamental message of christianity that stems from the theology of the cross the fact that suffering and passion are present in christs love is the challenge for us to unite ourselves with his passion
6413918 in many markets our new prospects are beginning to resist the current

6413920 coal burning primarily in north america and europe contaminated the arctic and potentially affected human health and ecosystems in and around earths polar regions according to new research
6413921 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
6413922 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies

6413928 add that to the fact that hes probably covering three or four more inches with every stride and that hes only taking 40 to 41 strides to finish a 100 and you cannot argue with the math
6413929 all of a sprints velocity is created from point of touchdown until the foot is directly below the body

6414033 in the second half we could have done a lot better but it was still a decent result for us we are still building and looking to get better for the qualifiers
6414034 we have got a game before the croatian one against andorra and it is important we build on our previous games and get the points there
6414035 all the players were really disappointed with not qualifying for the euros it really hurt not to be playing there this summer
6414036 but we will give 110 per cent to try and qualify for the world cup and we needed that sort of test against the czechs going into the qualifiers
6414037 we needed a tough game and i think we got it they were really physical and well organised
6414038 there is more to come but we are always confident we can beat any team if we play at our best and we feel we can get it right in those games ahead
6414039 i had a lot of touches in the first half
6414040 if its my fate to die by an assassins bullet so be it but i cannot be petrified by inaction or fear of assassination and therefore stay in the corner
6414041 im very surprised i have been with mikael basically all the time ive been in the first team squad
6414042 he is a great professional and it is sad to see him go but he has not been playing many games at the moment and he wants to play so all the best to him
6414043 if he wants to go im sure it will be good for him as long as he is happy with it and plays games
6414044 we have made some great offers with some good deals it would be a good move for the players involved
6414045 weve got an agreement with three clubs for three players and possibly maybe four today so i hope something will happen
6414046 agreeing with the club is sometimes the easy part its trying to get over the finishing line with the players regarding personal terms
6414047 i spoke with madrid sporting director pedja mijatovic and with madrid president ramon calderon and they told me that robinho has to stay that he cannot leave
6414048 so we cannot do anything because he has two years on his contract with real madrid
6414049 robinho never said that he is not happy at madrid but the fact is that he has a more interesting economic offer thats all
6414050 yes i have to say that until august 31 anything is possible until the transfer market closes we do not give this matter up as closed
6414051 theyre not really happy times for me but its still alright
6414052 its frustrating if you work hard especially with all the rumours going on and then you dont play
6414053 sunderlands interest is very much for real and im looking to see in the next week whats going to happen because you know im 31 in november so sitting on the bench or not playing is not an option for me

6414082 i dont get this youre making a choice and you expect your co workers to simply accept it because it leads to having a child
6414083 why should anyone from your company give you slack because you are infertile this and the lawsuit that brought up this topic are a joke your personal defects should not allow you to screw over a private business just because you want to have kids
6414084 im not opposed to anyone knowing about it per se but i really dont want to tell anyone else if i tell someone its like an open invitation for them to give me their opinion and i dont need that but i do believe its in my best interest for my bosses to not know about this
6414085 i wonder whether this would have implications for health insurance coverage of these procedures does health insurance typically cover this now i seem to remember about five years ago there was push back from the insurance companies over whether or not infertility was a medical condition

6414089 about 57 people have died in the blasts all of the victims are civilians
6414090 there were two loud bangs and puffs of smoke i rushed to the site it was a horrific scene the bodies were piled up and the place was littered with limbs and blood
6414091 we have prepared suicide bombers to conduct more such bombings across the country if army actions were not halted
6414092 such acts of violence will not dampen our resolve to fight extremism
6414093 we cannot allow ourselves to be bullied by the russians out of ratifying this agreement
6414094 i hope it will be ratified by your parliament quickly
6414095 we followed the standards and procedures laid down in the aircrafts safety manual
6414096 this aircraft already had two flights cancelled because of problems
6414097 if he president robert mugabe convenes parliament it is a violation of the conditions of the talks
6414098 if the mdc is serious and genuine about talks they must sign as soon as possible so that we find the way forward we have given them a chance so we will proceed
6414099 a violation of the mou would be up to mediators to deal with
6414100 that is the outstanding issue how to share the responsibility over the government
6414101 it is not envisaged that the presidents role become ceremonial but on the other hand the prime minister should not be ceremonial either
6414102 we cant force him to return to his home country because he has done nothing wrong in our country
6414103 he started in vietnam so we must return him there and let the vietnamese deal with it
6414104 we can only arrange his ticket we cant force him to get on a plane
6414105 russia no less than nato relies on this mutual cooperation nato is much more in need of russias support of its military actions in afghanistan where natos fate appears to be in the balance
6414106 we are not going to slam the door on nato
6414107 everything depends on nato priorities it the priority is for unconditional support of georgian president mikheil saakashvili then we wont be to blame for the bankrupting of the alliances relations with russia
6414108 there are doubts over the osces role during the initial stage of the conflict they were notified by the georgian side that there would be an invasion but did not warn russian peacekeepers
6414109 this fact makes us reconsider our relations it is an obligation of the osce to report on troop movements and they must answer for it
6414110 the withdrawal has started at a pace that will have all the russian federations forces behind the line of our zone of responsibility by the end of august 22

6414127 i believe that our forces are making progress and will continue to make progress over the next few months
6414128 while it is true that there are some offensives by the taliban it is also true that the tactics that the taliban have had to adopt are more of a guerrilla nature than they are of a head on confrontation with our forces
6414129 they british forces are sacrificing they are among the largest donors of afghanistan they have been with us all along from 2002 till today
6414130 i believe the figure will go up from 60 000 to 80 000 and then to 120 000 and we will play our part in training and mentoring of the afghan army which is an army of high quality
6414131 i believe that in time the figure for the afghan army given the size of this country they need to be even higher than the 120 000
6414132 we understand with afghanistan the front line against the taliban what happens in afghanistan affects the rest of the world and we are determined to work with the afghan government
6414133 we are utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy of afghanistan
6414134 unless the generals chose to assign a cop everyone walking in the wet streets of buenos aires they could not contain this simple but eloquent reminder of freedom

6414137 this multiplicity of roles means water presents many challenges to bakers
6414138 salt is a powerful tool for food preservation as it locks up water making it unavailable for changes it is 11 times more powerful than sugar
6414139 this move towards so called healthier products means the whole way we balance formulations to control water activity has to change
6414140 to control future water activity you have to consider the start of the process
6414141 if you have done your job properly at the beginning then there is less of an issue as some of the water activity will be controlled
6414142 baking is one of those strange food preparations processes where first of all you have to add water and then remove it again

6414158 i have never suggested and never will that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics and personal ambition
6414159 i have not suggested it because i believe he genuinely wants to serve americas national interests now it is time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain

6414173 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6414174 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6414175 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6414176 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6414177 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted
6414178 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our program
6414179 israel must not attack iran not speak of it and not think of it
6414180 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6414181 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6414182 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6414183 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6414184 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6414185 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6414186 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6414187 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6414188 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6414189 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6414190 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6414191 when people get to know barack in the way that i know him they will support him
6414192 sen salazar who campaigned as a moderate and even in some cases a conservative in 2004 has now willingly put himself in the position of being a partisan point man for the democratic party
6414193 when obama goes down salazar is going to go down with him
6414194 no one would have ever anticipated the unlikely ascent of barack obama to be the democratic nominee for president of the united states
6414195 no one would have anticipated that i would serve as a united states senator given the fact that we were so poor that we didnt have telephone or electricity on our farm
6414196 those possibilities could only happen in this country thats what makes for me personally this election so exciting
6414197 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6414198 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6414199 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6414200 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6414201 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6414202 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6414203 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6414204 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6414205 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6414206 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6414207 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6414208 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6414209 who are open to doing something on the production side
6414210 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6414211 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6414212 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6414213 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6414214 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6414215 gosh youre lucky to be married to someone who takes such pride in your home
6414216 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6414217 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6414218 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6414219 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6414220 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6414221 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6414222 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6414223 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6414224 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6414225 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6414226 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6414227 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6414228 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6414229 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6414230 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6414231 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6414232 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6414233 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6414234 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6414235 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6414236 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6414237 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6414238 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6414239 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6414240 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6414241 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6414242 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6414243 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6414244 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6414245 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6414246 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6414247 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6414248 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6414249 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6414250 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6414251 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6414252 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6414253 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6414254 when the ball goes too high you cant see it too easy
6414255 but its ok because if it is raining for us it is raining for them
6414256 with its aircraft order books so full that some customers must wait as long as five years for deliveries boeing can ill afford a strike especially one that could further delay the rollout of its new 787 dreamliner jet
6414257 it should be granted the same exemption given to commercial traders because its business of buying commodities on behalf of investors was similar to the middlemen who broker commodity transactions for commercial firms
6414258 held 11 percent of all the oil contracts on the regulated new york mercantile exchange
6414259 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6414260 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6414261 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6414262 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6414263 record labels release so much crap these days i think i could do really well
6414264 nothing coming out of my label will be crap but if it were it would just be a single if theres one crap single that has the potential to make a shitload of money id release it
6414265 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6414266 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6414267 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6414268 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6414269 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6414270 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

6414273 dopo il lungo periodo di praparazione racconta balzaretti per gli utenti de ilpalermocalcio it tutta la squadra non vede lora di giocare per i tre punti quando si inizia una nuova stagione c sempre unemozione speciale naturalmente spero che questa sia migliore di quella passata dove in determinate occasioni siamo stati davvero sfortunati
6414274 lho sempre detto per me essere rimasto in rosanero stato un grande onore sono rimasto insieme a capuano cassani e fontana quelli che avranno maggiore voglia di riscatto diciamo che lanno scorso sono stati commessi degli errori anche se giusto sottolineare che in una squadra ci si difende e si attacca in undici magari chi sapeva di dover andare via ha anche perso un p di entusiasmo comunque ormai tutto alle spalle durante la preparazione il mister ha curato molto la fase difensiva e sono sicuro che i nostri tifosi non soffiraranno come nello scorso campionato
6414275 questanno noto un maggiore entusiasmo ammette il difensore rosanero forse perch molti giocatori sono alla loro prima esperienza a palermo e giustamente la consiserano con un punto di arrivo vedo la squadra crescere di giorno in giorno frutto di un sistematico e serio lavoro dobbiamo fare in modo di divertrci in campo e far divertire il pubblico e con il modulo del 4 3 3 questa possibilit ci sar sicuramente
6414276 sar una partita molto importante perch vogliamo passare il turno perch abbiamo volgliaa di arrivare fino in fondo in questa competizione sar anche loccasione per regalare il primo sorriso ai nostro tifosi che durante il primo allenamento al barbera hanno dimostrato ancora una volta lattaccamento a questi colori
6414277 non dobbiamo aver paura di nessuno conclude balzaretti ma nello stesso tempo non illudere la gente
6414278 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

6414281 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

6414288 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6414289 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6414290 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6414291 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6414292 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6414293 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
6414294 if senator obama is truly going to bring transparency to washington this is surely no way to do it
6414295 and maybe this is a playing out of his negotiating with dictators and people like that without preconditions
6414296 to move ahead in the israel syria negotiations as much as possible so that whoever is the next president would not start from too far down the track i did not say anything about obama or mccain i said whoever is the next president is not going to want to inherit a process that isnt going anywhere
6414297 that is surely not the way to be conducting foreign policy to engage in missions whether youre not certain whether youre being used or not
6414298 it would seem to me the american people are entitled to more than that israel bonds build israel
6414299 the other way to deal with the availability of information isnt to forbid exposure but to accept it and limit the time spent playing with the content
6414300 microsoft said on monday that the server version of windows 7 will not be a major release and will bear the name windows server 2008 r2 the move is surprising given that in the past microsoft has used r2 monikers to signify a product with a few new features as opposed to major changes to a product microsoft declined to discuss what will be in windows server 2008 r2 but a spokesman confirmed that it is the server version of windows 7 the release is due sometime in 2010 microsoft said
6414301 the chinese army again fired on a crowd on monday august 18 in the kham region in eastern tibet
6414302 one hundred and forty tibetans are reported to have been killed but the figure needs to be confirmed
6414303 reliable witnesses say that 400 people have been killed in the region of tibetan capital lhasa alone
6414304 killed by bullets even though they were protesting without weapons their bodies were never given back to their families
6414305 all around the gate i saw blood and human flesh people helped the injured and took them in their cars and even on motorbikes to the hospital
6414306 seven or eight people were already dead and another 10 people were breathing their last

6414317 in the mainstream media i rarely get to write about what i most want to write about a truly honest examination of race in the workplace that schools and colleges are unfair to boys and men that reverse discrimination is a net negative to society and that education especially higher education is americas most overrated product and desperately needs reinvention
6414318 i might not agree with all your contentions but i sure respect your bravery and integrity in forwarding them

6414328 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6414329 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6414330 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6414331 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6414332 i would kill myself if i had to work at a place like that

6414347 it actually came out of the writers strike i had a great script from this writer named michael sullivan that needed a little work but when the strike happened we couldnt sit down and work on it so we pitched it out to a couple of comic book companies
6414348 i can see it in a number of different ways i mean it could be a movie it could be a digital series it could be a tv show or it could just be a great comic thats the thing that i think myself and my partner russ cundiff are very much wanting to do just make a good book he knows how passionate i am about comics and graphic novels thats all we want to do just make a really good book
6414349 i was a huge comic book fan when i was a kid i went to a place called fidonia funnies in orange county once a week with my dad its nice to be able to give back i feel like im contributing to a bit of the world that raised me in a sense
6414350 if they called me and said do you want to play spider man of course i would
6414351 so i have no fear of jumping into it going from heroes to playing a superhero in anything else that i do you know its kind of cool you want to be a superhero when you grow up
6414352 if the devil wears prada were a reality show it would be good afternoon bbcrazies
6414353 i think its divisive for the support hillary campaign to continue at this time she made the decision to fully support mr obama
6414354 i dont know why theyre not taking their cue from hillary and falling in line
6414355 her supporters acting on their own because theyre proud of what they have done for her
6414356 we had hoped that this kind of politics especially from within the party would have been abandoned
6414357 we have a historic moment that we need to grasp and we need to move forward as a unified party

6414364 there were bodies lying everywhere and wounded people soaked in blood were screaming for help
6414365 many of the wounded were either without legs or hands i could see body parts hanging on trees
6414366 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6414367 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6414368 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6414369 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure

6414488 now we have extended our sensor designs and discovered other possible uses one such use could be as an id tag for cells in an epidemic such as a bird flu outbreak from a population our sensor molecules could help track infection and highlight vulnerable people
6414489 also as logic gates are what drive current computers molecular versions of these gates open very interesting possibilities

6414508 the zensah leg sleeve could speed up your performance and reduce recovery time according to research and runner reports compression sleeves improve performance of the most important muscle for running the calf muscle the zensah leg sleeve is the only calf sleeve which incorporates pin point compression to the calf area i recommend it for use when traveling on flights to and from a marathon
6414509 our compression clothing has a more ergonomic fit has specially engineered compression zones and is far more comfortable than any other compression clothing on the market
6414510 we allow athletes to focus on their training and competition not on their clothing
6414511 there is no question that with the success of olympic athletes it will raise the awareness of the benefits of compression clothing we believe that zensah will benefit greatly since our technology is superior athletes always are looking for that edge and zensah has that qualitative advantage

6414560 he was close to my grandson and i would see him up here almost every day riding his bike
6414561 its been a very smooth beginning but we have grief counseling available for students who may need to talk to someone
6414562 the school psychologist provided our teachers with a packet of information and helped prepare them with things to look for and what to say to students who are grieving

6414581 china is not a place for the weak of heart
6414582 some of the cafta countries have pretty well developed financial services infrastructures
6414583 i think at 17 i was bouncing off the walls very immature and not taking everything in and now its just different you have more responsibilities
6414584 it was an american record my best time ever and my coach said it was a perfect swim so it was sort of a bitter sweet medal but it definitely was the most emotional one
6414585 not something that lends itself to on the job training
6414586 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
6414587 jam s se produjo ning n accidente y se transport a m s de 100 millones de pasajeros
6414588 es una canallada comparar un a o malo con la cat strofe
6414589 c mo se puede pensar que un posible malestar laboral en algunos colectivos haya podido contribuir a una dejaci n
6414590 no se pueden relacionar las dos cosas ni por lo m s remoto
6414591 son ellos los que tienen que hacer una valoraci n del balance de spanair
6414592 es duro decirlo ante una cat strofe como esta con muchos muertos y a la vez pero s lo en un fin de semana en europa hay un n mero equivalente de fallecidos en la carretera y nos hemos acostumbrado a convivir con esta tragedia

6414594 the growth rates of gross domestic product remain rather high it was 7 9 percent in the first seven months
6414595 later on even the growth in oil prices wont set off the decline in oil and gas revenues resulted from the reduction of this sectors share in gdp further appreciation of ruble may also drive down such revenues
6414596 if god be for us who then can be against us

6414600 and the only words i know to that song are
6414601 we expect the divesture of the remaining assets to be complete by the end of this calendar year we will use the proceeds from the sale of these non core assets to fund the continued growth and development of the product line in the homeland security area we arent selling everything obviously in contrast we recently announced the acquisition of a small san diego company ion metrics that has several key building blocks for our future use in the explosive detection arena
6414602 the security industry has become a mainstay in todays society the cost of being free of worries from terrorist action is one the government has spared no expense and when compared to the alternative is easily termed a bargain from taking the war to their turf to increased security regulations and personnel in airports and harbors security measures being put in place have kept those of us at home safe from deadly attacks
6414603 while america has attempted to shore up her borders other countries are following suit china is under a large magnifying glass with the olympic games currently underway israel has constantly been under scrutiny in the volatile middle east region europe has also attempted to decrease the probability of attack even with their close proximity to terrorist nations the bulk of our business comes from the international sector and we expect that to continue in the short term on the other hand weve continued to work with the department of homeland security the transportation security administration customs and border protection and other agencies to develop new products for their needs in the u s
6414604 the international olympic committee disciplinary commission held a hearing today in relation to her adverse analytical finding the a and b sample analysis were positive for the substance methyltestosterone

6414606 the day at lords is a bit of a blur but the celebrations went on loud and long
6414607 were a close knit club and some in the 1983 side have never gone away
6414608 harold banks still plays for the third xi and bill davies is our groundsman
6414609 the lesions start out as bumps that are itchy little round raised bumps the fibers are quite alarming
6414610 when you lay down as soon as your head hits the pillow your hair starts crawling
6414611 it gives you the sensation that you have worms under your skin or rats crawling on you
6414612 we ripped out our carpet and burned our carpet and furniture and move out into our r v and they were still on me
6414613 the hardest thing was seeing him just get worse all the time
6414614 one of the hallmark clues to delusional parasitosis is what they call the matchbox sign i guess in the older days people would take their samples in little match boxes to their physician
6414615 a brick wall they have their answer and they arent open to discussing the possibility they could be wrong
6414616 if there were a peer reviewed study with 15 or 20 patients who have the same exact thing in their skins then maybe id believe it
6414617 when fiberglass curtains first came out many people with skin conditions were diagnosed with delusions of parasitosis dop but studies showed these patients had tiny fiberglass particles in their skin
6414618 there are many anecdotes of alien abductions but that doesnt mean they are true and as for the pictures you can see pictures of the loch ness monster on the internet too
6414619 i accepted specimens from four different people in four different counties in the bay area and i looked at them very carefully over and over again under the microscope
6414620 the colors and shapes of the fibers of each individual were very very similar
6414621 talking about it just sounds crazy but there are just a lot of things that come out of their skin
6414622 i think we are a looking at a major problem that has been unrecognized in humanity right now
6414623 the yet unrecognized form appears to have a broader clinical presentation wider geographic distribution and vastly greater prevalence
6414624 the lab tests that we do are predictably showing certain immune damage and it is consistent from patient to patient to patient to patient
6414625 all the doctors have to do is buy a 30x hand held microscope from radio shack and look

6414631 its the age when you realise that the first flush of youth is truly over the age when you teeter on the cusp of real life the age when young athletes reach their peak
6414632 i think the church should stop just showing grace to these nutjobs like todd bentley and start distancing ourselves from them just admit you are a liar and repent you dont need therapy you need a swift kick in the ass

6414635 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
6414636 no matter how much we judges emasculate ourselves there are some lines we simply cannot let the legislature cross we must if nothing else remain the last best defenders of insular minorities
6414637 what if say in all the rural districts with low population numbers hand a slew of minor party candidates the seats for those districts but due to the demographics urban vs rural the overwhelming majority of party votes go to the majors such that the seat apportionment percentage formula doesnt support the number of non winning party seats handed out directly by the voters
6414638 so then new zealand has the special olympics version of an election everybody wins
6414639 im in the u k all the time but of course i cant bring all my friends so ive decided to look for a new bff across the pond i need a best friend who is hot who can keep up with me and most of all who is real and wont be a backstabber im not leaving london until i find that amazing girl or guy who can meet the challenges of being my british bestie

6414643 he was supposed to do my makeup this morning so that we could catch up i think that the world just got a little less pretty
6414644 no country in its right mind would want this pervert at large on its soil
6414645 thailand is not allowing him to enter the country and hong kong is turning him back so there is no choice for him now worawat said
6414646 it is the responsibility of thai airways to take him out of the country
6414647 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6414648 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6414649 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6414650 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6414651 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6414652 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6414653 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted
6414654 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our program
6414655 den allm nna bilden har ju varit att de h r v lf rdstj nsterna tagit mycket stryk dragits ner och tvingats spara men i sj lva verket visar det sig nu att tillskottet p resurser varit mycket stort och betydligt mer n vad som kan f rklaras av befolkningsm ssiga sk l
6414656 i have had the knack of knowing what is going to be a hit and i think its just by keeping one side of your brain as a kind of like a fan and a general public
6414657 i still buy new records and i am still crazy about lots of new bands
6414658 you are talking about people who are all genius in their own right when you are working with people like that its almost like falling in love over and over again because you are exchanging ideas and concepts that you normally would only do in a personal intimate relationship but with genius writers
6414659 i just keep working for instance kate perry and i have written a song on her new album and her single is number one and the same time i am still writing new songs with mick jagger since 1985 i dont try to remain current or fashionable i just do what i want to do
6414660 i was thinking i would really like to play live again
6414661 i thought that id love to play with a whole orchestra and a band and fuse them together so its not like an orchestra playing along politely its a full on rock fabulous orchestra
6414662 now i want to make it a spectacle so now i am launching this whole rock fabulous clothing line with christian audigier and hes designed all of the costumes for the orchestra
6414663 we eventually built up this sound and when we got on the road all of the scores are written so the orchestra can play along but i can loop it so we can do instrumentals and the orchestra knows whats happening and we can get back to the verse its unusual
6414664 i have taken some incredible pictures of bjork who looks like shes in a weightless spaceship that will be in the exhibition
6414665 i want the curtain to drop and have their breath taken away
6414666 so when we launch into sweet dreams with all of the cellos and everything its like going to see a real show
6414667 per capita faculty productivity based on articles in top journals

6414669 the brilliant employees used an instrument located just below the cockpit window that is critical to the operation of the onboard computers
6414670 they decided this instrument the tat probe would be adequate to use as a ladder

6414674 you cannot record the date time or contents of a dv d8 format tape onto the disc
6414675 a m en el colegio siempre me dec an que el islam es en cuanto a creencias y ritos una de las religiones m s permisivas en el catolicismo en seguida vas al infierno por cualquier tonter a
6414676 el islam permite la libertad religiosa y el ate smo
6414677 no se sabe en toda la historia del islam que los musulmanes hayan obligado a nadie sea cristiano o jud o a doptar el islam
6414678 los musulmanes nunca han caido en la arrogancia incluso en los tiempos de su mayor grandeza y triunfo
6414679 cuando occidente viv a en un periodo de terrible oscuridad la resplandeciente estrella del islam trajo luz paz y alivio

6414683 i married him for better or for worse but not for lunch
6414684 people go back to work after end of year and summer holidays and say i cant go on living like this anymore im not going through another year
6414685 in daily life couples can be so busy with work and social commitments that they spend little time together
6414686 but sometimes all day every day for a couple of weeks is too much if you are used to having time apart in your daily lives allow for this when you are on holiday
6414687 but if youve been burying your head in the sand about relationship problems long hot leisurely days
6414688 many couples take a holiday in the hope of reviving a foundering relationship but its the late summer that i get a high level of inquiries for counseling the divorce lawyers are busy at that time too
6414689 they may be right but sometimes it can be helpful to recognize the things you need to change about your life so as to feel happier all year round
6414690 there is him there is her and theres the relationship and very often the third part is forgotten people work on the assumption of im doing this and im doing that and forget about the we part

6414692 and hopefully voters will give us a chance to improve facilities by voting in favor of a bond issue
6414693 there are still a couple of issues that were wrestling with but that 135 million figure is correct as of the end of wednesday afternoon
6414694 our previous work produced important data but it involved short term acute interventions
6414695 this study will be the first long term investigation into whether nutritional supplements and aerobic exercise benefit normal but sedentary older people
6414696 obviously were keeping an open mind that it may or may not work we hope that it does work though because these would both be safe and widely applicable interventions that could help us in keeping older people healthy fit and independent
6414697 its too early in the litigation to specify an amount
6414698 he had no insurance and was riding around in a private vehicle with the logo of a pizza place on top of the vehicle
6414699 and any legislation that would result in compromising access for women to the medical services required to terminate a pregnancy
6414700 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this
6414701 to say theyre not bothering anyone or doing anything wrong is a misnomer
6414702 do i think homeless people are bad no but theyre here because its easy and because we werent enforcing public order crimes weve received a mandate from the citizens to clean up the city and take back the neighborhoods so here we go
6414703 the ones that were usually out here giving us problems are in jail right now
6414704 i cant rest i understand some of it i dont like people begging me if youre not bothering nobody why do you have to move where do you want me to go
6414705 but putting things on the skin puts them straight into your blood stream
6414706 try to use products that are as plain as possible
6414707 the fewer ingredients the better and dont trust the labeling claims
6414708 what we are looking at is as much as 300 000 cubic yards of debris coming down from the burn areas and thats if we only have a small to less than average rain year
6414709 though last year wasnt a big rain year on january 5 the san marcos pass gauge registered nine inches of rain that night nine inches in one night this year would cause major flooding it could be like a freight train coming down the mountain
6414710 i cant represent to anyone that we can stop the flow from impacting the goleta valley
6414711 there is a risk here that we cant totally abate but well use every tool we have at our disposal to do as much as we can
6414712 and we want to do everything we can to get the woody vegetation out of the channels as soon as possible so they stay open and allow the sediments to continue down to the siltation basins
6414713 but this year we could fill them with a storm perhaps three inches total
6414714 for one that dumps more rain especially if the rain exceeds an inch every half hour which is often the case we may not be able to handle that much debris flow and more than likely we can expect flash flooding
6414715 our turnaround time is about a week before the next storm event
6414716 but the odds arent good that well be that lucky
6414717 now is the time to get it if you are concerned about your home flooding
6414718 policies dont go into effect until 30 days after being activated if you wait until the rain starts to fall it may be too late
6414719 one has to be socially aware its part of being a decent human to be tested for stds its just disgusting behavior when people dont its so irresponsible
6414720 at the beginning it was very frightening because of the bombs because of the guns there were always people being killed for a young man it was very frustrating
6414721 i live with that frustration and i remember everything and i have those images and pictures in my head
6414722 the actors attended the classes and made friendships with the students
6414723 they wanted to get closer to their life situation and what we found was very shocking and devastating in some cases
6414724 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
6414725 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
6414726 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
6414727 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
6414728 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
6414729 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
6414730 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
6414731 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
6414732 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
6414733 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
6414734 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
6414735 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
6414736 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
6414737 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
6414738 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
6414739 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
6414740 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
6414741 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
6414742 abu dhabis geography and our vision to become a world leader in renewable energy makes thin film pv a natural area of focus for masdar
6414743 germany with its technology highly skilled workforce attractive investment climate and direct access to the european market make it an ideal partner for masdar

6414745 you do a great job im always informed energized and encouraged by your coverage youve got a reader for life
6414746 there were bodies lying everywhere and wounded people soaked in blood were screaming for help
6414747 many of the wounded were either without legs or hands i could see body parts hanging on trees
6414748 the annually laminated i e varved sediment record from the lower mystic lake near boston ma contains a series of anomalous graded beds deposited by strong flooding events that have affected the basin over the last millennium from the historic portion of the record 10 out of 11 of the most prominent graded beds correspond with years in which category 2 3 hurricanes are known to have struck the boston area thus we conclude that the graded beds represent deposition related to intense hurricane precipitation combined with wind driven vegetation disturbance that exposes fresh loose sediment the hurricane signal shows strong centennial scale variations in frequency with a period of increased activity between the 12th 16th centuries and decreased activity during the 11th and 17th 19th centuries these frequency changes are consistent with other paleoclimate indicators from the tropical north atlantic in particular sea surface temperature variations
6414749 the lml sedimentary record provides a well controlled and annually resolved record of category 2 3 hurricane activity in the boston area over the last millennium the hurricane signal shows centennial scale variations in frequency with a period of increased activity between the 12th 16th centuries and decreased activity during the 11th and 17th 19th centuries we recognize that the lml record is a single point source record representative for the greater boston area and hurricanes that passed a few hundred km to the east or west may not have produced the very heavy rainfall amounts and vegetation disturbance in the lake watershed necessary to produce a strong signal within the lml sediments nevertheless we also note that clear evidence of a secular change in hurricane frequency identified in the lml record is consistent with other lines of evidence that conditions for the development of hurricanes have changed on centennial timescales hence it appears that hurricane activity was more frequent in the first half of the last millennium when tropical atlantic ssts were warmer and eastern equatorial pacific ssts were cooler than in subsequent centuries
6414750 we knew going into this venture that running an ice bar would prove fairly difficult not only in convincing richmonders that the city could handle a true club atmosphere but also with the climate crisis our environment is facing these days
6414751 ultimately though the rapid heating of the earths core and depletion of ozone led to our demise
6414752 she was a very vibrant life force in our group
6414753 so we really think about her at the canyonville performance
6414754 from the opening note to the finishing note you could have heard a pin drop
6414755 we got a standing ovation for a small group from glendale to put on a show and have that sort of response was really neat
6414756 i jokingly tell them theyre my 12 step program i dont need one

6414827 there are very few drugs with strong evidence of effectiveness in treating trigeminal neuralgia
6414828 if people fail to respond to these drugs physicians should not be reluctant to consider referring the patient for surgery often surgery is considered a last resort and patients suffer while the well intentioned physician tries other medications with limited effectiveness
6414829 if patients dont respond well to carbamazepine or one or two other drugs it is reasonable to consider surgery that targets the root of the trigeminal nerve

6414941 entergy wants to reduce its investment risk despite the tremendous demand for electricity in the united states a nuclear power plant is a dicey investment that is why so few plants have been built in the last 20 years part of the danger is public aversion to nuclear power which can slow the building process another serious financial hazard is the significantly long term commitment of waste which the plant typically stores on site indefinitely to add to the problem at the end of a nuclear power plants life the nuclear reactor itself becomes waste and must either be dismantled and removed to a long term storage facility or entombed in concrete the nuclear regulatory agency requires entergy or any nuclear utility to set aside at least another 300 million for that eventuality and allows up to 60 years to complete the task but where does the waste go and how will it get there the united states built a long term repository for high level radioactive waste in yucca mountain nev but the good people of nevada dont want it and who can blame them it is also a bit of a logistical and public relations nightmare to transport the waste how are we going to move tons of high level nuclear waste through the country secretly yes probably if at all because of the threat of terrorism and public protest from people who will not want it going through their town so where is the spent nuclear fuel from all those nuclear power plants in the united states and the one current mississippi plant going now absolutely nowhere as standard practice it is stored on site virtually every nuclear plant is also for practical reasons a nuclear waste storage facility spent nuclear fuel rods are too radioactive to be safely moved for at least six months after they are removed from the reactor so what entergy wants in essence is a down payment for a very long term relationship with nuclear power and nuclear waste that will extend actively at least 100 years into the future
6414942 if the world embraces nuclear energy where will the deadly waste go thousands of canisters of highly radioactive waste from the worlds most nuclear energised nation lie silent and deadly beneath a jutting tip of normandy above ground at the site in beaumont hague in france cows graze and atlantic waves crash into heather covered hills the spent fuel vitrified into blocks of black glass that will remain dangerous for thousands of years is in interim storage like nearly all the worlds nuclear waste it is still waiting for the long term disposal solution that has eluded scientists and governments in the six decades since the atomic era began recent talk of a nuclear renaissance has focused on the front end or reactor construction engineers are designing the next generation of reactors to be safer than todays and theyre being billed as a solution to global warming nuclear reactors do not emit carbon dioxide blamed for heating the planet few people have been talking about the back end industry speak for the hundreds of thousands of tons of waste that nuclear plants produce each year and the lucrative secretive business of storing it away greenpeace and norwegian environmental group bellona say european nations have for years been illegally shipping radioactive waste to russia and leaving it there the french fuel stays in normandy indefinitely while bulkier lower level nuclear waste is piling up in dumps worldwide

6414947 muscatine iowa today 2 000 metric tons of separated highly enriched uranium and plutonium stockpiled in civilian and military programs pose a significant proliferation risk these stockpiles could grow if plans for an expansion in civilian nuclear energy materialize since 2005 more than 20 countries that do not now have nuclear power have expressed interest in installing nuclear reactors with more reactors it is likely that additional uranium enrichment and possibly plutonium reprocessing plants would also be built current efforts to restrict the expansion of such sensitive technologies are competing with efforts to promote plutonium as an energy resource the systems that guard against state diversion of and terrorist access to sensitive materials that could be used in nuclear weapons are already under duress
6414948 the uk is set to become home to some 800 tons of highly radioactive nuclear waste after it emerged that the disaster prone thorp reprocessing plant may have to remain closed permanently the government has admitted that the spent nuclear fuel shipped in from overseas and currently stockpiled at sellafield may have to remain in britain the revelation is a major blow to the reputation of the nuclear industry at a time when the government is mulling whether to approve the construction of a new generation of atomic plants the admission came as the department of trade and industry prepared the ground for the permanent closure of thorp its controversial nuclear reprocessing plant at the sprawling nuclear complex in cumbria the 1 6bn plant is now largely obsolete as reprocessing spent nuclear fuel is no longer considered viable it has been closed since april 2005 after a major radioactive leak was discovered

6414951 the big boys continue to say we need nuclear weapons we need to develop more modern nuclear weapons we need mini nukes we need bunker busters but it is bad for you to have nuclear weapons simply if you go anywhere people will tell you this is called double standard it is not sustainable and i try as much obviously in my job to make sure that we do as much to avoid proliferation but we are working against the tide unless as frank walter mentioned weapon states have to lead an example they have to show the way that we are making our way to move towards nuclear disarmament that is no now a fantasy when i see people like george schultz or henry kissinger or sam nunn talking about abolition these are not people who are naive or no aware of security deterrents these are people who through their maturity have come to the conclusion that nuclear weapons as they call it is increasingly hazardous decreasingly effective and if you really want to protect ourselves you need to move towards nuclear abolition

6414953 indian negotiators have so far failed to have their way with iaea on two key issues in what will be yet another setback to the prospect of the operationalization of the indo us civil nuclear deal
6414954 we would wrap it up in the next round of talks in mid january
6414955 what lethal nuclear items iran may already possess cannot be inferred from the performance of its uranium conversion and enrichment facilities and from the spotty intelligence that shaped the nie indeed irans highly publicized nuclear energy program could serve as a convenient cover for a parallel small scale but potentially lethal weapons building effort that relies extensively on black market operations to obtain strategic nuclear wares irans black market dealings are shrouded in mystery but its procurement networks for nuclear bomb ingredients have most likely focused on the former soviet union irans legal nuclear cooperation with russia for example could mask and facilitate a variety of illegal transfers and also give iran plausibility regarding its motives and actions also iran like other aspiring nuclear actors may seek weapons components by means of smuggling chains that they either patronize or control russia of course has long been a focus of proliferation concern even the most modern security systems are vulnerable to insider theft especially when senior personnel of the enterprise are involved the latter would know how to circumvent or defeat the various steps in procedures designed to contain nuclear material at authorized sites
6414956 the united states knows how to kill but kills better with uranium bombs
6414957 the recent nuclear saber rattling of pres george w bush in response to the perceived threat of iran developing nuclear weapons has made some leading u s physicists nervous bushs threat to use nuclear force against a nation that does not have nuclear weapons jarred 22 physicists to the point of asking congress to restrict the presidents power to use nuclear weapons washington dc ahn the recent nuclear saber rattling of pres george w bush in response to the perceived threat of iran developing nuclear weapons has made some leading u s physicists nervous bushs threat to use nuclear force against a nation that does not have nuclear weapons jarred 22 physicists to the point of asking congress to restrict the presidents power to use nuclear weapons the 22 physicists include twelve nobel laureates

6414961 we feel that the st pauls towers demonstrates that a growing number of employees are waking up to the fact that unions dont deliver what they promise
6414962 employees need every cent these days and are more willing to trust management to provide a fair safe and rewarding workplace than continue paying union dues with little or no return
6414963 they promised so many things yet were never able to carry anything through
6414964 people want to see results all we got from the union was empty promises
6414965 the union adopted a new amendment to its constitution at last months seiu convention requiring that every local contribute an amount equal to 6 per member per year to the unions national political action committee this is in addition to regular union dues unions that fail to meet the requirement must contribute an amount in local union funds equal to the deficiency plus a 50 penalty
6414966 abuses of workers true wishes not only are potential they are guaranteed there is no free choice in this travesty clearly a payoff to union leaders who contributed so handsomely to the democrats november election victory
6414967 senate majority leader harry reid has decided to hold a vote this wednesday on perhaps the most unpopular element of the democratic agenda under the so called card check bill a company would no longer have the right to demand a secret ballot election to certify a union thus stripping 140 million american workers of the right to decide in private whether to organize

6414978 parca suntem intr un film politist din pacate totul este real ceea ce ma ingrozeste cel mai tare este faptul ca cineva umbla pe strada cu identitatea mea
6414979 am ramas paralizata cand am auzit ce mi a zis eu nu vroiam sa vand terenul acel barbat mi a mai zis ca el a cumparat pamantul cu toate actele in regula de la cineva care se numea exact ca mine avea aceeasi adresa numai ca fotografia din buletin era alta
6414980 mi s a spus ca proprietatea mea fusese vanduta in luna martie la dosar era si contractul in care la vanzator aparea numele meu iar la cumparator era aurel constandin nu au vrut sa mi dea actul functionarii mi au spus sa merg la politie sa fac plangere lucru pe care l am si facut in aceeasi zi
6414981 nu intabulasem terenul pentru ca m am gandit sa fac acest lucru atunci cand ma voi hotari sa vand se pare ca persoana care mi a luat identitatea facuse acest lucru in numele meu de asemenea nu am dat nimanui actele de mostenitor o singura data le am scos din casa dupa mostenire cand am fost la primarie pentru a deschide un rol fiscal
6414982 am verificat actele originale pe care le aveau persoanele de la care am cumparat atat la notarul care a autentificat tranzactia cat si la judecatorie totul era in regula persoana de la care am cumparat terenul avea buletin identic cu cel al adevaratei proprietare numai ca fotografia era cu totul alta oricum am depus toate actele la politie

6414988 on april 15 2008 it had been decided that the next step would require revisiting the massage parlors secretly introducing tape recorders and tape recording the sex acts
6414989 it was also decided that in order not to cause breiner to be assigned to engage in multiple sex acts required to make a felony charge a second officer would be enlisted which led to the involvement of lt david kiker in the operation
6414990 on all the fundamental issues that affect the lives and well being of our members the choice of candidates in this election is clear
6414991 more than 10 years ago our union undertook a comprehensive program of change in order to meet the needs of our members and the industry it was difficult but necessary and the results of that work are clear our union is growing and our members are enjoying the benefits of that growth

6414999 land for wildlife queensland celebrated its tenth anniversary today at the first property that registered with them in the state
6415000 land for wildlife encourages landholders to preserve and restore the wildlife habitat on their properties
6415001 following its establishment in queensland in 1998 land for wildlife attracted 184 landholders in its first year
6415002 this year the number of registered properties is expected to exceed 3300 covering an area of more than 350 000 hectares
6415003 landowners should be congratulated for investing their time effort and money to ensure queensland has a healthy environment for future generations to enjoy
6415004 nature refuges protect remnant bushland native flora and fauna corridors for wildlife and places of historical or cultural significance
6415005 queensland now has more than 250 properties listed as nature refuges which protect more than 550 000 hectares of bio diversity across the state
6415006 respect for the democratic and constitutional processes is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
6415007 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
6415008 the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation
6415009 everyone knows that we disagreed with his decision in terms of the state of emergency that he declared but he kept to his word he took off the uniform and its now a democratic government in pakistan
6415010 these are issues that theyre going to have to work through their political process
6415011 this is a fight that they are in as well
6415012 so were all in this together and the people of pakistan and the government of pakistan know that
6415013 we want to help the people of pakistan get through their food emergency and the concern they have and that we have over the economic condition of pakistan and so were confident that we will maintain a good relationship with the government of pakistan
6415014 i am thrilled the 30 part series with a budget of close to 13 million will return to shoot on location at sea world and the gold coast later this year
6415015 the teen mermaid drama starring queenslander claire holt has become a very successful television series and is broadcast around the world in more than 100 countries
6415016 earlier this year h2o made history by becoming the first non american live action series to be acquired by us broadcasting giant nickelodeon
6415017 h2o is a shining example of high quality australian content finding its mark internationally
6415018 the series is also a great marketing vehicle for queensland as a world class television production base and tourist destination
6415019 the pftc has committed development investment and production funding in recognition of the highly anticipated third series which will have strong market appeal and local industry impact
6415020 the previous series also funded by pftc garnered enormous global success and received logie and nickelodeon kids choice award nominations
6415021 police will be keeping a very close eye on all gang members participating in the bike run and any criminal or anti social behaviour will be targeted
6415022 make no mistake outlaw motorcycle gang members are not welcome in queensland and police are proactive when it comes to cracking down on their illegal activities however we can not prevent them from legally participating in a group bike ride
6415023 police will be out in force to ensure all participants obey the road rules anyone who breaks the law either on the road or during their visit will face the penalties
6415024 the queensland police service outlaw motorcycle gang task force will also be monitoring the movements and activities of participants
6415025 over 300 motorcycle riders are expected to travel between coffs harbour and the gold coast before travelling up to the sunshine coast as part of the rebels bike run this weekend
6415026 some may also attend the annual bike week on the gold coast next week
6415027 as is the case during all bike runs by outlaw motorcycle gangs police will be watching them every step of the way
6415028 during the past 12 months the qps outlaw motorcycle gang task force in conjunction with regional police has coordinated the response to the bandidos national run finks rolling bike show on the gold coast and a number of other outlaw motorcycle gang poker runs
6415029 police operations during these events enabled significant intelligence gathering and the enforcement of criminal and traffic offences sending a clear message to all outlaw motorcycle gang members that they are being closely watched in queensland
6415030 any death in these circumstances is a tragedy and the government is sympathetic to the concerns of family members who are under a lot of stress following the death of a loved one
6415031 i met with the families again today to provide them a copy of the governments response to their recommendations and informed them that the government has supported 16 of their recommendations and has noted one other recommendation
6415032 the government carefully considered these recommendations taking into account the views of the families and the roles of government agencies in our society
6415033 i would like to thank the families for their commitment to the review of the process for handling people suffering from mental illness during public incidents
6415034 again the government carefully considered these recommendations but at the end of the day we havent supported them due to implications for police operations and other difficulties in implementation
6415035 one recommendation was that police involved in critical incidents be required to provide a blood specimen for analysis instead of urine
6415036 however the government formed the view that urine testing is adequate to disclose if drugs might be present in an officers system at the time of a shooting
6415037 there is no evidence that officers with five years or less experience are involved in any more or less firearm related incidents than more experienced officers
6415038 queensland police receive excellent training at the academy including the appropriate use of firearms
6415039 a development application by australand to preserve restore and adapt the heritage listed yungaba building and build a new multicultural centre plus three eight storey apartment blocks on the site was approved by brisbane city council on 27 june 2008
6415040 the new multicultural centre included plans to provide community groups with a dedicated home offering facilities such as a 200 seat auditorium kitchen and offices and conference rooms
6415041 the decision to call in this development application will allow me to use the integrated development assessment system idas to reassess the application and make a final binding decision in a much shorter timeframe
6415042 proposals to redevelop the site have been around since at least 2003 making this call in is the start of providing certainty to the community about whether the project will go ahead and what conditions may be placed upon it if it does
6415043 bees are a model species to study because of their amazing capacity to learn and remember things and for their astute sense of smell and vision
6415044 whats significant about the bee house is that it controls external factors such as temperature and light which is vital for studying their behaviour patterns
6415045 this research will look at how bees respond to various stimuli and that will allow our scientists to have a better understanding of their brain functionality to help develop therapies for human brain diseases and also advance uav technology
6415046 and the broader application of this research is in the development of uavs scientists will look at biologically how a bee flies so that it can be replicated in a uav
6415047 our research will hopefully increase our knowledge of brain functioning which will in turn lead us to finding new and effective ways to treat brain disorders like parkinsons disease strokes alzheimers and depression
6415048 the queensland governments smart start strategy 3 is about moving
6415049 finally brethren rejoice be made complete be comforted be like minded live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you
6415050 as we previously announced the higher feed input and fuel costs at our jennie o turkey store segment pressured profitability and contributed to the year over year decline in the companys third quarter results
6415051 it was a fun and informative session enough so that i recommend seeing kstate librarians whereever they present they are a fun loving group who communicate knowledge well
6415052 governments should be focused on performing vital services for taxpayers not on acting as a bill collector for private groups especially groups that are lobbying officials and funding political candidates
6415053 engage in face to face solicitation a technique fraught with the potential for coercion
6415054 the unique nature of the states intervention therefore strongly suggests that the states purpose here is exactly that against which the first amendment protects the denial of payroll deductions for the purpose of stifling political speech
6415055 the unions so called burden of political fundraising is shared by all political entities and candidates
6415056 nothing in the first amendment forces local governments to act as a unions political fundraiser
6415057 we argued that the ninth circuits decision broke from well established case law
6415058 the ninth circuit used the first amendment to erect a wall between the state and local government bodies if upheld the ruling could undermine a states ability to adopt many reasonable labor management laws
6415059 a mans moral qualities as much as his physical resources and skills producing thereby the ideal complete athlete

6415069 green light to cut spending but not to red light cameras

6415072 these grants are quite literally a lifeline for those struggling to find a decent home while trying to manage complex drug therapies
6415073 however i feel that my audience wants more they have a big dream they want it now well soonish and it requires fuel lots of it money and lots of free time to boot
6415074 this is going to make everything accountable and the money will go according to statute
6415075 we certainly will be challenging these findings on a number of grounds both procedural and substantive
6415076 the fact that the judge refused to acknowledge his own responsibility in these matters reveals a great deal
6415077 hij heeft dus absoluut niet voor mij op de knie n gelegen
6415078 lippens heeft mijn mobiele nummer en het nummer van mijn secretaresse hij heeft mij echter helemaal niet benaderd
6415079 laat een van de partijen maar eens zeggen wat de werkelijkheid is
6415080 we hebben gesmeekt en alles gedaan maar het was nee
6415081 on this visit i dropped by the home of bao tong a former senior communist party official who spent seven years in prison for challenging the hard liners during the tiananmen democracy movement the guards who monitor him 24 7 let me through when i showed my olympic press credentials
6415082 were talking about doing a green port and a green railroad and it can be done
6415083 our goal is to serve the district in whatever function the district desires
6415084 there was nowhere to go when the south end was closed down
6415085 were very interested in seeing what can be done here
6415086 we fully supported 116 of the recommendations partially supported another 23 and only rejected two
6415087 our response to the recommendations will form the basis of our new right to information legislation
6415088 in many cases we have fully implemented dr solomons recommendations and gone even further particularly in relation to cabinet documents
6415089 for members of the public access to information will be easier and quicker
6415090 it will break down bureaucratic barriers and make us the most open and accountable government in australia
6415091 in addition the government will go further than the recommendations removing the cabinet exemption after 10 years so access to specific information will be available on application in line with the public interest test
6415092 i will also ensure cabinet information is released proactively on a regular basis
6415093 gocs are an arm of government and given ministers are ultimately accountable for their activities we agree they should not be completely exempt from foi
6415094 i think the option we have come up with strikes a good balance
6415095 the current documents based exclusion will be repealed however we will still retain limited exemptions in relation to those gocs engaged in commercially competitive activities
6415096 this is consistent with the approach in other states and territories where government business enterprises who operate in competitive environments are exempt from foi
6415097 we agree there should be a more structured approach to charges for access to documents
6415098 however we do not necessarily agree that this should be based on the number of pages rather than an estimate of the time taken to conduct searches and process the application
6415099 our estimates show the proposed model could actually lead to increased charges and i certainly will not support that
6415100 parts of the act that were suggested be repealed protect items such as the confidentiality of the witness protection program adoption information child protection notifications and personal tax information
6415101 we believe there is a compelling public interest in protecting this information from public disclosure in all circumstances
6415102 this is massive reform that will require significant administrative and cultural change
6415103 it will require investment of time and resources but the benefit will a more open and accountable system of government in our state
6415104 we need to check on you before we can spare the time to talk with you

6415161 in order to attain the goals of the ikb rescue mission kfw took on an extraordinarily heavy burden but one that is not too heavy to handle
6415162 what is important is that we have now closed the chapter on ikbs rescue we do not face any more unforeseeable risks with regard to ikb we can now go back to concentrating fully on our work as a promotional bank
6415163 i was just wishing that you hadnt been so unhappy and had such a low opinion of yourself as a young girl and that i could make the pain of those memories go away for you but then i realized that if you hadnt had that experience growing up then you probably would never have loved me and i would never have known you even existed no matter what happens little girl ill never regret knowing you and loving you
6415164 im sorry little girl i dont want to make you cry i just want you to know that my life will be better just because of you just knowing there really was a soul mate for me and i thank god that he finally brought you to me since i had stopped searching
6415165 what made you think that you were in love with me
6415166 i started to feel something in the car on the way to the hotel after you told me about how you had fantasized about me all your life and then i told you that i would never be able to do a love scene in a movie with you because it would be too realistic remember i said i hadnt even kissed you yet and that i was afraid when i started i would never be able to stop i almost said ever at the end of that sentence but i wasnt sure how youd take it i thought that you just wanted me to fulfill your fantasies and that love wasnt part of the deal and i didnt want to scare you away then when i kissed you in the elevator and it felt as if i was melting into you i knew but i wouldnt let myself think about it because i had no idea what would happen between us
6415167 i realized you loved me when you told me about what that bastard did to you and how it had affected you and i thought you had never been made love to properly until you told me that i had and that i did every time i looked at you every time you heard my voice every time i touched you
6415168 i almost called you on it then but you didnt come right out and say it so i decided to leave it up to you to decide when or if you wanted to tell me but if you had never brought it up then i would never have let you leave until i told you that i loved you and made you admit your love for me
6415169 i never believed my fantasies and dreams about you were meant to come true and when it happened it shocked me and scares me you see the scary part about all of this for me is that even in my own dreams and fantasies you never loved me or needed me you just desired me which was all i needed i never imagined that you could love me im no one special what could you possibly have ever seen in me
6415170 you say you love me and that you trust me is that really true
6415171 then why dont you believe me when i tell you how beautiful you are and i am not just referring to your physical beauty little girl your friend lynn knew you better than you thought and told you the truth some day some man would come along and realize what a wonderful person you are and i dont believe that i am the first man to realize that any one of those other men who begged for the chance to be with you again probably realized it but you were too blinded by your fears and pain to see it i am going to do everything in my power to make you realize that you deserve to be loved especially by me or by any other man smart enough to realize how wonderful you are
6415172 you have complete control over me my heart my soul my body
6415173 if you still intend to walk away from me tomorrow night then tell me now because if you do then i intend to carry you upstairs and throw you on that big bed in the master bedroom and not let you out of it so i can fuck you every time my body is able to until then even if it ends up killing me i wont care because right now the thought of never seeing you again scares me to death so tell me
6415174 i dont know what im going to do i dont know if ill be able to walk away i dont know if ill be able to stay all i know is that i need you and if you die from fucking me then ill die with you
6415175 i cant keep my dick inside you forever but i can sure as hell leave as much of my sperm inside you as i can
6415176 ive been wearing my tennis shoes and some sandals i kind of mix them up
6415177 the aggressive russian force beyond south ossetian borders has been something that really shocked many people the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of the georgian port of poti is a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
6415178 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of any possible conflict

6415180 poland in deploying the us system opens itself to a nuclear strike that is 10
6415181 if the eu wants to play a role in reaching peace it needs open channels of dialogue to tbilisi and to moscow
6415182 calls from some eu member states particularly those in eastern europe to deal harshly with moscow by scrapping talks with russia on a new strategic partnership have put germany in a tricky position germany is heavily dependent on russian energy and remains an advocate of closer european ties with moscow

6415190 disputes be resolved peacefully through dialogue so as to achieve regional peace and stability
6415191 rapidly escalated the tension and raised international concerns and public anxiety
6415192 some analysts even showed the concern that military antagonism could evolve into a new version of the cold war
6415193 war is not the way to settle conflicts the only way to effectively resolve disputes is to disregard old grievances cease hostilities and negotiate for peace only in the backdrop of peace and in the framework of constructive negotiation can a win win deal be reached
6415194 an analysis of americas global missile defense system shows that washington is deploying its elements primarily in eastern europe rather than japan or other asian countries or australia this is probably because washington does not want to irritate china which could respond by stepping up the development of its own missile program and increasing the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles on combat duty
6415195 despite its diminished status following the soviet breakup in 1991 russia alone possesses weapons that can destroy the united states a military industrial complex nearly americas equal in exporting arms and the planets largest oil and natural gas reserves it also remains the worlds largest territorial country pivotally situated in the west and the east at the crossroads of colliding civilizations with strategic capabilities from europe iran and other middle east nations to north korea china india afghanistan and even latin america all things considered our national security may depend more on russia than russias does on us

6415220 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside

6415240 hmmm if this comment above was one of the things i
6415241 the story here is i left my camera on a nearby table
6415242 when we look at the strategic threat picture when we look at patterns of criminal activity that all levels of government show when we look at what is ultimately going to involve limited resources we have to get to a point where we prioritize
6415243 we prioritize based upon threat vulnerability and consequence as we speak today theres nothing in the threat picture that would suggest an imminent emp attack
6415244 one of a small number of threats that can hold our society at risk of catastrophic consequences
6415245 which are essential to both our civilian and military capabilities
6415246 has the capability to produce significant damage to critical infrastructures that support the fabric of u s society and the ability of the united states and western nations to project influence and military power
6415247 several potential adversaries have the capability to attack the united states with a high altitude nuclear weapon generated electromagnetic pulse and others appear to be pursuing efforts to obtain that capability
6415248 a determined adversary can achieve an emp attack capability without having a high level of sophistication for example an adversary would not have to have long range ballistic missiles to conduct an emp attack against the united states such an attack could be launched from a freighter off the u s coast using a short or medium range missile to loft a nuclear warhead to high altitude terrorists sponsored by a rogue state could attempt to execute such an attack without revealing the identity of the perpetrators iran the worlds leading sponsor of international terrorism has practiced launching a mobile ballistic missile from a vessel in the caspian sea iran has also tested high altitude explosions of the shahab iii a test mode consistent with emp attack and described the tests as successful iranian military writings explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states while the commission does not know the intention of iran in conducting these activities we are disturbed by the capability that emerges when we connect the dots
6415249 the recovery of any one of the key national infrastructures is dependent upon the recovery of others
6415250 the longer the outage the more problematic and uncertain the recovery will be it is possible for the functional outages to become mutually reinforcing until at some point the degradation of infrastructure could have irreversible effects on the countrys ability to support its population
6415251 at present our highest priorities are things like preventing nuke attacks as well as working with state and locals to build up their capability to prevent and respond to things like ied events or catastrophic natural disasters
6415252 as it relates to what our greatest preoccupation is were doing everything we can to try to prevent a nuclear or radiological attack on our soil that would have the most severe impact in terms of loss of life or economic consequence

6415292 this is one of my favorite charts a comparison of the distance a car can drive based on either of the following forms of energy each produced on 100m x 100m of land 2 5 acres how come that biofuel does not really cut it electric cars are about four times more energy efficient than fuel based cars no matter whether they are based on biofuel or other fuel this is because any fuel engine mostly creates heat and thus wastes the majority of the available energy units combine this with plants not being very efficient solar energy harvesters relative to semiconductor based solar electricity and the result is this huge difference

6415377 i see that mark hasnt featured in wolves team so i know he will probably be getting a bit frustrated

6415382 the video games business has become increasingly global with the majority of the publishers releasing games in multiple markets

6415390 most six sigma and lean training is based around thinking from 20 years ago based on successes in motorola and ge we wanted to take an up to the minute look at what makes a successful programme today
6415391 as the use of the lean six sigma methodology and tools are growing quickly researching its success factors is important to make sure that lean six sigma is not misused and so continues to have a high positive impact
6415392 lean six sigma practice has enormous potential to improve business performance how the training of professionals in tools and success factors takes place and the implementation of these in practice is currently an under researched area it should be a concern of all leading researchers and training organisations in this area to ensure that it is performed correctly in order to maximise its impact
6415393 i think practitioners are more critical and focus not only on how well the deployment is accepted but also on how well their internal processes are working eg project selection review sessions bb development etc
6415394 sponsors on the other hand are happy to see positive results and focus less on the process side
6415395 when the general electric heuristic for making initiatives work e q x a effectiveness of the programme is a function of its technical quality times its cultural acceptance is considered it can be seen that there is a fairly even split between cultural and technical factors this implies that the people aspects of any improvement programme are as important as the technical tools and techniques used this is why we at sigmapro spend a lot of time in our training on change management
6415396 in my experience they are often reluctant to do this
6415397 and this has a significant negative impact on initiative success
6415398 never use a preposition to end an android xml attribute name with
6415399 with this medal we hope our needs are better looked after than before here there are 20 people to a room with two people to a bed not all rooms have coolers like ours and we have to share the space with rats and other animals here theres room for everybody
6415400 this is how weve been living we have to make do with what we have its very tough but what choice do we have
6415401 perhaps now that sushil had got a medal more money will come into the sport we have brought it to the attention of the authorities many times but it hasnt made a difference so we carry on
6415402 this is him with his 2005 arjuna award and heres another during the 1998 asian cadet junior meet where he won gold now he has an olympic medal
6415403 we are all very proud of what he has achieved and we cant wait to meet him at the airport
6415404 sushil also had the same difficulties but he had said hell win a medal and he did here at the stadium there are wrestlers from all over the country who are living in these conditions and i hope they are all inspired by what he has done wrestlers dont get jobs so many are unwilling to take it up seriously but now things will be different
6415405 callous attitude of the sports authority of india sai administration could seriously hamper indias medal prospects
6415406 right from filling water coolers to sweating it out in wrestling halls with not even air cooling facilities it was tough for them
6415407 i have seen with my eyes how the wrestling staff practised in the summer heat but still they managed to get a medal
6415408 following a track inspection this morning it is with regret that ttc have unfortunately had to take the decision to cancel the three days of racing
6415409 it is not possible to transfer the meeting to another venue however the meeting may be re scheduled to a later date in september
6415410 we have reduced our import forecast for both years and increased our export forecast for both years
6415411 part of this of course relates to the tight supplies worldwide and part of it relates to the weak dollar
6415412 were looking at 6 7 billion pounds of exports for the 2009 year
6415413 nevertheless it would be down about 23 from the 8 7 billion pounds we will export in 2008

6415448 by the grace of god and your help last year i was elected president of this great country
6415449 thirteen percent of all my presidential appointments are african americans and there are five african americans in the cabinet of the united states 2 1 2 times as many as have ever served in the history of this great land
6415450 i say to you my fellow americans we have made a good beginning
6415451 we have passed a law called the family leave law which says you cant be fired if you take a little time off when a baby is born or a parent is sick
6415452 we have radically reformed the college loan program as i promised to lower the cost of college loans and broaden the availability of it and make the repayment terms easier
6415453 on april 15th when people pay their taxes somewhere between 15 million and 18 million working families on modest incomes families with children and incomes of tinder 23 000 will get a tax cut not a tax increase in the most important effort to ensure that we reward work and family in the last 20 years
6415454 under the leadership of the first lady we have produced a comprehensive plan to guarantee health care security to all americans
6415455 we have a guarantee that there will be some investment in those areas of our country in the inner cities and in the destitute rural areas in the mississippi delta of my borne state and this state and louisiana and mississippi and other places like it throughout america
6415456 and finally let me say we must find people who will buy what we have to produce
6415457 we want to be your partners we will buy your goods but we want you to buy ours too if you please
6415458 that is why i have worked so hard for this north american trade agreement that congressman ford endorsed today and congressman jefferson endorsed and congressman cooper and congressman clement because we know that americans can compete and win only if people will buy what it is we have to sell
6415459 people worry fairly about people shutting down plants in america and going not just to mexico but to any place where the labor is cheap
6415460 but i guess what i really want to say to you today my fellow americans is that we can do all of this and still fail unless we meet the great crisis of the spirit that is gripping america today
6415461 when i leave you congressman ford and i are going to a baptist church near here to a town meeting hes having on health care and violence i tell you unless we do something about crime and violence and drugs that is ravaging the community we will not be able to repair this country
6415462 but he would say i did not live and die to see the american family destroyed
6415463 my fellow americans he would say i fought to stop white people from being so filled with hate that they would wreak violence on black people i did not fight for the right of black people to murder other black people with reckless abandon
6415464 the other day the mayor of baltimore a dear friend of mine told me a story of visiting the family of a young man who had been killed 18 years old
6415465 in washington dc where i live your nations capital the symbol of freedom throughout the world look how that freedom is being exercised
6415466 the other day on the front page of our paper the nations capita are we talking about world peace or world conflict
6415467 these are the hymns i want sung this is the tress i want to wear i know im not going to live very long
6415468 more than 37 000 people die from gunshot wounds in this country every year
6415469 the other day i was in california at a town meeting and a handsome young man stood up and said
6415470 oh this is a terrible thing but what can we do about it
6415471 now when we react that foreign visitors come to our shores and are killed at random in our fine state of florida when we see our children planning their funerals when the american people are finally coming to grips with the accumulated weight of crime and violence and the breakdown of family and community and the increase in drugs and the decrease in jobs i think finally we may be ready to do something about it
6415472 anti there is something for each of us to do
6415473 we want to pass a health care bill that will make drug treatment available for everyone
6415474 the famous african american sociologist william julius wilson has written a stunning book called
6415475 i read a wonderful speech the other day given at howard university in a lecture series funded by bill and camille cosby in which the speaker said
6415476 and so i say to you today my fellow americans you gave me this job and were making progress on the things you hired me to do
6415477 officials who have visited iraq recently crossed us expressed satisfaction with the security and political developments and the resolve of the government move toward construction reconstruction and expanding horizons cooperation with arab and international environment
6415478 we in the iraqi government meet the openness arab regional and international levels in iraq more comfortable
6415479 happy with the progress evident in the security aspects political economic which reveals the considerable efforts made by the iraqi government and its success in achieving security stability and reconstruction projects to move the country
6415480 let me not pray to be sheltered from dangers but to be fearless in facing them let me not beg for the stilling of my pain but for the heart to conquer it
6415481 concentrate put all your eggs in one basket and watch that basket
6415482 got mad at it and dont want it no more
6415483 it is wrong for people to use those diploma mill degrees to increase their salaries
6415484 it is up to local school boards to decide whether they will accept advanced degrees from unaccredited universities we think they should take a very close look at their practices and follow the states example and require that advanced degrees come from accredited schools
6415485 its completely and utterly ridiculous that people at the top of our educational system are being paid rewarded in fact for a degree that for all intents and purposes comes from a fake university
6415486 it is wrong for these degrees to be used for any purposes
6415487 we as a state dont recognize them but there are apparently a few districts that do

6415528 scientists and consumers have known for years that grapefruit juice can increase the absorption of certain drugs with the potential for turning normal doses into toxic overdoses

6415534 she definitely wont see him if he does not meet a top member of the regime
6415535 its un asian to let the envoy wait in vain for her to show up
6415536 it seems unusually rude to the extent that it gives the impression of being insensitive
6415537 my hunch is that having stood him up once she has made her point and will agree to see him before the end of his visit
6415538 he did say he had recommended that the government release all political prisoners including aung san suu kyi and urged them to make sure the 2010 elections are open and fair but refused to talk about the 1990 election result
6415539 the regimes only interest in allowing gambari back is to try to get him to endorse their roadmap
6415540 they have forced the new constitution through a sham referendum and now they are planning elections that are likely to be less than fair or free theyre not interested in anything else they have no intentions of changing their minds or making oncessions to the international community let alone starting a genuine political dialogue with aung san suu kyi and other democratic or ethnic forces
6415541 individual governments are free to endorse or reject the roadmap
6415542 the uns responsibility is to uphold international norms and standards which countries apply in very different ways from one situation to another it is not for the un to take a position on the issue beyond reporting objectively the views and concerns of all parties which i have done and will continue to do

6415566 mobileme is suppose to be microsoft exchange for the rest of us but microsoft exchange does things in a secure manner
6415567 as it is if you run a business using your mac then you cannot use mobileme because it transmits data insecurely

6415570 granted theyre not slumping too much and the site is still performing extremely well but it is down nonetheless i think digg slowly lost its appeal when it stopped becoming a tech savvy haven and tried to expand into areas that its tech influenced crowd didnt care about
6415571 yahoo buzz is taking the digg idea improving it by reducing the frequency of people gaming it and launching with a focus on all topics with its own main page to back it up
6415572 how can digg compete on any one of those levels when digg was firmly focused on tech and didnt try to improve algorithms to make upcoming stories last longer before they went popular or stop certain influencers from being too successful people found some value in using the site but now its nothing more than a placeholder of derivative stories and outrageous comment threads
6415573 not just any stories will end up getting buzzed but when they do they get posted to the front page of yahoo com
6415574 thats some pretty major exposure and the level of traffic driven by yahoo once something gets buzzed is exponentially higher than most other social news sites including digg
6415575 i think the potential that future submissions could appear on the front page of yahoo com is a valuable prospect
6415576 i think yahoos system is going to result in much better front page headlines its less about who you know and more about the actual content
6415577 the possibility of getting on the home page of yahoo is a strong selling point for buzz on the other hand theyre a bit late to the game to open it up to everyone i think for certain types of news it could do well but on topics like tech itll be tough

6415608 the mechanic suffered an electric shock after touching the sidepod and steering wheel of the car
6415609 there was a high frequency ac voltage between these contact points the cause of which has been traced back to the kers control unit and a sporadic capacitive coupling from the high voltage network to the 12 volt network
6415610 the voltage ran through the wiring of the 12 volt network to the steering wheel and through the carbon chassis back to the control unit
6415611 only a small amount of energy can be transferred through this capacitive coupling effect however the energy is sufficient to cause an extremely painful reaction
6415612 the driver was insulated against the car by his racing overalls and gloves and therefore not in any danger
6415613 in addition to the measures required to tackle the issue at hand the extremely far reaching analysis we conducted also gave rise to other recommendations which are of great value for the development of electric kers systems
6415614 among the measures arrived at are changes in the design of the control unit to avoid capacitive coupling effects extended monitoring functions for high frequencies and a conductive connection of the chassis components to avoid any electric potential
6415615 it was not possible initially to reproduce the capacitive coupling effect in the car as the problem was caused by a sporadic error in the control unit
6415616 due to the extremely high frequency of the voltage in the steering wheel the safety mechanisms and data recordings did not pick up on the error
6415617 in the absence of data all the theoretical possibilities had to be systematically investigated and analysed in tests
6415618 furthermore the capacitive coupling effect only occurs under certain conditions without the option of driving the kers test car used in jerez again we had to reconstruct these conditions
6415619 these improvements will remove barriers for sellers so they can make the most of this opportunity and offer even more goods for sale on ebay co uk

6415737 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
6415738 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
6415739 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero

6415782 i always tell darijo that you have to save your money when youre earning it

6415882 the seamless shift gearbox will really be our last development for 2008 and we will now shift our focus to 2009 in the second part of the year
6415883 there will however still be opportunities up for grabs and we need to look to maximise them now
6415884 really what force india has proved is that we look competitive in race conditions and under the right circumstances can pick up points if the chances come our way
6415885 weve performed well on street courses too and with two in the final part this could be a good opportunity for us
6415886 we need to look for a 100 reliability rate to ensure that whenever these chances come our way we are really able to take advantage
6415887 our simulations typically show a benefit of two to three tenths over one lap and possibly more as the driver has the option to get on the power earlier as the car isnt upset by the gear change
6415888 the driver can therefore be much smoother with the acceleration so there is less disturbance when cornering and under power
6415889 we will see an advantage everywhere as you will always ratio the gearbox to get the most out of it at each circuit so its effect over a lap will be fairly consistent from circuit to circuit
6415890 with its limited resources the team has done a very good job to get it introduced this season
6415891 it is a big thing for a small team to introduce such a large component mid season as we dont have the transient dynos and test rigs that the other teams have
6415892 really we were only able to start work on the box when we became force india and had reasonable levels of budgets and resources to make it work
6415893 from an engineering point of view the team has done an excellent job to get it ready on time and the gearbox department has done well to make the introduction of the seamless box almost seamless in itself
6415894 the option of a tax increase is not palatable to the mayors
6415895 i havent seen it rtds new analysis and i dont know what the options are though i cant imagine our metro voters saying yes to a fastracks tax increase today
6415896 were interested in working with rtd to come up with a solution to implement what we voted for
6415897 the mechanic suffered an electric shock after touching the sidepod and steering wheel of the car
6415898 there was a high frequency ac voltage between these contact points the cause of which has been traced back to the kers control unit and a sporadic capacitive coupling from the high voltage network to the 12 volt network
6415899 the voltage ran through the wiring of the 12 volt network to the steering wheel and through the carbon chassis back to the control unit
6415900 only a small amount of energy can be transferred through this capacitive coupling effect
6415901 however the energy is sufficient to cause an extremely painful reaction
6415902 the driver was insulated against the car by his racing overalls and gloves and therefore not in any danger
6415903 without the option of driving the kers test car used in jerez again we had to reconstruct these conditions
6415904 we also had to develop a model to be installed between the steering wheel and sidepod which replicated the characteristics of the human body as an electric transfer element
6415905 in addition to the measures required to tackle the issue at hand the extremely far reaching analysis we conducted also gave rise to other recommendations which are of great value for the development of electric kers systems
6415906 among the measures arrived at are changes in the design of the control unit to avoid capacitive coupling effects extended monitoring functions for high frequencies and a conductive connection of the chassis components to avoid any electric potential
6415907 we have already handed over this safety analysis complete with measures and recommendations to the fia and will also make our findings available to the other teams at the next meeting of the technical working group
6415908 we expect this to be the case in the autumn
6415909 through mid september we will id tag and release monarch butterflies as part of a butterfly population study
6415910 tracking the monarchs will help us understand what we can do to help this amazing creature as well as highlight their phenomenal journey to the mountains of mexico and the amazing return of their grandchildren next spring

6415913 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer
6415914 albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
6415915 we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
6415916 but at the same time i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
6415917 if we learned anything from the music business they just dont win any friends by suing their consumers
6415918 speaking personally i think our industry does not want to fall foul of what happened with music
6415919 not as far as im aware regarding what ea needs to do i cant comment on that ea takes piracy very seriously and people deserve to get paid for content they create
6415920 but as far as im aware we have no plans that i know of to partner with atari and codemasters and chase down consumers
6415921 i check gamesindustry biz every day you have to to know whats going on its definitely the best european news site and is beginning to offer a more global view too theres a ton of information and news on the net but this is the one that matters

6415923 the us as the worlds largest market will be able to view and compare sales for the first time outside of their own market

6415933 these results have shown some fantastic developments daily newspapers are stable and have reduced emphasis on pmie print media in education and third party bulks with healthy growth seen in typical blue collar titles
6415934 the decline of weekly titles were driven by losses suffered by larger titles but a concerning increase was seen in third party bulks mainly from mail amp guardian
6415935 weekend category appears stable but large titles are struggling to maintain their position but
6415936 overall community press and free newspapers are stable with growth coming mainly from new titles
6415937 third party bulk circulation has continued to shrink and is down some 26
6415938 while many titles have shrunk there are those champions in each category that buck the trends these titles show the way forward and should inspire further innovation because it is clear that readers remain vital and responsive to a good read
6415939 it is clear that print has been through a tough time and in certain areas there are still a few hurdles ahead
6415940 while concerns over the economy are certainly valid reasons for some circulation declines it must also be said that some of the declines must be attributed to cutbacks as a result of growing input cost pressures
6415941 the introduction of greater accessibility to the data by decision makers will however ensure increased and more immediate market support

6415954 atl applauds those who have achieved their gcse results this year but needs to remind government that gcses are part and parcel of a narrow subject based curriculum that fails a significant proportion of the young people currently leaving school
6415955 we are not saying that achievement should be made easier or dumbed down or that aspirations should not be high what atl is saying is that the curriculum needs to provide a fully rounded education not a test driven exam based target led system
6415956 employers want soft skills such as initiative creativity punctuality reliability and politeness
6415957 the government thinks it can say all these things should be included but where on whose timetable do we see the opportunity for young people to cover all of these skills and their subjects as well certainly not on any current mainstream timetable today
6415958 atl believes reform cannot come too soon for those who are being effectively dispossessed by the curriculum today

6416006 yeah she thinks that everything bollywood is indian our culture is more than that i mean it is a good thing that she takes interest in this jays daughter thinks everything related to india is lame i am glad our daughter is not like that
6416007 so what are you saying we should go to the parade
6416008 well i am not looking forward to it but it will be a learning experience for her besides the parade is not too far from 5 th avenue where all the designer shops are located while we are at the parade you can maybe do some shopping i noticed that you are low on bvlgari perfume this time of the year they would have end of summer sale and you might find a good bargain
6416009 it is going to be hot why are you not wearing shorts
6416010 oh just in case we go for dinner to a good restaurant
6416011 bah this parade india is on the world map due to our doctors industrialists it people etc those people should be honored not some girl who charges an arm and a leg just to overact and shake her gym toned body and sings and dances around trees like a lunatic gandhiji nehru sardar patel and much more shaped indias destiny and what do we do with independence stand here we are gawk at film stars and eat samosa chaat
6416012 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mikaels versatility experience and calibre will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honours this season
6416013 his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mikael has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league

6416027 till the time the congress government returns the land promised to the amarnath shrine board we will continue with our protests in the country the way the government has snatched back the land from amarnath in the same way we will also snatch the congress territories from them because people of the country are very angry with the regime
6416028 were most concerned with equal pay for equal rights health care benefits for workers in same sex relationships and equality for all people especially lesbians
6416029 celebrities like lindsay lohan are merely gay for play and are attempting to cash in on the faddish appeal of lesbianism without any commitment to our cause
6416030 they never seem to move past the hand holding and eye gazing phase of the relationship theres no sense these two are actually in a commited relationship
6416031 if lindsay would come out and say shes gay and in a commited relationship with ronson then maybe she could use her media clout for good for the first time in her life
6416032 its the year of i kissed a girl for lohan and lots of other chicks out there
6416033 but when the rubber meets the road most of them will end up marrying a man only a few girls will go on to be lifelong lesbians and they will face legal obstacles and societal pressures because of their decision if lindsay cared she could help change that for the better
6416034 if i had to guess id say lindsay would love to come out but dina just wont let her
6416035 look at how bad her career has been going in the last few years dina probably feels this news would kill any chance of a comeback
6416036 lindsay lohan is not only a fake lesbian but shes a fake bitch

6416038 im sitting here and im drinking from a carton of milk right now and the elitexc lightweight champion kj noons face is on the back of this milk carton because hes missing in action i cant seem to find him
6416039 since day one noons manager mark dion has been insinuating that elitexc has been out to get kj noons i just cant figure that out when a guy appears on the very first card and the very first fight gets knocked out in the very first round off the very first punch and were there to hold his hand and pick him back up and put him right back on television in a main event on shoxc and then when hes 1 1 get him right back into a main event situation for the world championship against nick diaz the legend who beat gomi how are you going to say that were not trying to help your kid what more opportunity could we give the kid
6416040 noons is earning in his next fight about 23 000 to show that to me is already more than any fighter who has under 10 fights is making hes highly paid
6416041 if this fight doesnt go off then this a textbook case in business law of harbor it would be called the kj noons case it will be the biggest mismanagement of an athletes career you will ever see
6416042 jake shields and paul daley have a date on oct 4 both fighters have verbally agreed bout agreements are out and were just waiting for them to come back in unlike some others these are two guys that i trust their word

6416067 each death only makes us more determined we are not going to be bullied by the valley anymore jammu wants a voice of its own jammus hindus will no longer tolerate oppression by kashmirs muslims
6416068 vohra did neither he only added fuel to the fire he has been insensitive and his actions have only served to provoke the protesters
6416069 years of neglect of jammu by kashmir has resulted in what you are seeing today the people are frustrated the pandits have at last found a platform to vent their anger jammu has more people than kashmir but the lions share always goes to the valley
6416070 clearly underestimated the determination of jammus long suffering hindus who have had to cope with denial and deprivation for decades as the state government focuses only on the kashmir valley
6416071 it was his way of registering his protest against omar abdullahs speech in parliament he was incensed by the national conference leaders duplicity

6416078 many lenders arent in a position to handle large inventories of reo and therefore prolonged building vacancy becomes a real issue
6416079 reos often leave municipalities guessing about who actually owns the building because of title issues how long these buildings will remain vacant and what strains they might put on municipal services and revenues
6416080 as the number of foreclosure cases rises and the housing market weakens the above options have become increasingly limited

6416182 ultimately whether a stock will bounce back from a huge drop depends on the ability of company managers to adapt to radically changed business conditions if management successfully finds new ways to be profitable then the odds of surviving a crisis go up substantially but if insurmountable obstacles prevent a company from finding a new direction that will work in the new environment then its much more likely that the companys stock will eventually end up being worthless the best way to evaluate stocks that have suffered big losses is to take a fresh look at them and their prospects if you conclude that you wouldnt buy new shares at the low price then it likely makes little sense to gamble on a recovery but if you can see ways that the company could both survive and thrive again then holding on a while longer makes sense

6416189 the olympics are a special challenge for food producers because athletes demand organic food thats rich in vitamins and minerals and because the olympics food supply is strictly regulated by in country and international olympics committees
6416190 hydroponics allows strict quality control reliable supply environmental benefits and it produces high nutrition crops
6416191 australia wisely chose to rely on hydroponics for its 2000 olympics because soil grown crops could easily have been ruined by adverse weather which is not a problem with hydroponics
6416192 better yet as is the case in north america and europe hydroponics crops cost less to produce and buy than field crops
6416193 the chinese are mastering hydroponics rapidly especially as they produce fruits and vegetables for the 2008 olympics
6416194 in fact the chinese government created a highly regulated guarded organic greenhouse grown plant production infrastructure to guarantee the quantity and quality of the fruit and vegetable supply for olympic athletes and visitors
6416195 fact is organic fruits and vegetables grown hydroponically for the china olympics are packed with vitamins and minerals which means athletes perform better
6416196 and china is able to meet the demands for quality food better than if it was relying on regular soil agriculture healthy organic hydroponics food wins the gold medal at the 2008 china summer olympics in beijing

6416199 our compression clothing has a more ergonomic fit has specially engineered compression zones and is far more comfortable than any other compression clothing on the market
6416200 we allow athletes to focus on their training and competition not on their clothing
6416201 there is no question that with the success of olympic athletes it will raise the awareness of the benefits of compression clothing we believe that zensah will benefit greatly since our technology is superior athletes always are looking for that edge and zensah has that qualitative advantage

6416241 over six hundred of the operations that were cancelled were in fact brought forward to an earlier date and around 1 000 were administrative cancellations which are about how the hospital schedules its work
6416242 having an operation cancelled can cause huge distress for patients and their families its simply unacceptable that these figures are so high
6416243 the shortage of icu intensive care unit beds for major surgery patients is a common problem especially in winter
6416244 the number of cancelled operations needs to be set against the huge increase in the number of patients that the nhs is treating
6416245 between 1997 and 2008 the number of elective admissions has increased by over 1 5million while the number of operations cancelled at the last moment remained at less than 1 5 per cent
6416246 all universities now have to take the parent factor into account
6416247 on university open days you can see more parents attending than children
6416248 there is a powerful sense of infantilism where parents cant let go
6416249 these parents are paying more so they think they can demand more
6416250 this is usually because the parent feels they havent got all the information they need from their son or daughter and so phone back to double check and clarify points

6416271 we wanted to pose a dilemma to existing and potential donors during the month of ramadan the idea is that after seeing the camping the next time they are carrying out actions such as praying or fasting they stop to think and not take for granted common practices for instance one of the creatives depicts hands in a position which can either be interpreted as an act of praying or begging

6416297 its the closest to hell that ive seen the bodies were boiling hot we burnt ourselves collecting them
6416298 knowing the plane was bad it took off with my seven year old niece
6416299 i think what a lot of people here in spain will want to know and certainly the relatives of those who perished on the plane is if there was a technical issue with the flight which delayed its take off initially and it was then given the go ahead to take off why was that
6416300 what was the technical issue which caused the delay and why was the go ahead then given for the plane to at least try to take off and head for gran canaria

6416322 israel has refused transit to more sick palestinians seeking treatment since hamas took control of the strip and several of them die unnecessarily every month
6416323 despite the agreement between hamas and israel there has been no improvement towards patients in gaza in israeli policy which seems even to have become worse to the obstacles imposed by the general security service on people who want to leave gaza for medical treatment patients face more bureaucratic difficulties imposed by the army which prevent them enjoying their right to health
6416324 unrwa receives barely 56 of the resources it needs to look after the refugees it supplies 60 of their daily diet which does not meet western recommendations on personal nutrition

6416326 the issue is one of justice not of distributing food parcels and medicines to people in need without a system by which israel is held to account for its actions justice does not exist
6416327 israeli policies are designed to limit the number of palestinians living in areas earmarked for settlements or in their vicinity
6416328 the israeli authorities have for many years applied a discriminatory policy of house demolitions permitting on the one hand many tens of israeli settlements to be built on occupied palestinian territory in flagrant violation of international law at the same time as they confiscate palestinian lands forbidding the palestinian population to build and destroying their houses the cleared land is often used to build illegal israeli settlements international law prohibits occupying powers from building settlements for their own citizens on the territories they occupy

6416334 soldiers will never again be sent out to kill campesinos

6416339 what we want is work and dignity for the people of paraguay thats what were fighting for
6416340 and so today were celebrating this is a celebration of the people of paraguay because we won not with guns but with votes a battle against a party of genocide
6416341 were all going to be with him in this struggle because we dont want any more of this suffering
6416342 it was the young people who founded the party all very young people and they believe in socialism were big and were growing there are 6 000 militants in asunci n but were a national presence and have chapters all over the country
6416343 look at the houses theyre made out of cardboard and things rescued from the garbage thats why theres so much sickness like dengue borne from the dirty water in the marginal neighborhoods and you know for them dengue fever is deadly they die from dengue and they die from tuberculosis because tuberculosis is a disease from poverty you know theyre undernourished and susceptible to such diseases which kill them and so were working against all this and we want to make paraguay an example to the world
6416344 each neighborhood has a nucleus of the party but we organize in popular assemblies around the needs that the local people have thats how we hope to build the socialism of the 21st century
6416345 i refuse to live in a country where some cant sleep because of fear and others cant sleep because theyre hungry
6416346 the party is over and its time to get to work today hope has won may it continue for a long time to come

6416576 from the inception of the cct through its final design we have integrated new and innovative specifications to address market needs on a global basis
6416577 our engineering team worked hard in developing this revolutionary device that encompasses all the proven features of the current valimed vm model as well as adding new reporting capabilities and software enhancements to further increase the operating value of the system
6416578 the vision has become a reality we have received very positive feedback from our validation sites and have incorporated input from our international customers and partners in the final design of the cct the new valimed model cct will be displayed at major pharmacy conferences in france spain and italy this fall and we are very excited about going forward
6416579 the shipment of ccts to international customers marks another major milestone in our international development plans
6416580 the importance of the research hospital fund cannot be overstated
6416581 it provides a once in a generation opportunity to ensure that canadian research hospitals remain at the forefront of health research in the highly competitive international research environment and will assist them in retaining their world class scientists and in training the next generation of health researchers
6416582 the science and technology advancements of canadas research hospitals increase our research capacity and provide us with more effective products and services
6416583 the investment we are making today will help us to improve the health and overall quality of life of newfoundlanders and labradorians and all canadians

6416586 with a global resource of 205 million ounces of silver and 4 3 billion pounds of zinc hackett stands as one of the largest undeveloped silver deposits in the world
6416587 as hackett river becomes a development project as with any project in the industry the considerable lead times required for feasibility work permitting financing and construction can have detrimental effects on a companys share price as the market waits out the evolution of the project as a management team we believe the best way to mitigate against depreciating recognition in the market is to create value and provide leverage within the company during this lead time i believe that we can do that by acquiring another asset one that would complement our advanced hackett river project this year we have done the essential work needed to push hackett river and our other exploration projects forward but have focussed on preserving our treasury the current market presents many affordable opportunities which combined with our excellent balance sheet puts us in a very strong position over the past two months management has been proactive in communicating within the m amp a community we have been and continue to be presented with proposals and ideas which we are now evaluating although the company would prefer to focus in the canadian north we will consider opportunities in other politically stable jurisdictions

6416592 this is a really sad story my heart goes out to the families involved
6416593 for some reason though it bothers me that 60 gun owners were asked to voluntarily relinquish their legally owned firearms
6416594 since when does oklahoma have handgun registration i seriously hope they catch the vermin responsible for this but im disturbed by the implication that oklahoma one of the most free states in the usa has handgun registration
6416595 i would never voluntarily submit their weapons for testing get a warrant
6416596 i wouldnt voluntarily submit my firearms to law enforcement without a warrant either this is really starting to bother me why ask 60 citizens to do this or maybe theyre waiting for somebody to refuse to submit voluntarily whereupon they do get a warrant
6416597 why dont they just test fire all the 40 cal handguns in oklahoma yeah thats the ticket
6416598 i hate to perhaps sound callous about the tragedy thats not my intent at all but this is some of the goofiest stuff ive ever heard of
6416599 what the osbi stupidly did was ensure that if the real murderer still has the murder weapon and got one of these letters he will now without doubt destroy it post haste
6416600 human beings can only interact with one another through two methods reason or force if at any point either party chooses force the other must either submit or respond with force
6416601 i prefer reason but i am ready to respond with force submission is not an option
6416602 the issue of private control of firearms in the united states has been a hot topic this year in light of the washington d
6416603 its no wonder that the district is awash with lawlessness the contempt for the law starts in the city council chambers
6416604 the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self defense in the home
6416605 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed

6416623 het slechtste wat in je als tmc onder de huidige omstandigheden kunt doen is niet investeren in sales
6416624 we moeten nog dichter op onze klanten zitten opdat we nog sneller en beter weten wat ze van plan zijn en met wie we zien dat onze vier grootste klanten de behoefte hebben om meer zaken te doen met minder partijen en wij denken dat wij daar bij horen daarbij komt dat we ons genoodzaakt zien om onze risicos over meerdere opdrachtgevers te spreiden een verlangen dat we ook bij onze klanten waarnemen
6416625 onze interesse gaat vooral ook uit naar overnamekandidaten die niet gevoelig zijn voor schommelingen daarin daarnaast zit tmc met zijn werkondernemers dicht bij de kernactiviteiten van zijn opdrachtgevers en we moeten daar in de huidige markt nog dichter op komen te zitten
6416626 misschien dat we wat eerder moeten beginnen met de onderhandelingen voor 2009
6416627 er blijft een groot tekort aan technisch hoogopgeleid personeel in combinatie met de vergrijzing en de behoefte aan goede gezondheidszorg maken wij ons geen zorgen over de vraag naar onze mensen

6416629 seven or eight people were already dead and another 10 people were breathing their last
6416630 there are two torn bodies lying there which we believe are those of the suicide bombers

6416635 the thought behind what were doing is to honor and inspire women and to make sure that people who are diagnosed with having breast cancer are aware of the options out there beyond what they might have been told and to manage their own disease so they can do whatever they can to cure it
6416636 when they learn they have the disease and theres a 50 percent chance they might not make it its a terrifying thing for women
6416637 its a helluva job for lorraine because every one of those women is deserving
6416638 we are interested in their story of survival and how they did it
6416639 its a new technology machine that is not invasive and can detect cancer early
6416640 if arlenes cancer had been detected early wed have been able to take steps to combat it instead of having it sneak up on us
6416641 the problem is that when you take all these radiation and chemotherapy treatments and allow the body to be inflicted with something else you reduce the immune system
6416642 we had a big wonderful park 70 acres and 22 water rides for 30 some odd seasons and built slides in australia and new zealand

6416647 cheer led president george w bushs decision to take our eye off the ball and start a war in iraq that had nothing to do with 9 11
6416648 this is a record that belies anything approaching sound judgment
6416649 he has consistently been quick draw mccain here on every issue his first instinct is to rattle sabers and look for a military solution
6416650 hey if anyone is going to be negative its going to be that old mcsame guy you know bushs third term the old guy married to that trophy wife oh did i mention how old he is
6416651 davin is the kind of guy that might take the boot off and play knowing him
6416652 so im not going to discount him playing in the opener or the third week of the season im just going to say that right now he will not play against jacksonville theres a chance he might not be ready for a couple weeks
6416653 im not happy with it to be honest with you
6416654 im sick for davin joseph hes one of the ringleaders on this football team so im disappointed im hurt for him im also confident that we have the stuff to pick up the slack while hes getting himself ready to play obviously its a tough blow for us here at this time but its also very exciting for somebody to step up
6416655 were working on our rotations at this point in time
6416656 obviously jeremy zuttah will be a factor at that position dan buenning has experience playing guard there are the possibilities of adding a player here or there so i dont want to say too much right now at this point were confident in the guys we have
6416657 het zal u duidelijk zijn dat we bij heijmans in het slop zitten
6416658 maar het is nog te vroeg om concreet te kunnen zeggen dit zijn de maatregelen
6416659 de diverse aspecten hebben onze aandacht dat kunnen we verzekeren het gevoel van urgentie is er wel maar daarvoor moet u ons wel de tijd gunnen

6416688 i learned so much about god and our church from him not because he told me everything but just in the way he was so diligent and devoted to his family and church
6416689 lowell was a man of gibraltar character and faith he was a steady faithful presence in our church lending a hand whenever needed now he is fully enjoying life in all its beauty and glory in the presence of the one who loves each of us more than we can dare to imagine hes fitting right in im sure
6416690 they communicated unconditional love yet in the moments with him that were filled with thoughtful quiet reflection i felt that responsibility and honor to be somebody worthy of that connection i treasured what i could not know but only imagine about my uncle which helped me to understand how similar though much more jesus is like that in my life

6416723 de resultaten van heijmans zijn slecht maar het meest verbijsterend zijn de grote verliezen bij infra en in belgie
6416724 naast het verwachte verlies bij de bouwactiviteiten in nederland zien we nu ook een verlies bij de infra divisie in nederland en in belgie
6416725 hoewel de resultaten over de eerste helft tegenvallen zijn we positief verrast door de resultaten van de vastgoeddivisie in nederland
6416726 echter dit wordt compleet overschaduwd door de slechte prestaties bij de onderdelen bouw en infra en nederland en de belgische activiteiten

6416728 we are thrilled to announce our top 10 list of halloween costumes for halloween 2008
6416729 we expect all of the costumes on our list to be red hot sellers and weve stocked up on them all to help make this halloween a great one for people of all ages

6416731 i obviously know that at the end of the day that the owner has the final say so on whether or not he wants to give a guy an opportunity or not
6416732 mike has wanted to give chris this opportunity and asks that we do the best job that we can to try to prepare him and get him ready to play football
6416733 my goal is to be back for the first game
6416734 he isnt your puck possession type of guy who can carry the puck and dipsy doo hes more of a big body who goes through you and is very good down low the thing that impresses him the most about rj is his ability to score the tough goals down low and he just doesnt miss much from there he also creates plays and notches assist with those little poke type passes to guys in tight traffic areas nothing fancy about rjs game
6416735 said the thing hes got going for him is that hes played against men for a year the league he played in was comparable to the echl hes only been able to watch a game of him on video but said he doesnt see a whole lot of separation between he and stamkos he like the rest of us are interested in seeing what this kid has in camp
6416736 the jackets need to improve their goals for and goals against by 1 to be a playoff team how that divides up it doesnt matter as long as it equals 1 for instance the jackets averaged 2 4 goals for last year and 2 54 goals against last year if they were to improve that to say 3 1 goals for and 2 24 goals against there would be your 1 improvement goal
6416737 on philosophy i asked specifically if we had enough skill to enter the zone the way the wings did on their pp which was to draw the opposition to the sides of the ice to allow a d man like lindstrom to carry the puck directly up the ice while backing off the d and then drop the pass to a forward like datsyuk zetterberg to gain the zone he was well aware of this strategy and said russell and huselius are two guys who could make that work didnt get sense into how much confident he thought in terms of having the player personnel to pull it off
6416738 hitch is excited about this market says now is the time to make a significant move he doesnt want to be chasing the playoff pack this season his goal is to be in that playoff pack jockeying for position
6416739 said that when talking with various folks in the know that they told him when we played nashville that even though we outworked them they werent worried b c they knew only 1 or 2 guys could score
6416740 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6416741 we saw the poor living conditions of babies and children at a russian hospital and orphanage it was run down there were broken windows and there was almost no light the inside was depressing and cold there were cribs in the hallways no hot water heaters and the bathrooms were horrible i thought someone needed to do something for these children
6416742 the children need our help and we will do all we can to help them my wife and i founded little heroes two years ago to raise money from our friends around the world who also want to help
6416743 travis didnt say a lot during our initial meeting with him and i wasnt sure what he was thinking when i explained how uplej works and could help him raise money for little heroes he was silent so i asked him what he thought and he said he thought uplej was an incredible idea travis has built a network of support all over the world he immediately signed up and got his network involved
6416744 there are many people who have created foundations and charities who give up their lives for their causes many of them cannot find the funds to do what they feel inspired to do uplej com creates a unique opportunity for everyone to get involved in charity work even the smaller charities can raise money all people can have the opportunity to help others uplej gives everyone an opportunity to make the world better
6416745 traveling is stressful enough these days but young kids and first time fliers are even more vulnerable to the anxiety associated with new sounds processes and unfamiliar faces associated with flying our goal is to help prepare children so parents dont have to appease them along the way
6416746 chipper is a character kids can relate to so we utilize the stories and activities to playfully teach kids good behavior in a variety of experiences
6416747 chippers plush pillow backpack is our answer to mom carrying the pillow stuffed animal and stuffed backpack
6416748 its lightweight soft and features ties with safety snaps so its three items in one that mom or dad wont have to carry because it rests comfortably on a childs back from check in to naptime and landing
6416749 paola brings a fresh and highly valued perspective to our board in the area of childrens public policy and advocacy and we couldnt be more delighted to have her join us
6416750 i am honored and pleased to be a part of c h e f s board of directors because of our mutual dedication to reducing health disparities in washington state through public policy and advocacy
6416751 i look forward to making meaningful contributions during my board term and to helping c h e f achieve even stronger outcomes in its mission focused work
6416752 i cant say hes in the process of reconsidering no hes not in the process of anything right now to be honest with you
6416753 we have a lot of things to get through obviously
6416754 look hes a kid with an enormous amount of talent and skill
6416755 well a lot of other people have the skill to be a great doctor and yet they decide they dont want to be a doctor anymore stefan felt that he wasnt quite ready to attend training camp next month
6416756 its not a health issue not as far as i know
6416757 hes a passionate kid i loved him as a player he plays with an edge but he also knows how to play
6416758 he was intelligent he was very very well liked by his teammates he liked to be the center of attention but in a good way
6416759 hopefully hell realize what hes going to miss here the opportunity he has to be a player

6416809 that ye might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son

6416820 adapting the 4 picocuries per liter of air as recommended by the u s environmental protection agency the epa recommends taking action if the number is higher as a reference and the house is not in active use crema bourdeaux a type of granite countertop raises less than 7 percent of this action level the second and third highest radon count stone tropic brown and baltic brown can add only approximately 1 percent of this action level all other countertops adds only insignificant amount of radon to the house if normal air exchange rate is applied or the house is actively used then the radiation should be much smaller if proper resealing is applied once a year or at other frequencies recommended by the industry the radon emanation can further be reduced
6416821 its not that all granite is dangerous but ive seen a few that might heat up your cheerios a little

6416852 the polyketal microparticles we developed are simply a vehicle to get the drugs inside the body to the diseased area as quickly as possible
6416853 the major advantage to using these polyketals to deliver drugs is that they degrade into biocompatible compounds that dont accumulate in a patients tissue or cause additional inflammation
6416854 we think these microparticles are going to be fantastic for oral drug delivery because they can survive the stomach conditions before they release their contents in the intestines
6416855 patients with acute liver failure need drugs as soon as possible or else theyll die
6416856 weve tailored the polyketals hydrolysis rates to deliver the drug in one or two days
6416857 delivering proteins inside microparticles has been limited because getting the protein into the microparticles required organic solvents that frequently destroyed the proteins
6416858 to overcome this problem we developed a method of simply immobilizing the protein on the surface of the microparticles
6416859 in the past few years we have developed methods to tailor the polyketals properties which have already allowed us to target many different medical conditions but our end goal is to test these treatments in humans

6417052 2k play did not forecast a million units since it was an original property and a fairly new system
6417053 its nice to know that the retailers are asking for more and more products so were very excited about this franchise
6417054 nintendo is expecting to sell another eight million by the time this christmas is over and so the install base will be about 15 million
6417055 were looking at that as another eight million people who have not purchased the original title yet and so we expect it to continue to sell as well
6417056 we knew that the install base was growing and people are still buying carnival games so we wanted to build on the success of it but with a different type of gameplay
6417057 we think the market can hold both of these carnival games we were originally going to put carnival games 2 out but it was just too early for us
6417058 it wasnt in development but it was definitely in concepting
6417059 we saw the original title was a big success and we had the developers cat daddy thinking down the line for the brand so there will be a carnival games 2 but when that is i cant say that right now we just have to assess the market and see when the right time is to release the title

6417095 we wanted to take a big step forward making a strong design statement for chevrolet products around the world

6417097 chevrolet has always stood for expressive value and cruze delivers on that promise like never before it further redefines chevrolet with its design quality materials and great style inside and out the fit and finish for gaps and interfaces sets a new standard for this segment in europe and around the world
6417098 obsessed with rankings americans are bound to see the beijing olympics as a metaphor for a larger and more troubling question will china overtake the united states as the worlds biggest economy well stop worrying it almost certainly will chinas economy is now only a fourth the size of the 14 trillion u s economy but given plausible growth rates in both countries chinas output will exceed americas in the 2020s goldman sachs forecasts but this is the wrong worry by itself a richer china does not make america poorer indeed because there are so many more chinese than americans average chinese living standards may lag behind ours indefinitely by goldmans projections average american incomes will still be twice chinese incomes in 2050
6417099 the real threat is that china will destabilize the world economy it will distort trade foster huge financial imbalances and trigger a contentious competition for scarce raw materials symptoms of instability have already surfaced and if they grow worse everyone including the chinese may suffer china is now challenging some of the fundamental tenets of the existing global economic system says economist c fred bergsten of the peterson institute this is no small matter growing trade and the cross border transfers of technology and management skills contributed to historys greatest surge of prosperity living standards as measured by per capita incomes have skyrocketed since 1950 up 10 times in japan 16 times in south korea four times in france and three times in the united states significantly these gains occurred without serious political conflict with the exception of oil world commerce expanded quietly the chief sources of global strife have been ideology nationalism religion and ethnic conflict
6417100 economics could now join this list because the balance of power is shifting the united states was the old orders main architect and china is a rising power of the new their approaches contrast dramatically economically dominant after world war ii the united states defined its interests as promoting the prosperity of its allies the aims were to combat communism and prevent another great depression countries would make mutual trade concessions they would not manipulate their currencies to gain advantage raw materials would be available at nondiscriminatory prices these norms were mostly honored though some countries flouted them japan manipulated its currency for years
6417101 chinas political goals differ high economic growth and job creation aim to raise living standards and absorb the huge rural migration to expanding cities economist donald straszheim of roth capital partners estimates the urban inflow at about 17 million people annually as he says china sees export led economic growth as a magnet for foreign investment that brings modern technology and management skills prosperity is considered essential to maintaining public order and the communist partys political monopoly at first china pursued its ambitions within the existing global framework indeed the united states supported chinas membership in the world trade organization in 2001 but as it grows richer china increasingly ignores old norms bergsten argues it runs a predatory trade policy by keeping its currency the renminbi at artificially low levels that stimulates export led growth from 2000 to 2007 chinas current account surplus a broad measure of trade flows ballooned from 1 7 percent of gross domestic product to 11 1 percent the biggest losers are not u s manufacturers but developing countries whose labor intensive exports are most disadvantaged next china strives to lock up supplies of essential raw materials oil natural gas copper if other countries suffer so what both the united states and china are self interested but the united states has seen a prosperous global economy as a means to expanding its power while china sees the global economy guaranteed markets for its exports and raw materials as the means to promoting domestic stability
6417102 the policies are increasingly on a collision course chinas undervalued currency and massive trade surpluses have produced 1 8 trillion in foreign exchange reserves china in effect stockpiles the currencies it earns in trade along with its artificial export advantage china has the cash to buy big stakes in american and other foreign firms predictably that has stirred a political backlash in the united states and elsewhere the rigid renminbi has contributed to the euros rise against the dollar threatening europe with recession china has undermined world trade negotiations and its appetite for raw materials leads it to support renegade regimes iran sudan
6417103 the world economy faces other threats catastrophic oil interruptions disruptive money flows but the chinese american schism poses a dilemma for the next president if we do nothing chinas economic nationalism may weaken the world economy but if we retaliate by becoming more nationalistic ourselves we may do the same globalization means interdependence major nations ignore that at their peril

6417149 we understand the essence of the russian position and its military response
6417150 i want to express my support for the russian position in abkhazia and south ossetia we oppose attempts to tarnish russias position
6417151 it is undoubtedly true that the negotiators have taken this very very far toward an end agreement but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet or that there is going to be today
6417152 but i will have a chance with the prime minister to really know if there are any other gaps that we have to close from washington
6417153 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe can be done whats feasible
6417154 obviously everybody is going to keep an eye on conditions on the ground
6417155 the victory over the georgian army should become for russia not a cause for euphoria and excessive joy but serve to speed up military transformations in russia
6417156 it was remarkable that they shot down a number of russian fighters which russia probably did not expect
6417157 we will be introducing serious changes the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for example
6417158 missiles and rockets would negate the need for large scale troop deployments in the way they had to carry them out
6417159 there is no way they could say from this operation that they are capable of carrying out operations against something as sophisticated as nato forces
6417160 we are very happy to be here and to play our role but we should have been here days ago there are still needs not only for goods but for expertise
6417161 we will concentrate our work on protection of the civilian population tracing missing persons restoring family links and visiting people who have been detained
6417162 we visited the main hospital in tskhinvali which is the only one left standing
6417163 tomorrow 8 checkpoints will be established in the security zone in which 500 peacekeepers will be deployed no more than that
6417164 other peacekeepers will be moved to south ossetia while other troops will be moved to russia
6417165 the russians have driven us from our homes and now we end up as refugees here in a building that used to be the base for russian soldiers serving in the caucasus it is an irony of fate
6417166 things are not so bad here but we all just want to go home as soon as the russians leave
6417167 we escaped with our car and left everything else behind this is my lovely house we dont know if or when we will see it again
6417168 we had to leave my mother in law behind she is 80 we dont even know if she is still alive

6417170 we cant live here we have water and food but we sleep on the floor there is no gas or electricity so we cant even cook the rice and pasta they provide
6417171 this is genocide and russia is to blame we are a small democratic country and russia is the aggressor
6417172 saakashvili had no choice he had to respond sooner or later to the russian provocations what is clear is that the russians wanted this war all along

6417187 that is why it fills me with great joy to see young people some of them not quite 25 yet revisiting ninoy and interpreting what he stood for from a fresh contemporary perspective
6417188 i am thankful that many among our youth continue to derive inspiration from ninoy from seeing our nation and the world through his eyes
6417189 it is even more clear to me now that ninoy was never really mine or my childrens to lose he has always belonged to the people he chose to serve and to die for
6417190 i am what i am today because ninoy brought out the best in me and i think i brought out the best in ninoy
6417191 this wasnt a hateful e mail but one that touched upon a sentiment in this country and around the world that immigrants have to adapt to their new homes

6417195 you know when i was diagnosed with spinal meningitis in 2004 the doctor said i may not be able to play golf again and that i could die or even suffer a memory loss after the surgery so im just happy to be out here playing
6417196 ive played well in brunei for the past three years but have always finished poorly in the weekend ill try to push for a first win but because of my heart problem i tend to get tired very quickly the doctors have said i cant do anything about my health so ive got to live with it
6417197 ive been playing well enough these days and im close the game is starting to come back and i just need to get out there to play its all starting to come together
6417198 using a 23 watt cfl light bulb for 10 000 hours at the same energy rate will cost you only 16 10 this is a savings of 53 90 without factoring in the savings in air conditioning energy as cfls generate much less heat than regular bulbs
6417199 we cant come to terms with what weve gone through
6417200 it feels unreal within a day my wife and i show up at the hospital our daughter is born and declared dead later we find out she is still alive and a few hours later we are told again that she is dead
6417201 i showed up at the intensive care unit and saw that she was dead my wife will suffer from this and well have to deal with it im sure shell need psychological help

6417204 our support of the aperture nature photography workshop is an example of our commitment to make simple safe and expandable storage technology available to photography enthusiasts
6417205 we are honored to work with a digital media pioneer like scott bourne to help educate photographers on the ins and outs of using drobo in their aperture workflows to protect irreplaceable image files
6417206 drobo has earned a reputation within the mac community as being the go to storage solution so partnering with data robotics on this project seems like the most natural choice for us and something we expect will make workshop participants all the more successful
6417207 this workshop will provide an opportunity for pro photographers to share techniques and best practices while experiencing the benefits of world class industry products such as drobo in a fully immersive field environment
6417208 the platform performed very well under stress in all technical areas even with a low boost setting on the turbo chargers we were able to achieve in excess of 180 mph which is remarkable with the addition of the body soon to be completed by metalcrafters and the aerodynamic down force built into its design along with a higher turbo boost setting the company expects the scorpion to break the 200mph speed barrier
6417209 our testing today validates the quality of our engineering and the experience of our team we will continue to refine and improve our car until it meets the high safety and performance standards we have set the successful testing at this phase of the scorpions development is exciting as we approach the sema trade show the popular conference which represents the automotive specialty and performance parts industry

6417215 the services contract performed by ibm engineers on site will help with hardware recovery times and thus facilitate lentas objective to reduce risks related to hardware operations and make the companys it infrastructure more stable
6417216 ibms retail industry and it services experience will ultimately help lenta provide better services to its customers

6417410 globally aedas has been growing at a rate of about 15 20 percent per year and in asia specifically the companys business has grown at a very vigorous 50 percent annually
6417411 with demand from china still increasing and the emergence of rich new markets elsewhere in asia our outlook is for that pace of growth to continue for the foreseeable future
6417412 as previously stated it is the intent of executive management to control either by acquisitions or leases enough stations to generate a minimum of 100 000 000 million dollars per year in revenue with a potential pre tax profit margin of 8 to 12 per year overall the company believes that it would then be in a position to become a fully reporting company and leverage its buying power from its suppliers
6417413 given the regions dependence on airlift the most daunting issues facing the caribbean hotel industry are the rising cost of airfares and the announced cutbacks in air service
6417414 due mostly to the rising cost of fuel four of the five leading air carriers to the caribbean have announced cutbacks in service puerto rico and the dominican republic could see as many as 26 percent fewer flights in december of 2008 compared to december 2007
6417415 the caribbean has always been attractive to price sensitive travelers if airfares continue to rise hotels may have to reduce their room rates in an effort to maintain the caribbeans position as an affordable destination
6417416 despite the strength of the market we have seen shifts in the cruise industry that have been influenced by the rising cost of fuel cruises to more remote ports in the southern caribbean such as aruba are being cut from itineraries due to the length of the trip and fuel required to get there
6417417 to preserve the natural beauty of the region caribbean resorts have had a long history of being environmentally friendly
6417418 hotel operators are now parlaying this experience into energy conservation in addition to installing cost cutting equipment such as efficient light bulbs showers toilets sinks and air conditioning caribbean hoteliers are working with their local energy providers to develop new sustainable technologies this will not only reduce the cost of operations but improve the overall economy of the island on which they operate
6417419 if you profile the hotel projects that are currently under construction there youll find a preponderance of luxury and upper upscale properties
6417420 like the recent trend in the united states most of these projects are resorts with a significant residential component and first class spa
6417421 belize and costa rica are two markets that are becoming increasingly competitive with the caribbean as a vacation destination for u s citizens as well as travelers from europe and south america
6417422 historically caribbean hotels have enjoyed the benefit of paying their employees relatively low salaries and wages however due to rising standards of living among the islands we have started to see a closing of the gap between u s and caribbean labors costs

6417664 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6417665 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position

6417672 i believe in what he has to offer america as a young person i wasnt just going to sit back and watch it all go by

6417685 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6417686 as we look to the future we must continue to strengthen the process and ensure a fair process in which the diverse voices in our party and our nation have a chance to be heard
6417687 that is the essential role that the democratic change commission can and will play and we look forward to their recommendations

6417741 the government has spooked everyone into thinking that we need nuclear by saying theres going to be a terrible energy gap the lights are going to go out in the middle of the next decade
6417742 theres actually no evidence that that is the case at all they have raised the wrong problem in order to push the wrong solution
6417743 the real problem is that our energy mix is not green enough and that we are overdependent as many people now realise because of the crisis in georgia on oil and gas from parts of the world that arent very reliable
6417744 i think it is a question of political will if we have been able to put a man on the moon been able to create the welfare state we could revolutionise the way in which we produce energy

6417775 the good news is that there are a lot of new dentists coming in and when primary care trusts ask for tenders for new services dentists are falling over themselves to bid for them
6417776 when cornwall pct went to tender for four new dental practices they got more than 20 applicants for each one there is no shortage of people coming forward
6417777 we have turned the corner all the data looking forward is positive
6417778 as they already had a lot of private adult patients whom they thought wouldnt like this they opted out of the nhs altogether
6417779 the effects of dentistry on the oral health of five year olds is minimal
6417780 the number of decayed missing or filled teeth in five year olds hasnt changed since 1983
6417781 its entirely a matter of how their parents bring them up international comparisons show that the uk does extremely well in dental health among children compared with comparable countries thats the result of fluoride toothpaste not access to dentists
6417782 if you ring round practices you may hit on a few that are too busy to help you
6417783 but if you ring the local primary care trust they will have a helpline that will direct you to a dental practice that will take you on
6417784 the perception is that you cant get an nhs dentist but it isnt true this perception is preventing many people from even trying if they have the slightest difficulty they should ring their pct
6417785 if you ask people they will say that about 80 per cent of dentistry is now private and only 20 per cent nhs
6417786 that simply isnt true if you look at spending 50 per cent is nhs 25 per cent cosmetic dentistry that is outside the nhs and 25 per cent private
6417787 but if you look at numbers you find that there are 27 million nhs patients and 6 7 million private ones the reason that spending on private dentistry is high is because they charge up to ten times as much

6417847 the event itself is so extraordinary that another chapter could be added to the bible to chronicle its significance
6417848 everythings going to be affected by this seismic change in the universe
6417849 obama has this almost irrational following and i myself cant sometimes explain why im supporting him

6417860 we already had nverzion automation system running at three of our stations so we knew this last system would complete the total automation standard for wv media i had worked with other automation systems during my career but the nverzion automation system has been the easiest and quickest installation i have integrated to date
6417861 now with nverzion on line at all of our stations the xpansion asset management application and the terastore digital storage really fits with our technology and asset management plan
6417862 nverzion is fully committed to the broadcast industry and to providing the high level of service and quality products necessary to help our clients be leaders in their trade
6417863 the value of producing content once and distributing throughout the group as needed has proven to be an extremely cost effective resource for these stations nverzion has raised the bar for asset management solutions based around the traditional automation playout solutions

6417866 were going to keep him off it through the weekend and see where hes at the first of the week
6417867 hopefully the first of the week hes feeling better and we can get him back with the team its all a matter of whether he gets back to feeling that he can practice
6417868 hes a very good tackler hes aggressive that was proven by the things he did on special teams
6417869 were just looking at the best situation to help our team become better and we felt that moving him over to the linebacker spot gives us some added depth and makes us a lot better because of the depth him being older him being mature and him having been in game situations is going to help him naturally see things quicker than the other guys
6417870 at the end of spring i looked at my production chart and he was like one in four every fourth play he made a play
6417871 he runs a 4 5 hes 215 pounds and if you watch him hes like a little buzz saw out there wherever the ball is hes there i think it made tristan better were starting to develop something we didnt know we had
6417872 weve got some real healthy competition going on in that offensive line
6417873 pretty soon here in the next couple days by the first of the week were going to have to name a starting group but lucas is going to play whether hes a starter or not will be determined but hes going to play
6417874 you have divine knowledge that can help others through your spiritual teaching honor your divine know that you are a leader

6417876 i truly empathize with those guys because the exact same thing happened to me but with a burberry scarf
6417877 hopefully they can get this all behind them and continue their important work

6417888 has always been considered illegal the laboratories have only recently found ways to discover it
6417889 the specific test was introduced two years ago this is the first time it has been discovered in sport horses previously only one case in racing has been known
6417890 i got in a good position but got a bit tight in the last 120 metres
6417891 this is tough racing its a different style of our sport i wanted to conserve energy and stay out of trouble
6417892 again we are always pleased to see an improvement in the foreclosure situation even if it is just a month to month adjustment
6417893 although southern california was hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis the northern part of the state has also been significantly affected but not as much in san francisco even in san francisco though median home prices have declined
6417894 the region has seen prices fall approximately 20 to 25 percent since the middle of 2006
6417895 however median home prices and inventories in northern california have begun to level off in the past few months
6417896 wir begr en dass der bund sich so deutlich zu der notwendigkeit von sanierungshilfen bekennt
6417897 others share blame for the result of this conflict of course georgian forces fell for russias ploy and poorly timed their strike against the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali
6417898 dass sich mehr deutsche vor den usa als vor den russen f rchten sagt einiges ber den grad der verwirrung unter den deutschen aus
6417899 till now we have been concentrating on building a strong channel base now we have very active channel segment in two years we have finished 50 cities with our road shows in 2007 2008 we did 30 cities including 5 metros initially our focus was to create awareness among channel partners about wds products and services and we are very successful in that now is the time to do the same with end consumers our focus is also there on small and developing cities ie c and d class towns
6417900 this year we are planning to expand and grow our presence in corporate and smb segment we have already started contact program and road shows for corporate we have finished two cities and we are planning to do around 25 this year more specifically we will focus more audio and video surveillance market and enterprise segment
6417901 there is tremendous growth is external drive market end users seek the need and buy it we want to avail the opportunity so that we are coming up with some more end users centric products
6417902 we do have low cost element series external drives it has good casing but no software is installed in it these drives targets those who are looking for much simple solution rather than buying casing and drive separately and to integrate it customers can prefer these drives the drive is for assembler market who want low cost products for enterprise segment we have a range of sata category of products

6417907 i never needed his help to make plates out of these greenskins heads
6417908 senator barack hussein obama jr repeatedly refused to provide any responses to citizens on the issues through the 2008 political courage test when asked to do so by national leaders of the political parties prominent members of the media project vote smart president richard kimball and project vote smart staff
6417909 are you willing to tell citizens your positions on the issues you will most likely face on their behalf
6417910 i want to get all of us to think and it is very important to not just digest information as given but to think further i will share about the skills relevant about this course but most importantly my preference would to have everyone to develop thinking i know this may not be teachable but its worth doing

6417916 we never imagined that our company would grow so quickly and we owe this great honor to everyone at canvas on demand and our customers
6417917 an improvement of over eight percent in southern california is welcome news and hopefully the start of an upward trend
6417918 however riverside and los angeles counties continue to be major contributors to the 120 percent jump from last year
6417919 the housing market indicators show a declining inventory of homes for sale but the median home values also continue to decline
6417920 many areas have seen home values fall over 30 percent since the middle of 2006 during the housing boom without a short sale or a few other options it is nearly impossible to sell a home that was overly leveraged
6417921 its like a moat theres water all the way around
6417922 you cant tell whats a canal and whats a roadway out here its that bad
6417923 there are certain product lines such as roadms reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexers and tunables where the forecast had been rising faster than the increased capacity that wed been building
6417924 scheduled into fiscal q2 despite the fact that customers have asked for it earlier
6417925 the story is a long complicated one winding its way from china to france by way of the first world war the oil cartel the pharmaceutical cartel and iraq to its final destination a syringe full of something claiming to be a vaccine against the newly deadly avian flu
6417926 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering
6417927 as a physician i understand a basic virological fact that the public has not been told it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist public relations efforts to the contrary if a vaccine is being made against the avian flu virus in its pandemic form that means the pandemic virus must already exist so the fact that the avian flu vaccine is already being manufactured in china by sanofi pasteur reported to be a wholly owned subsidiary of total petroleum a french arm of the cartel supports our contention that the weaponized avian flu already exists as we saw in the case of the anthrax scare of 2001 an allegedly disgruntled government employee can release deadly toxins from even the most secure government facility
6417928 publicly available information shows the pharmaceutical industry and us government are both actively preparing for an avian flu pandemic this is shown through their own promotional literature and propaganda
6417929 the whole notion of an avian flu pandemic occurring without technological intervention is highly questionable to date there have only been around 385 human cases of avian flu identified worldwide assuming those identifications are trustworthy of course with 243 deaths to put the absurdity of this effort into perspective sudden cardiac death scd which many researchers believe is heavily associated with aspartame consumption is a leading cause of death according to the cdc for example scd killed 460 000 americans in 1999 and the numbers keep rising www cdc gov mmwr preview mmwrhtml mm5106a3 htm but aspartame a product of monsanto is an approved substance while the currently non pandemic avian flu is the focus of hugely expensive seemingly irrational preparations if there is no intent to create that very pandemic
6417930 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it drums into us is the
6417931 when my father died i wrote his obituary all my years of access to tv news writers editors and producers didnt help me do justice to his life
6417932 my dad was an average working man but to our family and friends he was much more goal is to provide those from all walks of life a way to effectively articulate their loved ones life story in a special way to produce a video that will store treasured memories for generations to come is a wonderful by product of modern technology
6417933 we understand the intense love and pride people wish to communicate when someone close passes away
6417934 whether a loved one died yesterday or many years ago ob tv will help family and friends remember those they never want to forget
6417935 were both honored and excited to be partnered with the best in digital distribution iris and jake records will make an awesome team
6417936 their team has indicated a steadfast belief in what were trying to do here and together i can only tell the world to expect great things
6417937 a fast growing label like jake records is the perfect fit for us
6417938 they support both ground breaking established artists like digital underground as well as emerging acts like jiggy and the exbox boys which enables us to really get creative with our marketing efforts were very excited to welcome jake to the iris family
6417939 this partnership with iris goes a long way to prove that our mission is not only the right one but one that others can respect and get behind jake records is clearly all about great music and great marketing
6417940 we do things differently than major labels and most independents for that matter we take bigger chances and were finding and attracting better talent as a result iris will step up our game a few more notches and make all of this that much bigger better and brighter
6417941 we are enthusiastic about the prospect of investing our capital expertise time and energy to put ikb back on a sustainable path to long term value creation for all stakeholders lone star has the solid basis to support the strategy of strengthening ikb as a leading provider of financial solutions for germanys mittelstand

6417949 do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
6417950 we can never be surprised at what vile evil comes from the mouth of a confessed victim of child abuse at the hands of her own parents
6417951 roseannes parents responded to the accusation by going on the air and slating she is a psychopathic liar and her sister agreed
6417952 her defaming of our national anthem in 1990 gave us insight into who she is and what she is capable of saying and doing additional information
6417953 so i tried it on of course it didnt fit me

6417961 were absolutely delighted with how things went the level of support has exceeded all expectations fringe by the sea really seems to have caught the imagination of locals and visitors
6417962 everyone ive met in the street has told me what a great idea it is so well almost certainly be doing it again next year
6417963 we will carry on working until we have got a leaseholder in place
6417964 i have known jim kerr for a very long time
6417965 our family businesses have grown up together in haddington i will be sad to see him go but i suppose retirement comes to us all eventually
6417966 he had ran 11 professional flat races under the name off to work we go but was considered to be too slow excitable and untrainable
6417967 as a member of the ex racers club it was just the sort of challenge that i was looking for
6417968 stan and i now compete regularly on the national eventing circuit and he is really looking the part in dressage in fact hes been placed at every dressage competition hes entered every horse deserves the chance to lead a full and active life and our members do their best to help them get a fresh start
6417969 we want more people to consider offering an experienced home to an ex racehorse
6417970 im really happy i just wanted to do something to remember caitlyn
6417971 none of us could believe it for a while any time he walked passed me i would say oh look here comes the nominee and he would just smile it has taken some time to sink in
6417972 at least people will know what i raised the money for caitlyn
6417973 ryan does not like the limelight its difficult to even take a photo of him sometimes he has not told many of his friends
6417974 the most prestigious ceremony and fundraising event in the calendar
6417975 our first date was a visit to the old regal picture house on the corner of lothian road and morrison street
6417976 i cant remember what the film was but we had to stand for ages outside in a very long queue
6417977 we have both kept reasonable healthy and i am in no doubt that the clean sea air of north berwick is responsible for that
6417978 we have always loved the town we used to come down for days out before we got married
6417979 there is nothing better than to take a stroll along the beach if it is a nice day
6417980 i think the secret to our long marriage is that we always try to get on with each other
6417981 we have a few shared interests and thats important in any relationship
6417982 the town is not receiving the attention is should be
6417983 the state of the high street is lamentable north berwick and port seton are blooming but not dunbar we should be saying to east lothian council we have a problem here and we want to work with you to do something
6417984 i say we visit north berwick we could benefit from learning some of the lessons theyve learnt
6417985 there have been resource issues relating to the upkeep and maintenance of dunbars green spaces and standards this year are not as they should be
6417986 dunbar community council may wish to consider setting up its own in bloom group that is something we would support
6417987 so hes very much happier on the days when i get to bring him back earlier and he gets to see me more the initiative that made a marked difference this year is the reduction in hours of teaching we get to do a week what it means is now we get more time at least about four hours extra compared to previous years
6417988 i dont see the teachers rushing so much from meeting to meeting i dont see them rushing to complete their work i see that they look happier and in a sense they are also able to contribute well
6417989 at the beginning of the year one of my teachers wanted to quit because she could not manage looking after her one year old child and work so i offered her a two third workload this means that while other teachers have to cover 15 hours of teaching periods she takes only 11 hours of teaching periods on top of that i give her the flexi hour where she can come in later so that she can attend to looking after her child first early in the morning now shes staying on and shes expecting twins
6417990 i used to work very long hours and i realise thats not a good balance and its taking a toll on my health and i realised that i think its best to work with your team and let them have enough balance because when youre not at your best youre not really focussing or giving the best to your customers
6417991 yester has been a beloved family retreat for many years but now it is time to move on and allow the next generation with new vigour and enthusiasm to take it on
6417992 i only hope they gain as much enjoyment from it as my family and i have over the last 35 years
6417993 yester house is a property of national significance one of scotlands great houses

6418054 theyre very focused on the city of houston and therefore they dont have as much time for cities like katy
6418055 i brought ice to the table and said i need a name and a number to contact and now every time they call the number they get a response

6418071 offenders like glitter can and should be chaperoned while being deported back to the uk where they can be properly monitored it is disappointing this latest development was not anticipated and proper arrangements put in place to make this work

6418085 now we can focus on looking for somewhere suitable to re home him
6418086 losing to oldham was a blow for a number of reasons but were most disappointed to be missing out on the play offs
6418087 i cant fault the effort the players have put in throughout the season and weve done it tough with a host of injuries
6418088 but we cant make excuses youve got to make the most of the chances you get and sometimes we havent done that
6418089 ive been saying to the players this week that they need to go out and put on a really good show for our fans on saturday
6418090 if were disappointed with the season as coaches and players its nothing compared to how the fans feel
6418091 we owe them and with us playing a side going for the play offs i fully expect us to go out there and give them a stern test at the very least
6418092 its a boost securing those players for next year and we are in talks with several others this week in the hope of adding more signings ready for a big push next season
6418093 i feel very proud of myself and im sure the other lad will
6418094 it was a good fight the other lad was older and taller than me so i was a bit scared but once youre in the ring your skills just take over
6418095 i would prefer to be a boxer than a bully and it really helps with your self confidence

6418097 i am very worried when i watch him and when i saw the other boxer in the national fight i was very nervous but im really proud of him
6418098 i thought he won the fight but the referee said it was a draw
6418099 i can remember looking at ricky hatton when he was 11 and he moves the same way as him
6418100 if you cant get someone out of you head maybe theyre ment to be there

6418107 we think newspaper stocks have further room to fall as declining revenues and negative operating leverage combine to create a downward spiral for this moribund industry

6418110 the only thing i can say is pete wilson is the best thing that happened to the california democratic party go for it baby
6418111 the more mean spirited they get the more mainstream texans realize that those types of policies arent in the best interest of our state and they certainly arent in the best interest of our families
6418112 which would hinder state enforcement of the federal immigration laws
6418113 primarily because we believe this is a federal issue that needs a federal solution
6418114 in order to avoid sanctions theyre letting go of their work force before anything can happen
6418115 its creating a culture of fear in the entire community its bad for everybody its bad for the workers and their families its bad for the businesses owners its bad for the community for people who depend on the services of these businesses
6418116 if this were to pass in texas we might see an increase in migration away from texas which might be what they want but it would be very difficult for communities here and cause a lot of strain on families
6418117 we do get a lot of constituencies concerned about illegal immigration in regards that its impacting our communities from a tax dollar standpoint and our education systems our health care systems
6418118 our police department cooperates fully with federal immigration authorities and the ice officials have confirmed that repeatedly
6418119 we may not have billboards up that say welcome illegals to houston but its clear we have a dont ask dont tell dont look dont apprehend policy
6418120 i really believe that the citizenry are asking for something to be done
6418121 id hate for us to spend a bunch of time debating something we dont have clarity on
6418122 i feel wonderful about this new meeting the council called me to tell me about it and i was over the moon
6418123 there have been no promises made yet which is completely understandable but im just feeling so good that i might have a chance any chance at all is worth it
6418124 last week when we got the news we were devastated at the thought that we might close fingers crossed this meeting may save us
6418125 there will be no let up in us voicing our concerns about the devastating economic and social impact these post office closures will have on the communities they serve
6418126 we will work with the post office to explore the opportunities for maintaining a service at adelphi but we are very disappointed that similar options have not been given to the branches on lewis street and langworthy road we will be taking this up with the government minister

6418221 running paid search programs has an impact on organic search results we have seen this clearly in our research
6418222 without the ability to measure these interactions advertisers may be limiting performance by underutilizing ads that increase the number of organic clicks while running other ads that shift traffic from organic search results to paid search results similarly advertisers may be missing significant investment opportunities to further leverage their paid search programs in areas where seo is underperforming not just on a traffic basis but on a value creation basis our goal has been to develop metrics like the search synergy score that measure these effects and provide advertisers with recommendations on how to deploy spending to ensure maximum performance
6418223 as a covario client were excited to see the company leverage its powerful analytics platform capabilities to help advertisers manage interactive advertising with full visibility into the impact of strategy changes on various forms of digital media
6418224 we continue to seek more effective ways to monetize investments in our search programs and one of the most underserved aspects of the advertising market today is the availability of operational systems that allow advertisers to see the impact of changes in strategy in one advertising channel like paid search on another advertising channel like organic search

6418258 invalid bounce suppression provides another compelling reason why organizations should also consider relaying their outbound email through an email security solution such as the barracuda spam firewall or barracuda spam firewall outbound

6418354 we tried to no avail to get money although there were tickets for athletes accommodations and feeding for ten persons but that government sponsor four persons we still could not get the money so we talked to george kailondo to credit money for gould and me minister gray thereby dropping the journalist and medic
6418355 the lnoc issued a ticket for gould to travel two days after the athletes and head coach left for senegal before then gould told me to do a letter to him so that the bank could give us a loan we gave him the letter but there was no money this is the very letter he is now using to say we passed the budget without giving the athletes per diem
6418356 we wrote leno travel agency and were credited a ticket to be paid for this budget year since gould took us 400 00 from the lnoc as per diem so kailondo gave me the balance us 3 000 for athletes per diem and incidental
6418357 i met gould in abidjan where i made him sign for us 1 550 00 for the five athletes and coach before reaching senegal i told the organizers that the athletes would be in cote divoire for ten hours so they should change the route the organizers gave mr gould an amount of 100 000 cfa as expenses made by the athletes but mr gould refused to give the money to the athletes
6418358 the team went ahead after the federation credited us 500
6418359 minister gray arrived in senegal some days later and told me he gray passed through guinea i challenge him to make his passport available to prove that he was in abidjan and spent one night there
6418360 it is true i signed for us 1 550 00 as per diem for the athletes in dakar in my hotel room he gray is claiming to have met me in abidjan to make it appear like i received the money there without giving it to the athletes
6418361 the us 1 550 00 was for the athletes and coach which i gave them but the 100 000cfa was received from the organizers and it happened at the end of the tournament
6418362 we expected that there would be some compensations to the federations for expenses incurred in preparing the athletes and also for participating but it was not so the athletes did not receive anything from the organizers so we raised the issue but the organizers said they didnt have any money for expenses incurred at the end of the discussion 100 000cfa was made available for whatsoever expenses made by each nation i signed for the money in minister grays presence
6418363 i returned us 360 00 in governments account eventhough gould wanted me to give him the money for the athletes
6418364 minister etmonia tarpeh called me and directed that us 400 00 would be given as my per diem by kailondo while minister gray would bring the us 1 550 00 to senegal later deputy minister marbue richards said us 1 500 00 would be given me by mr kailondo for the incidental apart from the us 400 00 before reaching kailondo minister richards told me that kailondo could not get all the money but assured that i would receive the funds through western union upon reaching so i took the 400usd and left with the understanding that the money would be sent by western union the money did not reach me as promised and there was no call from the sports ministry except anonymous calls to my previous number in dakar enquiring about liberias performance after a day or two minister richards called to ask if i had seen minister gray but in no time i saw minister gray entering the stadium to join us but said nothing that night about the money the next day he gray gave us 1 550 00 as per diem for the athletes and coach he kept the us 1 500 for incidental claiming that he only had us 950 00

6418530 he was trying to keep the house and the fields
6418531 afterward he wanted to leave but he was circled by soldiers it was impossible he was in the orchards hiding from the russians in case they lit the house he was walking and met the russian soldiers and he made up his mind that he couldnt stay any more the russian soldiers called him and asked where he was going if he was going to the american side
6418532 my husband said he was going to see his family
6418533 and the russians said again are you going to the american side

6418544 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader
6418545 to date the cftc has found that supply and demand fundamentals offer the best explanation for the systematic rise in oil prices
6418546 regardless of their classification the cftcs market surveillance group scrutinizes daily the positions of all large traders both commercial and non commercial to guard against market manipulation

6418563 the functionality of a signing statement is greatly reduced if it is too vague to identify the concerns of the president and the interpretation of the law that the president is trying to convey to the executive branch

6418852 i just feel like if folks want to put more than one sign in their yard then they ought to be allowed to
6418853 i believe this limitation was to prevent acluttered appearance and to support the sign ordinances purpose of protecting fayettevilles beauty
6418854 i know lots of places in fayetteville where there were bunches of signs and nothing was done about it if you had to look at it for a long time yeah but for a short period of time before the election i dont think its a problem

6418897 obama pledged yesterday to create millions of union jobs in alternative energy and to end tax breaks for companies that move jobs overseas using tough new populist language to persuade voters that he not republican rival john mccain is best positioned to lift the limping us economy
6418898 obama came to economically distressed southside alongside mark r warner a popular former governor who seven years ago made the strongest electoral showing in rural virginia of any statewide democratic candidate in a generation warner is running for u s senate and democrats hope he can help obama snare virginias 13 electoral votes the presumptive democratic presidential nominee spoke to workers laid off from nearby factories at a packed town hall meeting in a cavernous warehouse here used by patrick henry community college to train workers in the auto racing industry u s flags and race cars surrounded the stage
6418899 our study confirms that women experience significant bone loss due to cancer treatments and that zoledronic acid can prevent this loss
6418900 while our findings are promising its too early for us to recommend this drug for all premenopausal women undergoing chemotherapy for because we dont yet have all the information we need on dosing bone fractures
6418901 however this research does show we need to be more vigilant about monitoring patients bone densities before and during treatment so we can protect bone health and offset
6418902 the gop presidential candidate is mounting strong challenges to democratic rival barack obama in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania and eyeing minnesota four states that have thwarted republicans in at least four straight elections the arizona senator is also fighting to hang on to ohio a bellwether that president bush won twice
6418903 from the desolation of aliquippa where the jones amp laughlin steel mill loomed at the foot of the main boulevard to the fading beauty of beaver falls to the neatly tended homes of retired steel workers in hopewell one hears much hesitating talk about mr obama some simply quizzical or skeptically political and some not so subtly racial
6418904 i am predicting that tim kaine will be the vp pick and i think that this country will be blessed if that happens and i know barack will have a strong strong ticket
6418905 tim speaks very eloquently about the balance thats needed for energy and the compassion for people and the things that we believe in it just resonates
6418906 mccain cuts obamas lead by half why cant obama close
6418907 none of us thought we were being used or abused but we will see over time
6418908 got the gist of his statement if not his question
6418909 first of all im not a paid lobbyist for georgia i havent been for some time
6418910 but the difference between being a lobbyist and going on covert trips that are only disclosed later through aggressive media reporting is night and day the only reason everybody can talk about what business activities ive done in the past is because its been fully disclosed its been fully addressed by this campaign
6418911 it puts mccain in a position where he is not hearing all the positions he could be hearing
6418912 the queston is where do the loyalties lie when you have an economic relationship with somone for several years
6418913 even though you say you have a firewall between the lobbying firm and the campaign theres not a firewall in a persons soul
6418914 continues to be pushed around by both the obama campaign and public relations firms that are in the employ of the russians
6418915 it is no secret in fact its known openly that i worked for the georgians
6418916 it was a secret until this story broke that ambassador kurtzer before he accompanied senator obama on his middle east trip was in syria talking to senior syrian officials
6418917 it would seem to me the republican party is not as far as i can tell and i traveled to thousands of places last year a one issue party and that would just be one issue among many that would have to be evaluated by the party
6418918 but i believe the party will support senator mccains choice
6418919 a person that would allow us to sleep at night knowing that we had selected someone who could immediately be president of the united states
6418920 if sen obama is truly going to bring transparency to washington this is surely no way to do it
6418921 and maybe this is a playing out his negotiating with dictators and people like that without preconditions
6418922 then the he began to ask about scheunemanns extensive lobbying involvement with the country of georgia when he was abruptly disconnected

6418925 politicians love to turn their stories into great epics and sometimes they have to embellish to smooth out the story line
6418926 but now there are too many professional and amateur fact checkers
6418927 and there are hundreds if not thousands of bloggers who have detailed knowledge on specialized information so you really cant get away with stretching the truth anymore
6418928 mother teresa convinced cindy to take two babies in need of medical attention to the united states one of those babies is now their adopted daughter 16 year old bridget mccain

6418930 the very hospital and in the very room where her husband was brought after being shot down and then beaten by a mob during the war
6418931 mrs mccain asked to see the operating room and her husbands cell but was turned down she took the rejection philosophically its 27 years later lets go on mrs mccain said
6418932 at some point thereafter she toured the hospital and did coincidentally end up in the senators room
6418933 everybody tells white lies but in the political world its a little different because it raises the question that if people lie about little things are they also going to lie about big stuff that really matters
6418934 if it happens once you can say its a memory problem but if theres a pattern there theres a problem

6418950 he has oodles of natural ability but sometimes it looks like he is not completely 100 per cent committed if i was a team owner and paying a lot for a driver id want to know that the guy is giving the best he can
6418951 thats the good thing about this sport the drivers are not robots they are human beings and its down to them to tackle any given situation how they want
6418952 he is on or off but when hes on hes bloody good

6418966 i tried to pick it up around halfway and had the start of a good finish but then i just fell apart in the last 100 metres
6418967 if we have a perfect race then you can expect great things in our field if youre less than perfect from start to finish then its all over done you might as well pack up and go home

6418974 at this point in the back to school season we are seeing growth in orders in both our specialty and essentials segments excluding adoption revenues shipments in the first quarter were trailing the prior year only due to the timing of orders and the expected lower revenue opportunities in science adoptions
6418975 our specialty segment turned in a solid quarter with encouraging growth coming in our reading physical education and publishing categories we made significant progress advancing our reputation as a leading provider of value added educational content and curriculum solutions
6418976 our year over year gross profit was impacted by delayed shipments which we expect to recover in the second quarter
6418977 we also experienced higher transportation costs and unexpected raw material price increases from suppliers that we were not able to immediately pass on due to fixed pricing within contract agreements and longer lived catalogs in addition we were impacted by system integration issues that surfaced in the first quarter which are being proactively addressed and resolved we anticipate current gross margin levels to improve over the remainder of fiscal 2009 as we are able to adjust pricing in new catalogs bids and contracts
6418978 is to optimize our operational performance in what should be a good second quarter while taking steps to offset increased raw material and transportation costs through reductions in sg amp a expenses

6419024 please be assured that we share your love for harry potter and would certainly never do anything to hurt any of the films over the past ten years we have nurtured and protected each film and the integrity of the books upon which they are based to the best of our ability

6419029 the agreement must be approved by malikis council of ministers which includes iraqs kurdish president and two vice presidents one sunni and one shiite maliki has also pledged to submit it to iraqs fractious parliament
6419030 the two parties signed an agreement that said the judges will be restored within 24 hours of musharrafs impeachment
6419031 we honestly and sincerely want the coalition to work but the restoration of the judges was the central issue in our election campaign
6419032 we will definitely try our outmost to ensure that they will not pull out because we have promised to work together to serve the country
6419033 the judges restoration issue is not as simple as mr sharif thinks
6419034 in the past they the government have sat in the drawing rooms making big decisions we want to do it through the parliamentary process
6419035 we found that the odor profile coming from the skin of skin cancer patients was markedly different than that coming from healthy skin
6419036 so we think that this kind of biomarker could be used in a rapid and noninvasive way to detect skin cancer
6419037 and this would be novel because now the only way to do so is with a visual exam and a biopsy which is of course invasive
6419038 but i think within a few years its reasonable to say that this could end up being a diagnostic tool that would be a routine thing one could do in a doctors office its a real possibility
6419039 in terms of this replacing the standard method we have of diagnosing skin cancer which is basically to look at a specimen under the microscope its hard to imagine this would do it completely
6419040 because when youre dealing with cancer the margin for error is really small you dont want to miss something that may be a cancer that then doesnt get treated and you dont want to treat someone for cancer if they actually have something else so its really a very novel and interesting idea but one which i think really needs to be further researched and carefully confirmed

6419050 it falls short of being four 1 records in a row i think with the jonas brothers second week
6419051 half of that is more than what well sell and its good for those guys all i can say is weve been here for 10 years and this is our sixth record i feel proud to be able to say that if its not 1 its not 1 what are you going to do
6419052 but its just a different version of the boy band thing all over again
6419053 we went in and started writing and the songs that were coming out werent the heaviest songs but they were really good songs
6419054 we wrote 14 songs and there are 13 on the album there was only one song that didnt make it and it wasnt because it didnt stand up i just couldnt come up with anything to sing over it musically it was one of my favorite songs on the record i just couldnt come up with anything that was worthy of it in a melody and lyrical sense the songs we were writing were great songs we couldnt cast them aside and say no those arent heavy enough if we had wed probably still be there writing
6419055 i hope theyre happy surprised and that they can just realize that we wrote the best songs we could
6419056 we work very hard to grow as a band and i think we made a pretty good step this time
6419057 the only thing i know that really changed for me was when i should have been upstairs in my room working on songs i was playing with the kids
6419058 or if i was upstairs working on songs it was just like ok now i want to go play with the kids
6419059 youre doing it on the spot and not really going home and working on stuff rehearsing parts youre figuring it out and doing it right there in the studio
6419060 despite their ineptitude in a lot of other areas and how poor they are at governing one of the things the bush administration has been very good at is using administrative mechanisms to control policy outcomes
6419061 i have worked on regulatory issues inside the beltway since 1976 and have watched five presidents come and go
6419062 the bush administration is the most hostile and aggressive toward these agencies by a couple of orders of magnitude making the reagan era look relatively benign
6419063 no matter who is elected in november it will take years to repair this damage
6419064 politics is injected and elevated into decisions where science and rational judgment should prevail
6419065 politics supersedes scientific and technical information that is critical to protecting our environment and health and safety at home and in the workplace
6419066 many of the politicization scandals in this administration came from cases where unqualified or inexperienced people got into key jobs often with the power to hire others or control information flows
6419067 despite the presidents promise to bring business like thinking to the federal government the bush administration has overseen or at least permitted a significant expansion of both the height and width of the federal hierarchy
6419068 there have never been more layers at the top of government nor more occupants at each layer
6419069 weve been particularly concerned that some of the scientific community is being co opted by political manipulation and that policy is being presented as fact
6419070 the power to coordinate information collection and to review proposed final regulations in a policy office of the white house made omb the equivalent of a political censor over agency actions
6419071 protect his right to select appointees based not only on their managerial prowess but also on their commitment to his policy agenda and their ability to advance articulate and defend it
6419072 one of the things this administration is going to be most known for is that they provided a lot of special access for business interests
6419073 theyve allowed an unprecedented level of involvement by private interests in creating political policy with regard to regulation with regard to rules their energy policy their greenhouse gas policy all of that
6419074 not since oira was created has there been a less appropriate nominee
6419075 dudleys work shows that she is not so much prejudiced against regulation as wary of it
6419076 dudley will bring to the job a wariness of new rules and an expertise in analyzing rules likely effects both of which are appropriate even essential
6419077 a string of meltdowns that will make the federal response to hurricane katrina look like a minor mistake
6419078 i would promote more career professionals into key positions not enough use is being made of civil servants
6419079 the civil service was created to provide expert and continuous management of government the increase in appointees has hurt both the cultivation of expertise and the continuity of management
6419080 we dont need ideological stowaways undermining the work of the next administration
6419081 the history of these issues demonstrates that at some point the pendulum reaches a limit in its rightward swing
6419082 i think that point passed about two years ago and that it has already begun to swing back how long it will take to traverse the arc is the real question

6419097 what about the god of abraham moses jesus and muhammad
6419098 i loved the story telling of jazz and the freedom it offered to interpret and move around inside the melody at that point id realized the limitations of a lot of contemporary music and was hungry for something challenging singing jazz began to stretch me professionally and emotionally these songs make you reveal a story
6419099 im really happy with how jazz has helped me connect my feelings with those of people long ago and of today too and how its helped me to forge a great new community of musical friends and influences
6419100 i realized that singing and entertaining was my purpose and that i wanted to have a positive effect on peoples every day enjoyment of life
6419101 seven years and five albums deep ive got a resume and track record
6419102 ive proved my point which is why i decided to call the album avant because it reflects who i am i have more confidence as a singer and songwriter and as a result this record came outreally strong and im really pleased with it the idea for this record was to come with something new and with this album thats exactly what i did
6419103 because no matter what in any relationship theres going to be someone getting hurt so in the song i say to the woman that when it hurts will we still be the same two lovers if you hurt mehow can i get over it or how will you the nature of the song is asking can we still get past the pain and be with each other
6419104 i know that my fans expect and look to me for the way i try and come across with a love song
6419105 but at the same time as a songwriter i also know theres nothing new under the sun
6419106 sometimes when youre going through life you just want to sit back relax and think on everything thats going on and for me
6419107 thats one of the great things about being in r amp b because im always able to give people my vibe im blessed to be able to be an artist that can give you my lyrics i feel like i know how to bring a hit of my own across in some ways i think what separates me from the pack is the writing aspect when youre able to write your own material you dont have to always be out there searching for a hit i feel like im more in tune and in touch with my fans because i know what it is that they want from me so i can just give all the glory to god for making me a creator
6419108 its always beautiful working with snoop every time i see him he tells me how much his wife loves me im her top r amp b singer
6419109 ive never really had some sort of game plan when it comes to making my records
6419110 this time i really wanted to just get into the studio and make great music

6419134 i love his music and ive been singing his songs for so many years
6419135 we learned jazz together and played all those gigs in chicago together when i was coming up
6419136 at the time no one else was recording contemporary pop tunes in a jazz vein
6419137 i do feel like a postmodern pioneer soon after all music began to be viewed as viable material for jazz vocalists and instrumentalists the old repertoire distinctions between popular music and jazz were falling away
6419138 many jazz fans have lost the ability to imagine the future yet anything innovative in jazz vocals has taken place in spite of people lamenting the loss of sarah peggy carmen and ella
6419139 people try to appropriate copyright and own the music but it refuses to be contained in spite of the people who dont want to see musicchange it finds its way like water coursing through rocks
6419140 more than a poet more than a singer more than a songwriter none of these categories alone can do justice to the fullness of her artistic presentation

6419142 the most convincing jazz singer songwriter since peggy lee her dark imagery gripping interpretations and propulsive piano playing are among the great wonders of contemporary music
6419143 though listeners have come to expect illuminating results from patricia barber live a fortnight in france represents another significant stride during the past few years she has reached beyond merely interpreting jazz and pop standards and she reiterates the point with some of the most erudite jazz songwriting being penned today
6419144 i love that last line do you think of me at all theres also a white black dichotomy all the way through like snow with jazz and salt with oil
6419145 he said no but he could if i wanted him to so he plays on this song as if hes half drunk then slips into his typical chris potter brilliant piece of playing
6419146 it was pretty exciting to have chris play on this album
6419147 i wanted saxophone for this record and ive admired his playing its amazing how he blows on just one of those things and how perfectly he plays in the still of the night that we fly through with a samba beat i told chris that i wanted him to make his sax solo sound like he just walked into the session and then just walked out and the way chris and eric play at the end well its wild
6419148 chris is more or less astounding and i played melodica to give it a french feeling
6419149 i also sang it before we warmed up for the days sessions so my voice comes out sounding gruff and very french
6419150 i asked neal to play some lonely town sounds on his guitar and that old fashioned rock snare groove makes the song sound even lonelier
6419151 its rangy stuck in a slow bossa beat and lyrically one of cole porters best
6419152 most guitar bands and r amp b acts sound very similar to each other yet theyre miles apart im interested in creating music which is a mix of black and white music where there are no boundaries or prejudice

6419154 im attracted to the seventies because that was when i was growing up but musically ill try anything if its good ill use it

6419192 given the ease with which programming and distribution via the apps store has been made by apple one would imagine it is only a matter of time before some smart gay programmers are out there releasing gay themed rpgs utilities and other software on the device apple are only charging a bare minimum set up cost for the adk 100 at time of writing and they take care of all distribution and credit card transactions though they take a 30 cut which is more than fair linked to the software developed or you can put it up as a free application
6419193 technically the iphone also has additional features your other gaming handhelds lack features like the gps and camera could add additional functionality to games these aside though the accessibility of the iphone for developers is where its way ahead of the pack and with this accessibility should hopefully come an array of games which throw old conventions out the window

6419196 i think we just need to be more effective at the breakdown and more precise
6419197 at times weve had numbers there and not taken the guys away its definitely an area we need to improve because australia have got fantastic fetchers as well

6419224 it is excellent news that so many young people have taken part and made such a positive contribution through the youth opportunity and youth capital funds this shows that when young people are given a chance they can rise to the occasion and gain respect from their wider community
6419225 its particularly promising to see that the funds have helped las to reach disadvantaged and hard to reach young people who are so often rejected by their communities i congratulate all the young people involved for doing so well and the local authorities for making good use of the funds
6419226 young people are faced with increasingly diverse choices so it is essential that we have excellent information advice and guidance in place to help them such as here at the hub in crewe this centre and the research issued today shows just how much this countrys young people can achieve when given a chance
6419227 the building and facilities at this new centre the hub of youth activity in the area are second to none
6419228 connexions aim is to widen access to a whole range of activities information and support for all young people when and where they need it the hub will provide that here in crewe and we will continue to listen to young people as well as giving them the help and support they want

6419231 it is clear that the current system of providing care not just in northamptonshire but across the country will need to change if adequate support is to be provided for those in need
6419232 the government is engaging the public and key stakeholders to consider the core issues and to inform the development of a new care and support system and this is why it is key that people in northamptonshire have their say on this very important issue which affects every one of us
6419233 in 2012 we will stage a spectacular sporting event but i am also determined that london should realise the potential that the 2012 games offer to make our city greater still through the legacy that we can leave for generations to come
6419234 a huge amount of our investment in the olympic park is for legacy
6419235 since my election as mayor i have insisted on new focus and more impetus in planning and delivering this long term legacy

6419237 its no exaggeration to say that the future of london lies in the five host boroughs of greenwich tower hamlets hackney waltham forest and newham the olympic park sits at the heart of an area of unrivalled opportunity for business one of the largest urban development sites in europe
6419238 were looking for the worlds most creative minds to bring their ideas and investment to this the most exciting area of london to add to the buzz that the 2012 games is already generating and to underpin the areas growing prosperity and development
6419239 we want to ensure that the legacy development of the olympic park captures any truly exceptional ground breaking ideas from around the world whether it is an event iconic development or attraction we want to hear ideas that could complement and enhance our ambitions for europes largest urban regeneration project

6419244 social enterprises draw on a diverse range of talent that delivers innovative approaches to some of the most challenging social problems
6419245 bame women can have a better understanding of the issues facing their communities than anyone else so supporting them in particular has great potential to help improve those communities this report is an important contribution to the governments drive to encourage and support more people who want to become social entrepreneurs
6419246 encouraging enterprising women from bame communities to connect with social enterprise should be an absolute priority as it will benefit not only those communities but the uk economy as a whole
6419247 social enterprise promotes economic growth and provides meaningful employment across the uk and is empowering and effective among communities that have been traditionally excluded from mainstream business

6419305 the information apple gives is vague were guessing it will sort problems like 3g glitches and lost calls

6419320 let not the gospel on being introduced into any new land destroy or extinguish whatever its people possess that is naturally good just or beautiful for the church when she calls a person to higher culture and better way of life under the inspiration of the christian religion does not act like one who recklessly cuts down and uproots a thriving forest

6419366 people tend not to retain that type of advert so its vital that the details such as the domain name are memorable if an advert is viewed at a time when a person isnt specifically seeking a particular service such as when theyre on the train to work recall is likely to be low having a domain name that people will remember a week or a month later when they do need the same type of service is a benefit to any business

6419394 it is still a lot easier for an asian actress to break into hollywood
6419395 as much as hollywood is global they have to sell tickets and in the u s which is their big market it is about middle america they need an actor who can help open at theaters and sell dvds an asian actress can get a good support role or be the love interest

6419412 they came and asked us for wine but first we had to drink it ourselves to show that it was not poisoned then they drank the wine themselves and then they said to leave this place as soon as possible otherwise they would kill us the russians were looking for anyone who had soldiers in their home if anyone had a georgian soldier at home they burned the houses immediately
6419413 he was trying to keep the house and the fields
6419414 afterward he wanted to leave but he was circled by soldiers it was impossible he was in the orchards hiding from the russians in case they lit the house he was walking and met the russian soldiers and he made up his mind that he couldnt stay any more the russian soldiers called him and asked where he was going if he was going to the american side
6419415 my husband said he was going to see his family
6419416 and the russians said again are you going to the american side
6419417 so the russians view you as the american side even though there are no americans here

6419421 were very confident our data supports that homes do indeed contribute to fire suppression costs
6419422 the bottom line is how much land needs to be protected
6419423 whats saving us is we still only have 1 million people
6419424 as we go fight fire to protect peoples homes and they dont burn who are we saving money for
6419425 it may be all the way from voluntary to you go do it period
6419426 that type of trend is sure to impact fire suppression costs

6419439 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6419440 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6419441 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6419442 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6419443 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6419444 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6419445 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6419446 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6419447 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6419448 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6419449 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6419450 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6419451 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6419452 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6419453 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6419454 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6419455 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

6419460 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6419461 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6419462 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6419463 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6419464 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6419465 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6419466 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6419467 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6419468 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6419469 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6419470 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas

6419475 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6419476 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6419477 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6419478 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6419479 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6419481 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6419482 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

6419487 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
6419488 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class

6419495 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
6419496 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6419497 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6419498 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6419499 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6419500 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo

6419507 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6419508 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6419509 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza

6419512 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6419513 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6419514 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6419515 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6419516 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6419517 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6419518 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6419519 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6419520 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6419521 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6419522 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

6419524 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6419525 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6419526 and then youll be like daddy just flushing your poop down
6419527 stupak identified goldman sachs and morgan stanley as firms whose oil trading activities warranted closer review
6419528 were not investigating goldman sachs or anybody were looking at the macro picture not the micro
6419529 all those speculators getting the blame for driving up the price these days just who are they
6419530 your pension fund manager may be using your retirement money to drive up the price of oil
6419531 what would happen if pension fund managers decided to increase their commodity investment by another 20 fold
6419532 clear similarity between the speculators and arbitragers of today and smiths corn merchants

6419534 right now wall street traders are raising gas prices with nothing more than the click of a mouse
6419535 their trading is speculative and not for the legitimate business needs of a user or producer

6419539 when the futures contracts for june near maturity the investment bank will sell them to a commercial user and use the money to buy july contacts
6419540 by making consumers feel the inconveniences of a dearth somewhat earlier than they might otherwise do he prevents their feeling them afterwards so severely as they certainly would do if the cheapness of price encouraged them to consume faster than suited the real scarcity of the season

6419543 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6419544 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6419545 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6419546 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6419547 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6419548 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6419549 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6419550 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6419551 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6419552 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6419553 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6419554 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6419555 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6419556 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6419557 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6419558 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6419559 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6419560 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6419561 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6419562 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6419563 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6419564 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6419565 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6419566 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6419567 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6419568 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6419569 we suffer from a fiscal cancer it is growing inside us
6419570 our country would need 53 trillion invested today which is about 175 000 per person to deliver on the governments obligations and promises how much of this 53 trillion do we have zip

6419574 michigan is for the most part a red state and its up to detroit and the
6419575 and unless we have someone out front whos able to speak and carry obamas message well its critical
6419576 we have a number of people who can stand with sen obama as a surrogate
6419577 shortly after the convention were going to have a come to jesus meeting to decide who are going to be the individuals to carry that message and carry obama around the state and around detroit
6419578 right now i think thats going to be a big challenge to make sure detroiters turn out
6419579 saddam hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors or the world with nuclear arms poison gas or biological weapons other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles with saddam there is one big difference he has used them not once but repeatedly i have no doubt today that left unchecked saddam hussein will use these terrible weapons again
6419580 you allow someone like saddam hussein to get nuclear weapons ballistic missiles chemical weapons biological weapons how many people is he going to kill with such weapons we are not going to allow him to succeed
6419581 threat posed by iraqs refusal to end its wmd programs
6419582 every nation has to be either for us or against us those who harbor terrorists or who finance them are going to pay a price
6419583 iraq continues to be a safe haven transit point or operational node for groups and individuals who direct violence against the united states saddams intelligence service supported financially ansar al islam whose members were being trained in al qaeda camps in afghanistan
6419584 husseins vigorous pursuit of biological chemical and nuclear weapons and his present and potential future support for terrorist acts and organizations make him a terrible danger to the people of the united states
6419585 my position is very clear the time has come for decisive action to eliminate the threat posed by saddam husseins wmds
6419586 every day saddam gets closer to his long term goal of nuclear capability
6419587 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat to the u s and our allies
6419588 to defend the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq
6419589 saddam is in material breach the legitimacy of the security council is at stake and if the security council does not call for the use of force i think we have little option but to act with a larger group of willing nations if possible and alone if we must
6419590 yes saddam has chemical weapons he has biological weapons he is trying to get nuclear weapons
6419591 the world is far safer with the removal of saddam
6419592 ich sah wie das flugzeug in mehrere teile zerrissen wurde
6419593 dann gab es eine heftige explosion ich hatte zuerst gedacht die maschine w re dabei zu landen aber dann neigte sie sich pl tzlich zur seite und bohrte sich mit der rechten tragfl che in die erde
6419594 es war alles schwarz und verbrannt die leichen waren so hei dass wir uns beim wegtragen die finger verbrannten
6419595 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6419596 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6419597 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6419598 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6419599 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6419600 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6419601 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6419602 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6419603 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6419604 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6419605 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6419606 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6419607 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6419608 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6419609 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6419610 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6419611 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6419612 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6419613 we had reports of groups of 15 and 16 year olds fighting with batons and sticks in the street after a house party
6419614 they had been drinking and there was glass on the floor
6419615 it was like being in beirut there were about 30 teenagers drunk and running riot in the street
6419616 despite the fact that most days you refuse to talk to me lilah i know plenty about you i know the obvious things like youre a determined woman looking to make a mark in the world i know youve got a great sense of humor and i know that you used to have long hair im guessing you had it cut short when your last boyfriend did a number on you
6419617 ive seen your drive to get your business up and running the same thing drives me if you possess it yourself then its easy to see in others i have on occasion heard you laugh its the thing i look forward to each day i come to work for you and your hair well i see you touch your neck during the day as if youre reaching for something a sense of security your identity
6419618 when you got your heart broke you changed that identity and made a new you
6419619 you made a new you lilah a new and very very beautiful you
6419620 sj lvklart r det ett utspel det handlar om idag n got f rdigt paket och lagf rslag har ingen av oss talat om
6419621 netgong is an extremely valuable tool for system and network administrators
6419622 we believe current and future customers will find the new version even more powerful and convenient especially in an era when critical networks can require instantaneous management and analysis by professionals
6419623 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6419624 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6419625 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6419626 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6419627 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6419628 four key deficits budget savings balance of payments and leadership
6419629 cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
6419630 we need a grass roots effort to changed the thinking in congress
6419631 i dont see many young people in the audience so thats a disconcerting thing we need to have a lot of youth that are active in terms of shutting down this government this governments out of control its spending too much money we had representative ron paul who was running he was actually speaking wisdom and what did the republican party do they laughed at him
6419632 its exciting to see this but depressing because we have no one to solve these problems
6419633 the federal government is working with corporations to send out jobs to china and mexico
6419634 i see no local politicians involved in this where are they
6419635 we need to save money and our children today are not being trained to save in high school there isnt even training to balance a checkbook
6419636 we want instant gratification when i grew up you didnt buy something unless you needed it we need to look at ourselves in this
6419637 this problem is endemic to us all were buying things we dont want its up to us to say to congress cease and desist spending what we dont have
6419638 every local and county budget has to be balanced we need to move this to state and federal government
6419639 we need to get rid of the two party system and the stranglehold that the media has on that or we will always have what weve always had period
6419640 i think we really need to connect the dots between individuals and the government because the problems are very similar a lot of people have too much mortgage debt too much credit debt the more we create that financial discipline at the individual level i think it will cause a political groundswell that will shine the spotlight on the federal government as well
6419641 were in trouble unless we vote for someone who will raise taxes and no one will vote for them
6419642 i hope we can get a series of articles on what needs to be done we need to look at ourselves to stop spending what we dont have we are a spoiled country
6419643 our attitude should be not spending more than we have
6419644 our situation is a lot worse than advertised and we need to start making some tough choices if we want our future to be better than our past
6419645 were mortgaging the future of people who cant vote and might not even be born yet
6419646 weve got a super subprime crisis brewing namely the federal governments finances
6419647 the factors that caused the mortgage based subprime crisis to explode exist for the governments finances the difference is its 25 times at least bigger
6419648 our trade equation guarantees massive foreign investment in the u s when we force feed 2 billion daily to the rest of the world they must invest in something here
6419649 when they said this year that there was a possibility theyd team up the two creepiest bad guys i got so excited i had a list of people i wanted to work with and he was on it
6419650 in the first two episodes just dont blink or youll miss a lot there is more action than youve ever seen at once before
6419651 its six of one half a dozen of another its much more convenient for me because i live in los angeles i know where i am all the time im no longer pulling onto the side of the road at 4 a m crying and calling the production because i cant find where were shooting finally they had to have someone come get me on a daily basis
6419652 but i loved working in texas on location its like going away to college youre close to the whole crew and everyone youre working with
6419653 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6419654 they told me there are going to be resources here
6419655 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6419656 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6419657 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6419658 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6419659 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6419660 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6419661 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6419662 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6419663 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6419664 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6419665 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6419666 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6419667 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6419668 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6419669 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6419670 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6419671 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6419672 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6419673 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6419674 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6419675 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6419676 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6419677 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6419678 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6419679 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6419680 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6419681 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6419682 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6419683 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keeps on skyrocketing
6419684 when you find out that you lost your healthcare your pension or you never had it it turns out youre not the only one
6419685 millions of americans have been going through that same loss of security
6419686 these tend to be folks that relocate here they tend to be younger voters also folks who obviously based on their lifestyle would be open to the prescription for change sen obama is offering
6419687 barack obama can spend all the money in the world in some of these republican leaning states but he will still be the most inexperienced presidential candidate in the modern era and he will still have the most liberal record in the united states senate
6419688 he is more liberal than a lot of the state
6419689 its going to be a very difficult race for him in north carolina
6419690 he cant make any promises that are going to help us tomorrow
6419691 its going to be a long time coming out of this
6419692 for the dogs this is fun this is playtime for them so as much effort as these dogs are putting forth they enjoy this its playing off their natural instincts theyre having a great time
6419693 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
6419694 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
6419695 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6419696 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
6419697 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
6419698 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
6419699 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
6419700 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
6419701 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6419702 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6419703 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6419704 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6419705 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6419706 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6419707 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6419708 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6419709 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6419710 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6419711 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6419712 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
6419713 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6419714 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6419715 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
6419716 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6419717 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
6419718 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
6419719 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
6419720 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
6419721 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
6419722 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6419723 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6419724 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6419725 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6419726 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6419727 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6419728 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6419729 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6419730 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
6419731 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
6419732 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
6419733 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
6419734 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
6419735 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
6419736 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
6419737 many in the christian right tend to get their information
6419738 the red white and blue bunting that drapes the porches here has given way recently to bed sheets hung on front fences and scrawled with protest slogans
6419739 the unrest stems from plans to build an expansive new home for the elderly in the middle of this neighborhoods 30 acre country club
6419740 designed by frederick law olmsted jr son of the mastermind behind central park in new york city the neighborhood was created and later preserved to interrupt this citys concrete sprawl with an oasis of big sky and lush fields
6419741 residents say the proposed development is a betrayal of that vision and the project has sparked a family feud of sorts pitting those who stayed in the neighborhood against those who run the country club but have moved to grander suburbs
6419742 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6419743 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6419744 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6419745 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
6419746 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6419747 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6419748 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6419749 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6419750 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6419751 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6419752 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6419753 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6419754 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6419755 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6419756 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6419757 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6419758 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6419759 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6419760 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6419761 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6419762 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6419763 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6419764 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6419765 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6419766 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6419767 the good rain across time and terrain in the pacific northwest
6419768 seit ich in china den ersten paddelschlag gemacht habe qu le ich mich
6419769 ich h tte mir das schon ein bisschen anders vorgestellt es ist ein bisschen der wurm drin vielleicht kommt freitag eine trotzreaktion aber ich erwarte keine wunder ich kann nicht mit einem rennen vier sekunden schneller fahren
6419770 seit ich in china den ersten paddelschlag gemacht habe qu le ich mich insofern kann ich nicht genau sagen woran es liegt
6419771 aber die situation jetzt ist deutlich schwerer als die in athen
6419772 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
6419773 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
6419774 the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot later that day we were informed that it was a costume
6419775 1 trifling minimal 2 of a fact or thing so insignificant that a court may overlook it in deciding an issue or case
6419776 after drinking more alcohol the four ended up in a bedroom of the residence with all four engaging in mutually consented sexual conduct
6419777 at one point while the four were engaged in sex in the bedroom salinas started arguing with the defendant and the two men started pushing each other while still naked
6419778 gave varying and conflicting accounts on how the fight started
6419779 he could detect the odor of intoxicants emitted from the defendant that was the odor associated with someone sobering up after a long night of drinking
6419780 eyes were bloodshot and glossy and he complained of feeling hung over his shorts were covered in blood
6419781 this project has received a lot of attention from osce delegations and we are looking at the possibility of implementing similar projects in other regions of ukraine we came to novobogdanivka to study how effectively the equipment provided by the osce has been used and to learn about the progress made by ukraines ministry for emergency situations in cleaning up the ammunition site
6419782 part doonesbury part bill james part graduate seminar in literature the soxaholix is part of a countermovement much of it online to reclaim the team for its true fans
6419783 blogdoms best red sox blog the history of the red sox one panel at a time

6419786 your site absolutely rocks i immediately bookmarked it keep up the tremendous work
6419787 all the cool red sox fans are addicted to the soxaholix
6419788 were as shocked as you are but there is apparently at least one member of red sox nation with a sense of humor and perspective
6419789 this is by far one of the most entertaining baseball blogs ive seen
6419790 go directly to the minah leagues and do not pass pawtucket but go directly to portland
6419791 clay dude i got your white trash ass out of lumberton i got you a no hitter and this is the thanks i get
6419792 i mean cmon dude dont make me have to change my parable to let clay buchholz cast the first mofo stone as he hasnt a chance in hell of hitting anybody with it
6419793 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6419794 it is hopeless this one is like the other one they are all the same nothing will change dont expect change
6419795 hell have to be good to israel if not he wont be re elected to a second term
6419796 will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
6419797 the arabs need america to be straight and unbiased but anyway we feel that american policy will not be changed too much
6419798 one day he is with the palestinian cause one day hes with israel we have a saying here whats better a black dog or a white dog its all the same for us nothing will change
6419799 we rooted for this and that and nothing happened its deja vu
6419800 unless the americans realize that they really have to change and become more evenhanded and apply justice in the region things will be the same
6419801 obama is excellent he is direct he is like the successor to jfk
6419802 yes they are all bad but still obama might be a little less bad
6419803 for me it doesnt matter that hes black or his name is hussein
6419804 hes an american and so i disagree with most of what he says about the arab world i mean condoleezza rice was black and poor and she still invaded iraq
6419805 i think its very impressive that someone can start very poor and reach the top like this
6419806 es ist einfacher in peking zu schwimmen als hier durchzukommen
6419807 das ist der gr te erfolg in der geschichte des klubs
6419808 f r mich ist heute ein traum in erf llung gegangen wer sich ber bronze nicht freuen kann soll bei olympia gar nicht erst antreten
6419809 ich wusste schon dass er stark ist dass er gewinnt h tte ich nicht gedacht
6419810 das hat mich viel kraft gekostet und auch ge rgert
6419811 die leuk mie hat mich gelehrt schritt f r schritt zu machen
6419812 wenn du im krankenhaus liegst schmerzen hast dich m de f hlst dann denkst du nicht an die n chste woche du denkst nur an die n chste stunde du wirst geduldig du liegst in deinem bett und wartest das ist die gleiche strategie die ich heute im rennen angewendet habe geduldig im pulk schwimmen ruhig bleiben und auf die chance warten
6419813 yeah were looking forward to coming back to carlisle and playing songs from the new album outdoor concerts during the summer are always good fun
6419814 the vue cinema show was a new thing a first for us so it was cool being invited to be part of the itunes festival was incredible
6419815 carlisle will be our last concert until the arena tour but well be doing loads of stuff mainly rehearsing for the tour we wont have much time to relax
6419816 i saw him in concert when he played in london recently
6419817 for the last four years weve only done the uk but we want to concentrate on the worldwide side were planning some dates in brazil and the usa is on our wish list
6419818 theyre never allowed to block a fire hydrant but they do it
6419819 i believe hes a big kid or he wouldnt go around intimidating people who are just doing their job
6419820 i think the proliferation of video technology does in some sense level the playing field
6419821 when we think about the citizen eyewitnesses that have brought to light some egregious police conduct that no one would have believed the benefit is unquestionable
6419822 hes going to have to be very careful not to bow to public pressure and not bow to emotion
6419823 or if you have to get a new cellphone get one with a video function
6419824 send it in to your local authorities or post it on youtube or other video sharing sites
6419825 you can call it a vendetta if you want because thats what it is
6419826 its about the citys predatory policy of ticketing to raise revenue
6419827 i definitely try to pick it up when the camera is on
6419828 sometimes we do have to make u turns sometimes we do have to park here and there
6419829 this man wants to glorify himself and get some ratings
6419830 for too long weve been abused by the public and the media were not going to be a punching bag anymore in new york city
6419831 teo ma che combini perch ti ficchi in bocca le polpette intere
6419832 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6419833 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6419834 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6419835 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6419836 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6419837 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6419838 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6419839 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6419840 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6419841 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6419842 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6419843 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6419844 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6419845 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6419846 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6419847 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6419848 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6419849 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6419850 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6419851 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6419852 i have always believed that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms
6419853 but i also identify with the need for crime ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common sense effective safety measures
6419854 the realization was for me that once they came to know jane austens back story they began to discuss the reasons that austen put her characters in certain situations and the reasons that characters reacted certain ways
6419855 the students looked deeper into the book as a work of art created by a specific and special person
6419856 controlling almost everything very closely leaving very little elbow room for them
6419857 i dont think anyone will buy the iphone at this price but there is hope for airtel and vodafone if they have a store near a mental hospital provided the patient has enough money with him
6419858 i buy bio oil in south africa its great for scars and you can pick up a large bottle for 6
6419859 i stock up on strivectin eye cream when im in america a tube is 29 in bloomingdales compared with 59 here i also have paraffin wax pedicures in africa and india
6419860 i always tell friends about the medina mayrit in madrid where you can take authentic arab baths and have massages there are three pools at different temperatures and a turkish steam bath
6419861 i cant live without happyderm by lor al as it helps to keep my face well hydrated during flights and i buy dead sea skin products from tel aviv
6419862 social networking sites are just another way that people say things or do things that come back and haunt them
6419863 the things that people say online or leave online are pretty permanent
6419864 pending sentencing you should be going to alcoholics anonymous you should be in therapy you should be in a program to learn to deal with drinking and driving
6419865 she was doing nothing other than having a good old time
6419866 when you take those pictures like that its a hell of an impact
6419867 i did feel that gave me some indication of how that young man was feeling a short time after a near fatal accident that he thought it was appropriate to joke and mock about the possibility of going to prison
6419868 the pictures showed a kid who didnt know what to do two weeks after this accident
6419869 if it shows up under your name you own it
6419870 and you better understand that people look for that stuff
6419871 one of the hallmarks of apple is that they mainstream stuff thats been the sole domain of techies
6419872 in our case thats moving internet radio into the car
6419873 none of them have changed the way i use the internet or how i go about productivity in my life
6419874 but right now its all just getting started its the potential thats exciting
6419875 i believe setting a deadline for withdrawal would demoralize the iraqi people would encourage killers across the broader middle east and send a signal that america will not keep its commitment
6419876 the great difference the great difference with obama is that i intend to win
6419877 mister mark twain when told of his own death remarked that the report of his demise had been greatly exaggerated in my case the report has simply been one of optimistic anticipation by those who wished to use my words and works without payin
6419878 199 things i would have written had i not died first
6419879 we say something which can not be true and then prove to you that it is
6419880 there is one prerequisite for a mammatus formation a big thunderstorm because they form on the back edge of retreating storms
6419881 the lighting is just right in this photo but mammatus formations are not just a british phenomenon they can be seen all over the world
6419882 these visually arresting clouds draw attention to the beauty and drama of what is happening in the sky and people spend too long looking at their feet
